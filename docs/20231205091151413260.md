  這種有趣的挑戰讓球隊更加團結，也展現出Lue的領導力和球員間的良好關係。這也是快艇隊在球場外建立起的強大氣場，讓球員們無所不用其極為了達成挑戰。 

The video of Tyronn Lue and the Los Angeles Clippers team has been released by the Clippers community today. In the video, the head coach challenges his team to a free throw competition. If Lue makes both shots, the entire team has to run the full court and back. However, if he misses both shots, the team's practice session is over.

From the video, we can see that the team accepts the challenge and Lue successfully makes the first shot. But as he prepares for the second shot, his teammates start to frantically interfere, using their height advantage to block his shot. Some even sneakily push him or throw their jerseys in the air to distract him. Despite the team's efforts, Lue remains focused and makes the second shot, leading to the entire team having to run the full court and back.

This fun challenge showcases the team's unity and highlights Lue's leadership and strong relationship with his players. It also demonstrates the powerful team culture that the Clippers have built off the court, as the players will go to extreme measures to achieve a challenge.
