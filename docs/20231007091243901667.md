  PLG New Taipei Kings sign Asian import Hayden to strengthen their lineup for the new East Asia Super League (EASL) season.

The New Taipei Kings have announced the signing of Asian import Hayden Blankley for the upcoming season of the East Asia Super League (EASL). Hayden, who joined the Bay Area Dragons in 2022 as a rookie in professional basketball, has shown impressive performance in the PBA league, and the Kings have decided to partner with him for the new season. 

At 23 years old, Hayden was born in New South Wales, Australia, and is of Asian descent. Standing at 198cm tall, he played college basketball in the NCAA Division II for West Texas A&M University. In 2022, he began his professional career with the Bay Area Dragons in Hong Kong, where he played 24 games in the PBA league, averaging 13.4 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game, with a three-point shooting percentage of 40.3%. He once scored 47 points in a single game, making 10 three-pointers, and helped the Bay Area Dragons finish as runners-up in the league that season. 

In the previous EASL season, Hayden played three games, contributing an average of 9.7 points, 4 rebounds, and a 53% three-point shooting percentage. He is known for his excellent shooting ability and agile off-ball movement. Recently, he returned to Australia to join the NBL1 team, the Bendigo Braves, where he has been averaging 21.9 points and 10.8 rebounds per game. 

With his outstanding shooting skills and versatility, Hayden will join the New Taipei Kings and compete in six group stage games in the EASL, aiming to help the team advance to the top four and achieve better results. General Manager Mao Gaen stated, "When Hayden challenged the PBA last year, we observed that his playing style is well-suited for the Kings. His height and playing style allow him to cover positions 2, 3, and even fill in at the 4. He is a selfless team player who does not dominate the ball, and his ability to help the team create offensive space will be of great assistance. With the Kings having many experienced guards, we believe that Hayden's combination with them will be a major weapon for the New Taipei Kings in their challenge for the East Asia Super League."
