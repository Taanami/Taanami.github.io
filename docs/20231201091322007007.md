  2023 TGF World Fire Cup Basketball Tournament Player Interview: Shengsheng Fire U Chen Hao and Wang Zhonghan

Chen Hao and Wang Zhonghan, the key players who led Jianguo High School to win two consecutive championships in the past two years, have been teammates for nearly ten years since they were in Sanxing Elementary School and Yongji Junior High School. Their relationship and understanding are like blood thicker than water. Now, as they are about to go their separate ways in college, it is inevitable that there will be some reluctance. However, in the last summer vacation of high school, they joined Shengsheng Fire and eventually won the championship in the Central District and the final. They not only won the league but also secured the gold medal for Shengsheng Fire for two consecutive years, marking a perfect end to their high school career.

Please continue reading- This year, they won the league championship for two consecutive years. Chen Hao said: "Last year, I mainly played off the ball, but this year as a senior, I have to take on more responsibility. Actually, I didn't even think about winning the championship at first, so there was no pressure on us. It's possible that because we had no fear, we performed better. As for setbacks, it's just dealing with the busy schedule of college entrance exams, and there's very little time for actual practice. My physical fitness is my weakness, so I need to adjust during the game."

Please continue reading- Joining Shengsheng Fire, they said: "Being part of this big family, we feel very free. Plus, our teammates are all talented players from different schools, so it's refreshing to blend in with them. It's more like an exchange than a competition."

- Faced with the choice of university, Wang Zhonghan said: "I've always planned to study abroad, and I chose a university in Germany because most of them don't have tuition fees, so the cost won't be much higher than in Taiwan. The Technical University of Munich is also considered the best university in Germany, so I decided to study in the Management & Technology department."

Please continue reading- As for Chen Hao, he chose to study at Tsinghua University without specifying a major. He said: "By chance, I discovered this department at Tsinghua University, which not only satisfies my desire to explore various fields in my freshman year, but also allows me to choose a major that interests me in the future. It's perfect for someone like me who is still uncertain about what to choose."

- After the end of the TGF World Fire Cup, the two will begin a new journey, and they also hope that their junior teammates will play freely, give their all, and have no regrets as their ultimate goal. In the end, they also send warm and slightly joking wishes to each other. It's not goodbye, it's see you next time. They wish both players to continue to shine in their respective fields and have the chance to reunite at the TGF World Fire Cup next year.
