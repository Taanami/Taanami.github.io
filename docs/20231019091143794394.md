 Enhancing the depth of the team: The benefits Kelly Oubre Jr. can bring to Philadelphia

At this moment, the lineup for the Philadelphia 76ers for their opening game against the Bucks on October 26 is basically set. Of course, things may change, perhaps the James Harden trade will eventually go through, or maybe a player will be waived, sparking the interest of the Sixers.

Continue reading to learn about Kelly Oubre Jr., the experienced wing player who was signed by Philadelphia this summer. Although this signing may have caused some fans to question or express dissatisfaction, signing Oubre Jr. to a veteran minimum contract is actually a great addition to the wing rotation for the team.

In fact, the players on the Sixers' roster are all very talented. They not only have the reigning MVP Joel Embiid, but also one of the most charismatic young stars in the NBA, Tyrese Maxey.

Deâ€™Anthony Melton has returned after an impressive first season with the Sixers, while Paul Reed has returned with a new contract and has the opportunity to play a new role under Nick Nurse. However, behind this lineup, there are also many question marks.

Tobias Harris and P.J. Tucker are the starting forwards for next season, and whoever you call the small forward or power forward is fine. Behind them, the true backup wings are Oubre Jr., Danuel House Jr., Furkan Korkmaz, and Danny Green, making the competition within the team fierce.

However, among this group, Oubre is clearly the most talented and has a better age and NBA experience.

Let's first point out his biggest flaw - efficiency. Throughout his NBA career, his true shooting percentage has been quite inconsistent. If we want to find a reason to be optimistic, perhaps it is that his true shooting percentage has improved every year, reaching 53.4% last season.

At the same time, for a player like him, his turnover numbers are a bit high. In his NBA career, his average turnovers (1.1) are more than his assists (1.0). In other words, when Oubre gets the ball, there is a good chance that it will leave him. This is not necessarily the worst thing, for those who are tired of seeing Harris or Tucker or any other player hesitate to take a shot when open, having Oubre on the team means not having to worry about that. Having a scoring type player on the bench who can create his own opportunities to substitute for Embiid or Maxey is definitely a good thing. As a highly anticipated lottery pick, Oubre's performance in the NBA has not lived up to expectations, but his potential still gives people hope. He stands at 198cm tall, with a wingspan of an impressive 220cm, and with his athleticism, he is still an attractive wing player. Photo credit: Getty Images

In addition, he has defensive potential, but effort can be an issue. It is worth noting that Oubre is already 27 years old this year, just coming off a season where he averaged over 20 points per game. The best he could get was a veteran minimum contract with the Sixers, which is clearly a crossroad in his career. He is now embarking on a path that we have seen many other players take. When you have the ability but cannot play for a championship-contending team in the league, the best bet you can make is to prove yourself and hope to earn a bigger contract in the future. The most successful example of this strategy is probably Bobby Portis. Portis was selected in the first round by the Bulls in the 2015 draft and had obvious talent.

Although Portis has achieved some success, he was not a highly sought-after player when he played for the Wizards and the Knicks. Therefore, it was surprising when he signed with the Bucks in 2020. However, what deserves recognition is that Portis played an important role off the bench for the Bucks and was one of the contributors to their championship that season.

Portis eventually signed a 4-year, $48.5 million contract with the Bucks, which is clearly a successful turnaround story and shows that this kind of story of rising from the bottom is not unprecedented.

Oubre and his agent, Torrel Harris, also understand that the Sixers will have enough salary cap space next season and will have Oubre's bird rights, giving them a great chance to re-sign him if things go well.

In short, signing a talented and peak-aged player like Oubre to a veteran minimum contract just a few weeks before training camp begins is undoubtedly a good thing for the Sixers from a basketball perspective.

Because there is basically no risk, just like signing Patrick Beverley, Mo Bamba, and Danny Green, if Oubre or any of them perform poorly, they can simply not let them play and let them go in the offseason (or even earlier).

As the opening game approaches, Harden's situation is like a disaster, overshadowing everything the Sixers are doing. However, signing a player like Oubre is a wise move from a basketball perspective with almost no drawbacks.
