Tatum was surprised by Lillard potentially joining the Bucks. Photo/ReutersAs the NBA media day events have been taking place recently, Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum expressed his surprise to Bleacher Report journalist Chris Haynes about the news of the Milwaukee Bucks potentially acquiring Damian Lillard through a trade.

"I was very surprised," Tatum said. "Even though all summer everyone was talking about the trade rumors surrounding Damian (Lillard), I never saw Milwaukee mentioned in any of them. I had never heard that they were interested in Damian, so when I opened my phone and saw the news, I was definitely shocked."

"They will have a super talented team, that's for sure. They have two of the best players in the league who are in their prime," he continued. "It will be tough to go up against them, but it will also be fun, so I'm looking forward to the new season. There are a lot of great teams in the league, so there will definitely be some exciting games in the upcoming season." Tatum said.

Tatum's surprise at the potential Lillard trade to the Bucks shows the decisiveness and determination of the Bucks management. Although the trade ultimately did not happen, the Bucks' interest in Lillard also proves his value and influence in the league. For the Bucks, acquiring Lillard would have been a highly valuable trade, and it would have been a huge bonus for a team that already has two All-Star players.
