  Unpredictable Off-Season for the Warriors: Season Outlook

The Warriors had a disappointing season, only making it to the second round with their sights set on the championship. The team's chemistry, injury issues, and even Wiggins' personal problems, to some extent, affected their cohesion.

The Warriors had a tumultuous off-season, starting with trading Jordan Poole, who had been with the team for four years, for Chris Paul, a player in the same position. The next day, they drafted guard Brandin Podziemski from Santa Clara with their first-round pick and also signed Cory Joseph and Dario Saric in free agency. Looking at the roster, it may seem like the team's strength hasn't changed much. However, as long as the three core players perform at their normal levels and maximize Chris Paul's abilities, the team can still remain competitive.

The first issue that Steve Kerr should address is how to manage the rotation of the guards. Should CP3 start or come off the bench? If CP3 accepts a bench role, it would undoubtedly be the best approach. If he starts alongside Curry, the defense of the starting backcourt would be a major weakness.

Furthermore, the Warriors' frontcourt lacks height, with Kevon Looney, who stands at 206 cm, already not being tall enough. If Green is moved to the small-ball center position, rebounding will be a challenge, and the team will lose its ability to control the paint. Although Kerr has used a "Death Lineup" consisting of Curry, Poole, Thompson, Wiggins, and Green in the past playoffs, creating ample spacing, there is a minimal chance of grabbing offensive rebounds when their shooting is off. Additionally, consistently asking players to play smaller roles can also drain their energy. To maximize CP3's value, it is better to have him play with the second unit. Curry and Green both need the ball to initiate the offense, and CP3's ball-handling responsibilities would be significantly reduced. Although his usage rate has been declining, it is not a good idea to have him play as a catch-and-shoot player or to have him play off the ball extensively.

In other words, his ball-handling percentage would increase if he played with the second unit. Another issue is CP3's playstyle, which relies heavily on pick-and-roll (P&R) plays. The Warriors' system emphasizes setting screens and off-ball movement, so there might be a need for time to adjust.

However, I disagree with this notion. In recent years, Curry and Draymond have also started to utilize more high pick-and-roll plays to create more space for Curry to attack and take pull-up shots. I believe Paul can still play the P&R game with the Warriors, and Kuminga might benefit from it as well.

The key factor will be Chris Paul's adaptation speed. Although Chris Paul's effectiveness in pick-and-roll plays has declined, his elite skills in this area can still create good scoring opportunities for himself. Considering the success of Paul and Ayton's pick-and-roll in the Suns, as long as Kuminga improves his screening quality, I have confidence that Kuminga can be properly utilized. Setting aside the perceived waste of Chris Paul's $30 million salary as a bench player, I believe it is not a bad decision. For now, the focus should be on finding ways to help the team and improve the lack of firepower in the second unit.

I believe CP3 will understand this. Instead of chasing elusive consecutive starting records, it would be better to increase his chances of winning a championship ring in his career.

Last season, the Warriors had Donte DiVincenzo, who had a high conversion rate from beyond the arc, to maintain a decent outside shooting presence. Therefore, I hope Brandin Podziemski, who has been drafted, can step up as a reliable shooter off the bench, with a strong focus on improving his defense.

Podziemski displayed exceptional shooting skills from beyond the arc during his sophomore season at Santa Clara, shooting 43.8% and contributing 2.5 three-pointers per game. Although the level of competition in Santa Clara's conference might not be the highest, it is still quite impressive for the team's leading scorer to achieve such a high shooting percentage.

What's more important is that his shooting is not limited to catch-and-shoot situations. He has shown the ability to navigate screens and move without the ball, making him a valuable shooter when paired with Green and Looney, who excel at setting screens. In addition, when his shooting is off, Podziemski can use his playmaking abilities to create opportunities for his teammates.

I have high hopes that he can provide a boost to the bench scoring, and he should have no problem playing around 6-8 minutes per game. He is fully capable of executing tactics such as Split Action and Flare Screen.

GPII's role is also crucial in compensating for the poor defense in the backcourt. The regular-season rotation in the backcourt should look like this: starting lineup - Curry + Thompson, bench - CP3 + Podz + GPII (primarily playing the small forward position but also contributing to backcourt defense). The team has also lost a significant amount of points due to turnovers, with an average of 16.3 turnovers per game, which is the highest in the league. The team has given away too many easy transition opportunities to opponents, making it challenging to prevent fast-break points. The Warriors have essentially gifted their opponents with a considerable amount of points through turnovers, and these two statistics are the main reasons for their turnovers.
