  Chinese Men's Basketball: The Difficulty in Finding Replacements for Zeng Xiangjun and Li Dewei

The roster for the Chinese Men's Basketball team in the upcoming Asian Games includes many talented local players in the frontcourt. However, based on their performance in the Jones Cup, it seems that they have yet to find suitable candidates to replace the starting lineup. With the confirmation that Chen Yingjun will not be able to play in the Asian Games, Zeng Wendong has been added to the roster. The question remains whether Li Dewei, who has shown good organization skills, and Zeng Xiangjun, who is more agile in offense and defense, will lose the opportunity to take charge in the frontcourt. Let's analyze this statement further. Please continue reading.

Looking at the evolution of the tactics in the Jones Cup, Li Dewei and Zeng Xiangjun have intersecting roles. In addition to naturalized player Andray Blatche becoming a key player in the frontcourt, there are also six local players on the team. Li Dewei, Zeng Xiangjun, and Chen Guanquan are the main substitutes, while Zhou Boxun, Zeng Wendong, and Wang Haoji serve as backup options, strengthening the team's offense and defense in the paint.

However, despite averaging 38 rebounds per game, with Blatche contributing 10.5 rebounds, the three main local players only average 7.9 rebounds, which is not a significant advantage over their opponents. The team also faces the problem of lacking guards, which has affected their ball organization and the selection of frontcourt players. Li Dewei has been a regular starter in the previous games, providing ball handling skills in the frontcourt to relieve the pressure on Lin Tingqian, who is filling in as the point guard. Li Dewei often operates from the high post or top of the key, using hand-offs and screens, and focusing on the "Chicago Action" tactics, showcasing his strengths among the frontcourt players.

Looking at the statistics, Li Dewei has performed well in terms of assists and rebounds against the Philippines and Japan. Although he lacks agility, his height and physicality make him a solid defensive presence in the paint, contributing 1.4 blocks per game. However, he has been limited to a maximum of 5 points in a single game, which shows that he has been restricted in his role as the team's tactics have changed. This led to him being placed on the bench. The key turning point was the game against Qatar, where Lin Tingqian and Blatche's pick-and-roll combination allowed Coach Sonny Sablan to find a new approach, changing the emphasis on high post ball handling and attempting to involve the power forward in the offense.

Although Li Dewei can shoot from outside, his shooting speed is not fast enough. He can play low-post offense, but lacks the skills and agility to outmaneuver opponents. His efficiency in following up on rebounds is not good, and his offensive contributions come mainly from second-chance points and offensive rebounds. His recent negative plus-minus values indicate a decline in his effectiveness on the court, and his role has become somewhat unclear.

Now let's talk about a small incident in the Jones Cup. Zeng Xiangjun expressed his opinion on social media, indicating that he felt he had limited playing time. Although he didn't have many opportunities in the previous games, his statistics were not bad, and he efficiently completed his tasks. His performance was consistent with the team's overall performance. As a result, he became the preferred option in the lineup as Coach Lin Tingqian focused more on attacking from the power forward position. Zeng Xiangjun's quick shooting, agility, and impact made him an important part of the team. He made two three-pointers against the United Arab Emirates and the United States, and scored in double digits in the last four games. He had a plus-minus value of 33 against South Korea, which expanded the team's offensive options and increased their fast break opportunities.

Zeng Xiangjun's advantage in the local frontcourt lies in his agility. With a height of 205cm and a weight of 95kg, he has a well-proportioned physique that allows him to play as a stretch big in a 5-out system or as part of a small-ball lineup. He has good awareness in following up on plays and has offensive skills from mid-range, making him more in line with the modern basketball trend in terms of offense and defense. Unless there are major changes in the coaching staff in the short term, Zeng Xiangjun will definitely be the preferred choice in the lineup.

However, his average of 0.9 assists and 0.7 blocks per game shows that he is primarily focused on finishing plays on offense. Despite his height, he needs to improve his court vision and passing skills. He still needs to develop his awareness in pick-and-roll situations to give the coach more options.

From the above analysis, it is clear that Zeng Xiangjun and Li Dewei, the main local frontcourt players, have different playing styles. Zeng Xiangjun excels in defense and playmaking, while Li Dewei is skilled in offense and speed. They both bring different offensive and defensive styles to the Chinese team. Their playing time in the Jones Cup alternated, not based on their performance, but rather on the team's tactics and ball-dominant approach. However, it is certain that they will be the main forces in the Asian Games, along with the naturalized players.

Under normal circumstances, with the presence of the top three CBA players and quality local point guards in the lineup, it would be clear who should start and who should be the backups. However, injuries have caused changes in the lineup, making this question unpredictable. With Chen Yingjun's withdrawal from the Asian Games and Wu Yongsheng being added as a replacement, it is clear that there is a void in the point guard position. Lin Tingqian still has to fill in as the starting point guard, and Zeng Wendong's inclusion in the roster leaves no doubt about the choice of local frontcourt players. It is almost certain that apart from Zeng Xiangjun, the other frontcourt players will have limited playing time. Even though Zeng Wendong is already 39 years old, his efficient playing style, basketball IQ, and playmaking skills are qualities that the team needs to win games. Unless other players in different positions are performing exceptionally well, Zeng Wendong will likely get around 20 minutes of playing time. As for this roster change, it is disappointing for the writer, as it sacrifices the future for the sake of pursuing medals.
