  Review of the Top 2022 Keywords in May: Taiwan Star Major Network Outage, NAC Cough Medicine Rumor Becomes a Hot Search

Approaching the end of 2022, let's review the year through the daily top search keywords on Google. This article looks back at the things that garnered attention in May 2022. Compared to the previous months, May did not have any events with daily searches exceeding one million. The highest search volume was on May 25th for "uniform invoice," which had over 500,000 searches.

The term "uniform invoice" became a popular keyword every two months when people checked it for prize-winning purposes.

After the outbreak of the Omicron variant in Taiwan in April, the daily number of confirmed cases continued to rise in May, reaching over 80,000 daily cases by the end of the month.

To understand related diagnoses and vaccination information, keywords related to the pandemic were still among the top searches for the month. These included "high-end," "fourth dose," "school closure criteria," "vaccination in Tainan," "PCR clinic" (correctly written as PCR in all caps, but presented as Pcr in the data), and "NAC cough medicine" (rumored to reduce mortality rate).

The following image shows the changes in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan and the United States from January to May 2022. There were three days when the search volume exceeded 200,000. On May 1st, the start of income tax filing made "tax filing" the most popular search term of the day. On May 9th, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake occurred off the coast of Hualien, causing tremors of intensity 1-3 in the northern region and making "earthquake" the most popular search term.

On the following day, May 10th, Taiwan Star experienced a major network outage across the country due to a power outage in the area where their data center was located. In addition, cases of monkeypox, which had previously only been prevalent in Africa, started to be reported in European and American countries, with over 100 cases recorded by the end of the month. The image below shows the global monkeypox situation as of May 23rd.

In terms of movies, "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" and "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2" were released, becoming popular search topics.

In the sports realm, it was the NBA playoffs season, so information about related teams and matchups became popular searches. The hot keywords included "Warriors," "Grizzlies vs. Warriors," "Heat vs. Celtics," and "Warriors vs. Grizzlies." In the field of education, both Taipei University and Huaxia University made headlines with news of suspensions and admissions freezes.

Updates on well-known figures continued to attract public attention. These included the marriage of a celebrity known as "Thin Man," Kim Tae-ri winning the Best Actress Award at the Baeksang Arts Awards, the birth of Jay Chou and Hannah Quinlivan's third child, the breakup between Dee Hsu and Mike Ho, the rapid breakup of Yang Xiuhui and Bai Yun, Gino Jiang You being sentenced for sexual assault during a live stream, Elva Hsiao's performance of her hit song on a Chinese variety show going viral again, Soda Green reclaiming their trademark rights, Kuang Yanjun's controversial post "So many children just leave like this," the live-streamed courtroom battle between Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard, Xu Qiaoxin being exposed for illegally pressuring a traffic police officer to not issue a ticket, and Tai Tzu-ying winning the BWF World Tour Super 1000 championship this season.

In terms of finance and economics, two events became hot searches: the collapse and drastic decline of Luna Coin by 99% and the record-high cash dividend payment of Cathay Sustainable High Dividend ETF (00878). There was also an interesting keyword this month, "Askew," which means "crooked" or "tilted" in English. On May 2nd, it became a hot search keyword because someone discovered that when searching for "Askew" on Google, the entire search results page would appear tilted.
