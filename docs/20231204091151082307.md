  2023 TGF Fire Safety Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview - Zhiping High School

Zhiping High School has been participating in the TGF Fire Safety Cup since 2021, when they ended their journey in the Northern Division preliminary round. After the cancellation of the tournament in 2022 due to the pandemic, they once again challenged and won the Northern Division and National Finals in the Single School Group this year. Facing tough opponents from all over the country, Zhiping High School overcame all obstacles and even encountered a bottleneck during the final match, but successfully adjusted and found their rhythm on the third day. They met Kaohsiung Industrial Vocational High School in the championship match, completing a sweet revenge and bringing the National Single School Group championship back to the Northern Division for the first time since 2018! Please continue reading below.

Zhiping High School already had a top-level team, but due to the system, they were unable to form a team of regular students to participate in the secondary league. However, these basketball enthusiasts continue to work hard for their passion. The team was established about 5 years ago and this year's players consisted of seven first-year students and five second-year students. Many of them were participating in the TGF Fire Safety Cup for the first time, but this also allowed them to experience a completely different style of basketball and atmosphere.

When asked about the most memorable matches in the Northern Division preliminary round and National Finals, 16-year-old Yú Mèngxún said, "In the preliminary round, we had a chance to secure a spot in the top four, but due to our own mistakes, we ended up losing. However, we were given a second chance in the finals against Kaohsiung Industrial Vocational High School. We learned from our previous mistakes and improved our three-point shooting. The most crucial change was the coach's adjustment in defense. With these changes, we were able to secure the victory and successfully avenge our previous loss."

However, Zhiping High School faced some challenges when they first arrived at the tournament venue. The players admitted that they were too relaxed in the first two games of the National Finals, which led to a difficult win in the first game and a loss in the second game due to too many mistakes. From the third game onwards, they gradually improved and became more aggressive on defense. During the semifinals, they played according to their expectations and even discussed the problems and adjustments needed after each game. With everyone pointing out each other's mistakes and making timely adjustments, as well as their growing team cohesion, they were able to bring home the championship.

In addition, Chén Lìyǔ, who won the FMVP award in the championship game, impressed everyone with his outstanding performance, helping the team with his offensive firepower. Yú Mèngxún, who won the FMVP award in the preliminary round, also won the Assist King award in the finals, while Zhāng Ēnqí won the Steal King award, making them the biggest winners in the Single School Group. The chemistry between these three players was crucial in Zhiping High School's championship victory.

The coach who led the team to victory, Huáng Défēng, also received the Best Coach award from the tournament. When asked about his thoughts and feelings this year, he said, "I am grateful to the TGF Fire Safety Cup for providing such a great stage for these young players to showcase and prove themselves. We didn't expect to win the championship this year, especially since our physical condition and experience were not as good as last year. However, the trust, unity, and never-give-up attitude among the players were the most touching and proud moments for me and Coach Wú Zhèngxian. I hope they can pass on this energy to the younger players and continue to improve." Lastly, Zhiping High School would like to thank the TGF Fire Safety Cup for providing this platform for their players to shine, and they also want to give a special thanks to the school's chairman and the team's manager for taking good care of the athletes and allowing them to focus on their training without any worries, and they hope to defend their championship title next year.
