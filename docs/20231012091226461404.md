  Lion City Lions, Taishin Warlords, and Lin Ping-Sheng Unable to Reach Consensus, Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA) States No Further Negotiations 

Regarding the contract dispute involving Lion City Lions, Taishin Warlords, and Lin Ping-Sheng, the CTBA held its first mediation meeting on September 4th. After recent discussions within both parties, a consensus could not be reached. Therefore, out of respect for the wishes of the teams involved, the CTBA will no longer assist in further mediation. In regards to this case, the CTBA will respect and understand any legal actions taken by the teams moving forward.

The CTBA will continue to establish and improve relevant systems within the domestic basketball industry in order to create a healthier basketball environment. Starting from January 1st, 2024, the CTBA plans to implement the "Sports Agent System" with the goal of providing protection and fair transactions for the domestic basketball environment, teams, and players, so as to prevent contract disputes from affecting the rights and interests of players and teams.
