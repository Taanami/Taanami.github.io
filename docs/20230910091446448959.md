  Who is the Mizuno Wave Rider 27 or 26 Shoes that Dingzi shared?

When someone asks, "I want to start running, does Mizuno have any recommended shoe models? I just started running, and my goal is to complete a full marathon. Which Mizuno shoes are more suitable?" When I started seriously following a training schedule, are there any recommended Mizuno running shoes for daily training? The answer to all these questions is likely to be Mizuno Wave Rider without a doubt (laughs~). As the most classic (evergreen) running shoe from Mizuno, the Wave Rider series has always maintained a stable functionality, designed to provide shoes for beginner runners or daily training. It has a certain level of performance in cushioning, stability, durability, and comfort. Perhaps in various aspects such as weight and flexibility, it may not have the flagship specifications, but it is definitely a series of shoes that you don't have to worry about. Don't worry about the kind of shoes that you are used to wearing. What if they are discontinued? The Wave Rider series is the kind of series that you can continue to wear. If your Wave Rider 25 is worn out and you can't buy it anymore, you can seamlessly transition to the 26th generation, or the 27th generation is also good. You can continue to adapt without pain and become one of the biggest features of the Wave Rider series. Although there are not many updates between generations, they will definitely have stable functional outputs.

Mizuno Wave Rider 26 difference: Heel drop: 12mm (24mm at the front, 36mm at the back). Please continue reading for high visibility of Wave Rider 26 & 27. The two are almost identical in configuration, and the biggest difference is the last type. Rider 27 has two lasts, wide last and 2E extra wide last. However, compared to the previous generation, the wide last of the 27th generation is approximately between the D last and 2E of regular shoes, while the 2E extra wide last is similar to the regular 2E last. The last type of the 26th generation can be said to be a completely larger last compared to the 27th generation. The 2E extra wide last of the 26th generation is approximately equivalent to the regular 4E last, so when choosing the size of these two shoes, you need to be more careful. Another differe
