 The still hot Terrence Ross, who has yet to sign with any team in the free agency market, is perhaps being forgotten by the market due to the current market environment or ongoing trade rumors. In this article, we will briefly discuss Ross' career and recent performances to highlight why he is still worth signing for any team.

First, let's talk about Ross' potential as a young small forward. Ranked fifth among small forwards and thirtieth overall in the United States, Ross was considered a rising star in high school. He played for Jefferson High School in Portland, where he was selected as the 5A level Player of the Year and helped the team win the state championship alongside his teammate, Terrence Jones, who also went on to play in the NBA.

After becoming a local celebrity, Ross attended the University of Washington. In his first year, he didn't have much playing time, averaging only 17.4 minutes per game with 8.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 1 assist. This highlighted his lack of refinement in certain skills and the challenges he faced when transitioning to a higher level. However, it was encouraging to see Ross shooting 35.2% from beyond the arc, indicating his potential as a shooter in the future.

In his sophomore year, Ross transformed into a key player for the team. Compared to the previous year when he mainly came off the bench, Ross started every game and saw his playing time increase to an average of 31.1 minutes. He also doubled his scoring, averaging 16.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 1.4 assists. While his assist numbers didn't see much improvement, his immediate impact as a shooter and his exceptional athleticism kept him in the lottery range for the NBA draft. Eventually, Ross decided to forgo his remaining college eligibility and enter the 2012 NBA draft. Despite his underwhelming performance in his freshman year, his inclusion in the All-Pac-12 First Team, shooting 37.1% from beyond the arc, and ranking sixth in the conference in scoring proved his potential as a shooter. Combined with his fearless mentality in big games and his explosive scoring ability, which earned him the nickname "The Human Torch," Ross was selected as the eighth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors.

"When I ask other guys who work out here, they say it's by far the best city in the league right now," Ross said. "It's real diverse, a lot of people are friendly, I just love it out here."

However, Ross' career did not live up to expectations. While he was considered a valuable bench player, his performance fell short of what was expected from an eighth overall pick. One reason was the issue of his position. With DeMar DeRozan occupying the starting position, Ross struggled to find his role on the team. Even when playing as a small forward, his size and subpar defense made the team vulnerable on defense.

Another issue was Ross' playing style. Fans and the team hoped that as an athletic swingman selected in the lottery, Ross would become a two-way star. However, he failed to fully utilize his athleticism and his defensive contributions were not impressive. On offense, he often settled for outside shots and, due to his confidence in his abilities, opted for difficult shots instead of taking simpler options. Rather than being a star wing player, he became more of an outside shooting specialist. Consequently, the Raptors eventually traded him to the Orlando Magic. It's worth noting that Ross won the Slam Dunk Contest in 2013, showcasing his exceptional athleticism.

After joining the Magic, Ross no longer carried the same expectations of a young prospect. He became a relied-upon mid-tier player on the team. Although he couldn't secure a starting role, his simple and effective playing style, combined with the Magic's lack of outside shooting, solidified his position on the team. He averaged 26.1 minutes per game over his seven years with the Magic, demonstrating his importance to the team.

His familiar high-flying dunks were still present, and although his shooting from beyond the arc had some ups and downs, his ability to take decisive shots and handle pressure made him stand out on the team. Alongside Ross, the Magic made consecutive playoff appearances after a long drought, which speaks to his significant contributions to the team.
