Imagining the Future of the Timberwolves if the Gobert Trade Had Never Happened

When the game No Man's Sky was released, it was hailed as a glimpse into the future. The game boasted extreme features generated by algorithms and 180 billion explorable planets, a number too vast to comprehend. The game's design centered around navigating and surviving on these planets.

However, this was not a new concept, as exploration games have been around for a long time, with the earliest form appearing in the 1979 text game Adventure. This genre evolved into a more recognizable form in the 1980s with games like Mystery House, which featured graphical elements, although they were pixelated on the screen.

But despite its promise, the game's release ended in a spectacular failure. The developers of No Man's Sky, Hello Games, failed to realize that even with 180 billion planets, if none of them were worth investing in, the quantity became meaningless. The game lacked elements that could attract players, so there was no reason for them to spend time playing. In fact, there always needs to be something to keep people going until something is fully realized.

This is why the previous Gobert trade and the way the Timberwolves handled it was so confusing. Instead of the new rookie Walker Kessler, who was expected to be Karl-Anthony Towns' partner before Gobert arrived, the Timberwolves gave up at least five draft picks. This leads to the question, what would have happened if they had kept Kessler and tried to pair Towns with a traditional big man? Of course, the biggest issue would be Towns' health, but at least Naz Reid would have had a chance to shine. The next question would be whether Reid would have started in Towns' absence, or if Kessler, who was not traded for Gobert, would have started, just like the Timberwolves did in the 40 games following Towns' injury last season. However, these are all just good questions now, as we can no longer imagine the outcome.

In a different perspective, the Timberwolves were desperate for a point guard last season.

D'Angelo Russell was occasionally injured and traded, Jordan McLaughlin was placed on the injured reserve due to a calf strain, and Austin Rivers barely made the cut to avoid being cut.

During this time of point guard shortage, the Timberwolves' rookie Wendell Moore Jr. was benched and never given a chance until his debut as a starter, when the answer became clear. To put it simply, Moore didn't deserve playing time on a team that needed a point guard.

Moore's debut was exciting, but it was short-lived. After the Gobert trade, Towns and Gobert's initial pairing seemed like a disaster, so it's not an exaggeration to say that the same could have happened with Kessler.

Although comparing Moore and Keesler, two rookies, is absurd, the comparison of situations and opportunity costs for the Timberwolves is not.

We are uncertain if the Timberwolves' management believed that rookie players could contribute in their rookie season, but Leonard Miller, selected this year, seems to have a chance to play and maintain a stable playing time. However, with players like Towns, Gobert, Kyle Anderson, and Naz Reid rotating at the 4 and 5 positions, it seems unlikely that he will have many opportunities unless there are major injuries.

In a parallel universe, Kessler could have been an outstanding young player and played an important role as the Timberwolves' center, just like he did on the Jazz.

However, it's also possible that he would have spent the whole season in Iowa (Timberwolves' development league) while the Timberwolves missed the playoffs due to the absence of Gobert and declining performances from players like Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt. In another possible scenario, what would happen in the end? For example, would Towns be traded, and the Timberwolves would build their team around Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, and Kessler? Would the Timberwolves follow through with their actual offseason moves, simply rebuilding the team without learning anything from their intense first-round series against eventual champions, the Denver Nuggets?

In another possible scenario, how would Kessler's development have gone? How many opportunities would he have for backup, rest, and starting? Would he become a league-level defender in a short period, like he did in the past two seasons? Or would he become an excellent traditional big man, like he did in college? In a parallel universe, we may one day see the sequel to this trade, but for now, we can only speculate. Regardless, this imagination takes place in a parallel universe, and all we can do is continue to follow the Timberwolves and hope for their success in the future.
