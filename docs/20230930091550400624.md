  Cross-League Basketball Tournament: University Team Wins SBL Champions Taiwan Bank with a Dominant Performance

September 17, 2023 - In a report by United Daily News, the Cross-League Basketball Tournament organized by the Chinese Basketball Association featured university teams for the first time. Political University's men's basketball team, who had previously won three consecutive championships in the UBA Open Men's Division, made their debut and secured a convincing victory over the SBL former champions, Taiwan Bank, with a 21-point lead. Led by their star guard You Aizhe, who contributed 20 points, 9 assists, and 8 rebounds, Political University clinched an 87-76 victory.

Last year marked the inaugural edition of the Cross-League Basketball Tournament, and this year's event marked its second edition. The participating teams included SBL's Taiwan Bank, Taiwan Beer, and Changhua Bank, as well as PLG's Dreamers Youth Team and Yulon Luxgen Dinos, and T1 Alliance's new team, Taipei Taishin Warriors. Political University became the first university team to be invited to participate. Despite facing formidable opponents, Political University showcased their strength by taking a 15-12 lead in their opening game against Taiwan Bank, after having played exhibition games in the United States, Beijing, Japan, and the Philippines. Last year's SBL champions, Taiwan Bank, managed to level the score to 15-15 in the second quarter with Pan Xiangwei's three-pointer. However, Political University quickly regained the lead with a timeout called by You Aizhe, who scored 8 points in a row, along with a buzzer-beating shot, allowing Political University to maintain a 41-37 advantage at halftime.

In the third quarter, Political University's Zhuang Zhaosheng and Wu Zhikai hit consecutive three-pointers, leading an 8-0 run to extend their lead to 49-37. Left-handed foreign player Popoka made two free throws, widening the gap to 51-37. Taiwan Bank's Chen Youxu ended the drought with a basket after 7 minutes and 10 seconds, but Political University continued their fast-break attacks, pushing their lead to 61-43. Lin Zihao's three-pointer further increased the margin to 21 points. Political University dominated the third quarter with a 25-8 run, entering the fourth quarter with a comfortable 66-45 lead. Although Taiwan Bank's Jian Jiawei and Lin Zheting's consecutive three-pointers momentarily narrowed the gap to 8 points and Political University's foreign player Popoka fouled out early, Political University's Wu Zhikai and foreign player Mustafa responded with scoring runs, restoring their double-digit advantage. In the end, Political University secured their first victory with a final score of 87-76. Four players from Political University scored in double figures, with Song Xinhao leading the team with 22 points, followed by You Aizhe with 20 points, 9 assists, and 8 rebounds, Lin Zihao with 13 points, and Popoka with 11 points and 15 rebounds. Chen Youxu was the top scorer for Taiwan Bank with 17 points.
