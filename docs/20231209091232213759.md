  NBA Can Still Dominate the League Without Going to Miami, LeBron May Have Fewer Rings

LeBron James caused a huge stir in the league when he left Cleveland to join Miami, starting a new trend in the league. Yesterday, LeBron was interviewed by local reporters in Miami and was asked about the "Heat Culture" on the city edition jerseys of the Miami Heat this year. LeBron had previously played for the Heat and won two championships, two regular season MVPs and two Finals MVPs, so he was able to answer these questions with ease. He mentioned that his four years in Miami were a great time and he learned a lot, playing under coach Spoelstra and alongside players like Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Udonis Haslem.

LeBron also talked about how his experience in Miami was the best, but regardless of whether he was there or not, he would always push himself to reach his limits and have the legendary career he has now.

LeBron said, "I feel like, whether I came here or not, I would still maintain this level. Don't get me wrong: my four years here were amazing. I loved everything about it, I loved this team, this team is top-notch, one of the best in the world." "But for my own career, no matter where I am, I will continue to be myself because I know how much I have put into the game and how hard I work to be as great as possible. But what I learned here was the best, that's for sure." After this article started circulating online, netizens began discussing the topic fervently. Today, on a day without a game, LeBron replied to this discussion topic, saying, "That's for sure, I'll still be (the player dominating this league), I am CHOSEN! (the chosen one), nothing will change that. Maybe there will be fewer rings, but I will still dominate from the moment I entered the league until the end of my career."
