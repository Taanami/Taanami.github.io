 This year, there have been some changes in the NBA, such as many teams changing their court floors to more dazzling colors and designs (NBA rainbow court). As human beings, we tend to get tired of the same old things, and the NBA is no exception. In order to please the fans, the switch in hardware design is also to stimulate their visual senses and avoid the lack of interest that comes with watching the same thing for years. Please continue reading as we shift the focus back to the players' performances on the court, which is what fans love to see. Each game has its own highlights, whether it's a dunk, an incredible long-range shot, a dazzling dribble, or a spectacular block. These moments are often made into short videos by the NBA or passionate fans and shared on social media.

Draymond Green, the master of basketball fighting, has been causing quite a stir recently. But his potential on the basketball court goes beyond that. Please continue reading as we discuss Green's controversial actions and how he constantly pushes the boundaries of what is possible on the court, attracting a lot of attention. Aside from his passionate plays, Green is often seen arguing with referees and getting ejected from the game.

In a recent game between the Warriors and the Timberwolves, a confrontation broke out between players after Warriors' Klay Thompson was pulled by an opponent at mid-court. Green, in a swift and unexpected move, used a wrestling move called a chokehold on Rudy Gobert, which completely changed the tone of the game.

After the incident, Green, along with two other players, was ejected from the game. Due to Green's past reputation, the NBA held a meeting and decided to increase his punishment. He was suspended for 5 games and fined $769,704 (approximately 24.64 million NT dollars) in lost salary.

Many fans were left confused after seeing the footage and wondered what could have happened for Green to react in such a way.

Some people even made memes and jokes about Green's out-of-control behavior, making NBA fans chuckle.

Could it be that Green's recent violent actions on the court are a sign of his shift towards a different career path? Including the punch he threw at Poole in a previous game, Green has a reputation for being a player who often loses control and gets carried away. This is also how most people perceive him. However, on the other hand, Green's unpredictable behavior has also brought a different kind of attention to the game, sometimes even making it more interesting. For example, Shaquille O'Neal imitating Green's chokehold on Charles Barkley on a show, or the recent memes circulating online, are evidence of this. Just like life, we try to control all the variables and hope to move forward smoothly. But many facts and the way society works don't always go as planned, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict or the recent Israel-Palestine conflict. We all hope for peace, but sometimes unfortunate things happen. While Green may have emotional management issues, it has also become a defining characteristic and a memorable aspect of his career. Some sports commentators have even said that if you go to a Warriors game, besides wanting to see the Splash Brothers' incredible three-point shots, you also want to see Draymond Green get into a fight.

Following the logic of capitalism, Green's image as a physical player, both on and off the court, and his role as a podcaster, may have slowly paved the way for new career opportunities. Maybe one day, we will see Green step into the ring as a fighter, and it won't be surprising or out of place at all, but rather something we might even look forward to. C'est la vie.
