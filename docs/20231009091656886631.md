 NBA Tatum's training video attracts former teammate Grant Williams to comment, "Just add more dunks like this." 

Grant Williams, who was traded from the Celtics to the Mavericks this summer, has maintained a good relationship with his former teammates. Throughout the summer, they have often teased each other on social media. A few days ago, the Celtics released a video of Jayson Tatum training, which prompted a response from Grant Williams. Grant Williams commented, "Is that all? Add more dunks @jaytatum0" (accompanied by an eye-rolling emoji). Previously, when Williams joined the Mavericks, Tatum had commented below, "You definitely can't be that strong @grantwill2." Williams replied, "You'll be like me one day, I believe in you." 

In addition, Marcus Smart also left this summer, and Jaylen Brown recently posted a farewell message to Smart on IG. Current teammate Jaren Jackson Jr replied below, "Now he's my brother," and Brown responded again, "Haha, they don't play with you guys anymore."
