  NBALonzoBall personally confirms he will miss the new season and reveals optimistic postoperative recovery situation

Today, Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball talked about his injury issues on Trae Young's podcast. He stated that he will once again be absent for the entire 2023-24 season.

"I just had a major surgery, and I hope this is the last surgery I have to undergo," Ball said on Young's podcast, "From the Point." "It's been a long process. I've already ruled out the next season. When I first got injured, we didn't really know the specific injury. I saw different doctors and specialists, and my condition was up and down. It was really tough for me because I didn't know what the next day would be like."

"At least now, I've had the surgery, and we have a plan going forward. We've been following the plan, and I'm on the right track," Ball added. Chicago Bulls executive vice president of basketball operations, Arturas Karnisovas, stated in June that despite Ball's long absence, there is currently no consideration of giving up on him or extending his contract.

"Hopefully, everything goes smoothly," Ball said. "I'm just leaving everything in God's hands, doing my best, and accepting the outcome." Lonzo Ball, 25 years old, last played for the Chicago Bulls on January 14, 2022, against the Golden State Warriors.

Due to discomfort in his left knee, he left the game early and later revealed that he was dealing with a bone bruise and meniscus tear. Initially, it was expected that he would return at the start of the playoffs, but Ball's left knee continued to be painful, forcing him to restart the rehabilitation process, and the team decided to rest him for the remaining time this year. Throughout the strengthening program and daily training, Ball's pain did not improve, leading to his second surgery in September 2022. It was believed that after the second surgery, he would be able to resume on-court activities this year, but that did not happen.

Due to the inability to perform simple tasks like jumping and climbing stairs, Ball opted for cartilage transplant surgery on his left knee in March 2023, which is said to be the best option for his NBA career recovery.
