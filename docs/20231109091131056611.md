 202323 Season Analysis: New York Knicks Steady in the Face of Change

Introduction

Please continue reading below. Last season, the New York Knicks achieved a new level of success, making it to the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs for the first time since the 2012-13 season. Their performance has been well recognized and they have even been compared to a strong team. The biggest key to their success was their new leader, Jalen Brunson. Not only did he prove himself as a team leader, but also showed that leaving the Dallas Mavericks was the right decision and helped to bring the Knicks back together.

After three seasons, head coach Tom Thibodeau finally revamped the Knicks and found the formula for success.

Looking at the Knicks' moves this summer, they were not bad as they were able to retain most of their key players and also added some valuable bench players. The team's tactics for the upcoming season will surely be clearer than last season, but the question is how high can they elevate their game? This will be the biggest challenge for the Knicks in the new season.

Departed players:

Obi Toppin PF (Indiana Pacers)

Derrick Rose PG (Memphis Grizzlies)

The main team from last season is back and there were only minor adjustments made. The most significant additions were former college teammates of Brunson and Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo and point guard Ryan Arcidiacono.

Arcidiacono will fill in the role of backup point guard after the departure of Derrick Rose, while DiVincenzo brings both offense and defense to the team with his solid fundamentals. He has also been coming off the bench in the past few years to help his team, and with most of the core players still on the team, it shouldn't take long for him to fit in.

As head coach Tom Thibodeau said, "It's very valuable to accumulate experience with each teammate because you've been through a lot together and learned together. How we move forward as a team, one of the biggest advantages is that you already understand your teammates and know how the system works." The double core of Brunson and Randle will be the target of opposing teams' defense in the new season.

Last season, Brunson was the driving force for the Knicks' offense, averaging 24 points, 3.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 0.9 steals, with shooting percentages of 49.1%, 41.6%, and 82.9% for field goals, three-pointers, and free throws, respectively. He also elevated his game in the playoffs, averaging 27.8 points, 4.9 rebounds, 5.6 assists, and 1.5 steals. He is undoubtedly the Knicks' team leader and the point guard they have been searching for.

Although Brunson's defense has been criticized, his determination, drive, and leadership make up for it.

"I think my efficiency will be better in the new season," said Julius Randle, who just had ankle surgery in June. "I understand the game more, which allows me to be a more efficient player." Last season, Randle made changes to his game by shooting more three-pointers and reducing long-range two-pointers, resulting in improved shooting efficiency - 8.3 attempts and 34.3% for three-pointers, and 45.9% for overall field goals with an effective field goal percentage of 53.6%.

In the new season, it is expected that Randle will continue with the same strategy and, with Brunson leading the offense, help to share the scoring load and target the opponent's weaknesses. Rebounds are crucial in determining the outcome of the game, and this is especially true for the Knicks and Mitchell Robinson. Last season, the Knicks were a threat in terms of rebound protection and offensive rebounds. The main contributor to their offensive rebound rate was Robinson.

Although Robinson's presence in the paint may lead to opponents focusing more on defending the Knicks' offense, his dominance in offensive rebounding will continue to be a problem for the opposing team's tall towers. The fate of RJ Barrett, who had a contract extension of $120 million for four years, has been sealed as the cornerstone of the Knicks for the next few years, living up to his title of "savior" since being selected in the draft.

Barrett averaged 19.6 points, 5 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 0.4 steals last season with shooting percentages of 43.4%, 31%, and 74% for field goals, three-pointers, and free throws, respectively.

Although his performance was not as impressive as the previous season, considering that he now has to share the ball with Brunson, his numbers were still commendable.

Barrett's core value lies in his physical abilities and offensive versatility. Although there is still room for improvement, his potential and expectations for the future make him an exciting player to watch. With this roster, the Knicks have a bright future ahead of them, but the most important thing is to maintain their attitude and always be ready to face challenges.
