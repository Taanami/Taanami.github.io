  The Possible Blueprint for the Trail Blazers to Become the Ultimate Winner

Despite losing Damian Lillard and several key players, the Trail Blazers seem to be on the path of rebuilding. However, the players they received in return may still allow the team to remain competitive. In the three-team trade led by Lillard, the Blazers not only sent away Lillard, but also several key players such as Jusuf Nurkic, Nassir Little, and Keon Johnson. Many believe that the Blazers will face a long rebuilding process, similar to what we have seen in the past with teams at the bottom of the league, producing lackluster results and hoping to secure the top draft pick to regain the ability to compete in the playoffs. However, after taking a closer look at the players the Blazers acquired, it may be too early to label them as a tanking team for next season. Please continue reading to learn more about the potential impact of the trade for Jrue Holiday from the Bucks to the Celtics on the Blazers, and how it could potentially benefit the team in the long run.

The President of the Blazers, Joe Cronin, made some brilliant moves to minimize the impact of the trade on the team's rebuilding efforts. Below is a list of the players, draft picks, and draft swap rights the Blazers received in exchange for Lillard: Players: Deandre Ayton Robert Williams III Malcolm Brogdon Toumani Camara Draft picks: 2024 Warriors' first-round pick (top four protected) 2029 Bucks' unprotected first-round pick 2029 Celtics' unprotected first-round pick Draft swap rights: 2028 Bucks' first-round swap rights 2030 Bucks' first-round swap rights For now, let's not think about whether Cronin will use Brogdon to acquire more draft picks, or if the Bucks will become a team with highly valuable draft picks due to the departure of their star player, Giannis Antetokounmpo. Let's just focus on the potential development of the Blazers.

Cronin did not trade away any young prospects who have only been with the team for two years, nor did he acquire players with high salaries who cannot contribute to the team's performance.

In this trade, he acquired 2018's first overall pick Deandre Ayton, who has the potential to become a cornerstone for the team in the coming years, 2021-22's All-Defensive Second Team player and physical freak Robert Williams III, and last season's Sixth Man of the Year, Malcolm Brogdon, who is known for his steady play and outside shooting ability. Cronin stated during media day, "We want Malcolm to be part of the team. He can bring tangible help on the court and be a good spiritual leader and big brother off the court. We need players like him because our roster is very young. I want to have enough veterans to lead these young guys." Please continue reading for a potential starting lineup for the Blazers if there are no further changes to the roster before the start of next season: Point guard: Malcolm Brogdon, Scoot Henderson Shooting guard: Anfernee Simons, Shaedon Sharpe Small forward: Jerami Grant, Matisse Thybulle Power forward: Robert Williams, Kris Murray, Jabari Walker Center: Deandre Ayton (Robert Williams III as backup center) This lineup does not resemble a team that is rebuilding, but rather the Blazers' performance over the past two seasons could be classified as a tanking team.

Of course, there are still variables to consider. First, Brogdon and Williams must remain healthy throughout the season. Second, rookies Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe must show significant improvement, and Deandre Ayton must be willing to play defense.

If everything goes as planned, the Blazers may have a chance to compete in the playoffs next April.

At the start of the 2022-23 season, the Jazz traded away their two main players, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, and entered a major rebuilding phase. The Jazz used three seasons, and finally made it back to the playoffs in the 2020-21 season, playing exceptionally well. The Jazz took three seasons to rebuild, while the Blazers may only need one.

Of course, these are just past examples and do not guarantee the success of the Blazers' trade this time. However, acquiring the Warriors' first-round pick in 2024 is crucial for the team's future success.

The key now for the Blazers is to see the growth of rookies Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe, and the health of Brogdon and Williams.

If everything goes according to plan, the Blazers may become one of the strongest teams in the league in the coming years. Although it may seem like a long and arduous process, the ultimate blueprint may lead the Blazers to become the ultimate winner.
