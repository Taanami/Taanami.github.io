  Toronto Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry stated during media day that he has no worries about the new rules against flopping, and that he doesn't fake fouls. However, his statement was quickly countered by several videos posted by netizens.

 The league has recently implemented a new rule against flopping, which will result in a technical foul and a free throw for the opposing team. Lowry, who is also a hot topic for his role on the team this season, expects to be the starting point guard for the Miami Heat. He mentioned that although it hasn't been discussed yet, he has been working hard and training to earn a starting spot. At 36 years old and with 17 years of experience in the league, Lowry played in 55 games last season with 44 of them as a starter, averaging 11.2 points and 5.1 assists per game. This season will be the last year of Lowry's contract with the Heat.
