Lin Bing-sheng was heavily guarded by National Chengchi University (NCCU) in today's game. 

The Taipei Fubon Braves, also known as the "Taipei New Warlords," faced off against the NCCU Eagles in the Inter-League Invitational Tournament. Although they achieved some success from the perimeter, their interior offense lacked accuracy, and their defense was ineffective. They were ultimately defeated by a score of 70:98, suffering their first loss in the Inter-League Invitational Tournament.

In the face of this defeat, which is also their first loss since the team was formed, the head coach of the Taipei New Warlords, Brian, took a positive view, stating, "This is a valuable experience for us to accumulate. It helps us identify areas that need improvement. It's better to receive such a warning before the season rather than after." He also believes that through team integration, they will continue to improve.

Cao Xun-xiang believes that the key to their loss lies in poor rebounding and too many team mistakes. "We should protect the rebounds together to prevent the opponent from continuously converting fast breaks. We need to control the rhythm and reduce mistakes in order to have a chance to turn the game around." Lin Bing-sheng, who had performed well in previous games, was blocked by the opponents in this game, resulting in lower scoring efficiency. He said, "Being targeted by the opponents' defense is indeed a situation that the new season will encounter. I need to break through myself and perform even better to effectively help the team." It is worth mentioning that the newcomer to the Taipei New Warlords, Zhang Zhao-chen, scored double digits for the first time in the Inter-League Invitational Tournament, contributing 11 points with a three-point shooting percentage of 50%. He believes that he will give his all whenever he gets on the court and display offensive intent. "Even if I missed some opportunities in the previous games, I will still take the shot when there's an opening. I believe my shooting touch will come back."
