 According to reports from NBA media, it is rumored that veteran players within the Warriors have agreed to Dwight Howard joining the team. The Warriors will make a decision today on whether or not to sign Howard, following his two-day interview process with the team.

The Warriors' veterans have unofficially agreed to the team signing Howard, who will now train in Los Angeles with Chris Paul and Draymond Green. The team has been in need of depth in the paint, and Howard's addition would alleviate some of the pressure on players like Looney and Green on both ends of the court.

Later, Green retweeted the news and commented, "One day, one day, nothing will be leaked. One day. By the way, Jason, you're good. But one day, nothing will be leaked. I have a dream." Green's comment has a reason behind it, as rumors and videos of him fighting with Poole were leaked by internal sources. The Warriors even investigated their internal security as a result, with Steve Kerr particularly disliking the media knowing the starting lineup ahead of time.
