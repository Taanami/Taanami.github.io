 The feeling of representing the country in the international arena is very different for Tyrese Haliburton and the chemistry with the USA team.

Before the start of the World Cup this year, Tyrese Haliburton talked to Basketball Sphere about the various challenges and expectations he had for the World Cup and the USA team.

Four years ago, the USA team finished in the worst seventh place in World Cup history. This time, led by Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton, they hope to bring the USA team back to glory. Please continue reading to find out what it feels like to wear the national team jersey and how it differs from wearing the Indiana Pacers' jersey. What is it like to play under Steve Kerr? All of this will be mentioned in this article.

Wearing the national team jersey is always their first choice, no matter what kind of competition they participate in.

After the disappointing performance in China two years ago, the USA team won the gold medal in the Olympics. "When you put on the national team jersey, the expectations from everyone are at the highest level. After the previous World Cup defeat in China, the national team came back and won the Olympic gold medal. All of this makes you want to be part of a successful group, and no one wants to be associated with failure in the national team they are involved in." Please continue reading to find out how playing for the national team is a completely different experience.

Haliburton achieved an average of 20.7 points and 10.4 assists per game last season with the Indiana Pacers, which allows him to be a leader in the USA team alongside Anthony Edwards.

However, this additional responsibility is a new experience for him as well. "I would say that basketball has a different meaning to me when I'm fighting for the country. We all need to find our best position here and maximize our contributions. In the NBA, there are usually two or three players in each team who take on the responsibility and handle the offense. However, the model in the USA team is completely different. Everyone here needs to participate well in the team's operation, understand each other better, and make contributions.

All of this is very interesting and dreamlike for me." Photo source: Getty Images. Resting room leader. Please continue reading to find out that in any sport, there are two types of leaders on a team - on-court and off-court.

The former leads the team to victory on the court, while the latter has the most say in the locker room. Usually, this responsibility is taken by the most senior player in the team. "I would say Bobby Portis is the locker room leader of this USA team. He is one of the most experienced players on our team. In addition, his championship experience can lead us well."

Half human, half glory - After Gregg Popovich led the USA team to win the Olympic gold medal, the coaching baton was passed to Steve Kerr.

As the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, Kerr has won the NBA championship four times and achieved the same success as a player in the era dominated by Michael Jordan with the Chicago Bulls.

Now he has to prove himself again in the FIBA World Cup. "Coach Kerr always learns from the best. Everything he has experienced in his career is very inspiring, whether as a player or as a coach. That's why it's great to work with him."

It is very difficult to beat the same team twice in a row. The USA team was placed in Group C. Their opponents are Greece, Jordan, and New Zealand. Interestingly, during the preparation period, the USA played five warm-up games and won all of them. One of the defeated teams was Greece, and Giannis Antetokounmpo will not be playing in this World Cup.

Nevertheless, Haliburton is closely observing the upcoming challenges. "As everyone knows, it's difficult in the sports world to beat the same opponent twice in a row. Greece knows what to expect from us when we face them. I am excited, and I think it will be very interesting. Every game has new challenges.

As for the other opponents, I don't have much to say. We have been focusing on the progress of our team as much as possible and hope to be well prepared for the World Cup."
