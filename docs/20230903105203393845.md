# Brazil's Raul Neto will miss the remaining World Cup matches due to a patellar tendon rupture 
 Brazil's Raul Neto will miss the remaining World Cup matches due to a patellar tendon rupture. In yesterday's game against Iran, former NBA player Raul Neto suffered a severe injury while driving to the basket, forcing him to leave the game for medical examination. The result revealed a patellar tendon rupture, which will prevent him from participating in the rest of the World Cup. Brazil had a comfortable lead in the game, but the injury occurred around two minutes into the third quarter when Neto attempted a fast break layup. He may have already been injured before taking off, as he fell to the ground in pain.

The examination confirmed a serious injury, as the patellar tendon rupture has affected other players like Jeremy Lin in the past. Lin's recovery led to a decline in his NBA career. Neto's injury not only impacts Brazil's performance in this tournament but also affects his new team in Turkey. He will not be able to participate in any games next year. We wish Neto a speedy recovery. With Neto's absence, the ball-handling duties in Brazil's backcourt will rely on 40-year-old Marcelo Huertas, who had a solid performance with 10 points and 6 assists today.
