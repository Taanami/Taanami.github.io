  Wagner Brothers Carry Germany to Victory, Securing a Ticket to the Finals against the United States

The FIBA World Cup quarterfinals entered its second day with an exciting match between Germany, who remained undefeated, and the dark horse of this tournament, Latvia. Germany's key player, Franz Wagner, returned to the court after missing four consecutive games. However, Dennis Schroder struggled throughout the game, making only 4 out of 26 shots. Fortunately, Germany had a comfortable lead in the fourth quarter and managed to secure an 81-79 victory, setting up a semifinal clash with the United States on Friday.

Latvia performed better in the first quarter, taking advantage of Germany's offensive struggles to launch a 13-3 run, with Davis Bertans hitting three 3-pointers. However, Germany quickly adjusted their defensive strategy and players like Voigtmann and Franz Wagner made crucial 3-pointers. Maodo Lo and Andreas Obst stabilized Germany's offense in the first half, as Schroder struggled with a poor shooting performance (0 for 9). Germany held a narrow 36-34 lead at halftime.

Both teams found their rhythm offensively in the third quarter, resulting in higher scoring compared to the previous two quarters. Schroder finally made his 13th shot, and Franz Wagner became more decisive, contributing to Germany's scoring. Latvia relied on guard Arturs Zagars to initiate their offense, with Bertans continuing his hot shooting by making two more 3-pointers. In the final quarter, Germany decided to bench Schroder and increased their height advantage with Franz Wagner taking over as the primary ball handler. They started the quarter with an 8-0 run, extending their lead to 11 points. However, Latvia made a comeback with two 3-pointers, narrowing the deficit to just ten points, as Schroder finally found his scoring touch.

In the crucial moments of the last two minutes, Rodions Kurucs made a 3-pointer, Bertans successfully blocked a shot to regain possession, and Zagars scored six consecutive points to bring the margin down to two. In the final seconds, Germany's Daniel Theis made two free throws, and Schroder's attempt to cut inside was blocked. Bertans had a chance to reverse the score with a 3-pointer, but unfortunately missed, allowing Germany to secure an 81-79 victory and a ticket to the semifinals against the United States on Friday.

Germany's key player, Dennis Schroder, had a disappointing performance, making only 4 of his 26 shots. He finished with 9 points, 4 assists, 4 turnovers, 2 steals, and a +/- value of -20.

Franz Wagner, who returned from injury, had a usual solid performance with 16 points, 8 rebounds, and 3 assists, boasting a +/- value of +19. He and his brother, Moritz Wagner, together saved Germany's game, with Moritz contributing 12 points and 4 rebounds.
