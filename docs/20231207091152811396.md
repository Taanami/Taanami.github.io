The CBL University Basketball Home and Away Invitational Tournament, founded by National Taiwan Normal University, kicked off its first home game tonight (10/17) against the top UBA team, National Chengchi University. More than 500 students and faculty gathered to cheer on the home team, and popular rapper SHOU Lou Junshuo was invited to perform during halftime. As the host of this tournament, National Taiwan Normal University showcased their strong home court morale.

National Taiwan Normal University invited popular singer Lou Junshuo to perform during halftime. Last week, they played as the away team against National Chengchi University, narrowly missing a comeback victory in the second half. This week, they returned to their home court to face the opponent, and also marked the first time in 10 years that the main campus gymnasium was used as the venue for a college basketball game. Through campus mobilization and arrangements for the home court performance, the determination to win was evident. NTNU President Wu Zhengji said, "Through tonight's home game, we hope to show everyone the unity and vitality of our NTNU students."

The home and away games are not just about basketball, but also about communication and interaction between two schools. NTNU President Wu Zhengji hopes to promote campus exchanges through hosting home and away games. In their first game in 10 years as the venue for a college basketball game, NTNU attracted over 500 students and faculty to come and support.

In this game, NTNU tried to strengthen their defense and offense in the paint, but NCCU's starting lineup, led by You Aizhe and Mobaie, had a strong inside-outside connection, leading by double digits in the first quarter. Mobaie also had 14 points and 7 rebounds in the first half, while freshman Xu Deqi had the highest 6 assists in the game. Despite NTNU's efforts in the second half, led by Liu Lushi and Wei Penghe, to aggressively attack, the team's turnovers and poor shooting percentage were fatal in their comeback attempt, and they lost 48:90 to NCCU in the end.

After the game, NCCU coach Chen Ziwei said, "In the first year of NTNU's three consecutive championships, I was a player and we won the championship in this court. Now as a coach, coming back to this home court and seeing the fans cheering, it brings back a lot of memories and emotions. I am very grateful to NTNU for initiating and organizing this tournament." The first home and away game was led by NTNU, hoping to lead a new atmosphere for student basketball in the country. As an alumnus of NTNU, Chen Ziwei was filled with emotions to return to his alma mater to compete. Please continue reading.

After the game, NTNU President Wu Zhengji said, "Although the result was not as expected, we saw the fighting spirit and teamwork of our NTNU students, which is the spirit of our university. We will continue to host home and away games to promote inter-school exchanges, and we look forward to seeing NTNU's brilliant performance on the basketball court in the future. Thank you for your support!"
