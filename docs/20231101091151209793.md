#  被期待成為雷霆第三個年輕核心的Cason Wallace，上季在高中排名第一的誇張數據中，有著不少打法與Shai Gilgeous-Alexander相似之處，不過在熱身賽中，他的出手選擇明顯有些過度，但球隊希望他能多出手，各項進攻技巧與節奏感也是未來的發展重點。

 離開奇才後的第一次熱身賽，Davis Bertans有著非常積極的表現，但隨著比賽的進行，他的出手機會也越來越少，總共7次出手，其中4次是三分球，都是在熱身賽第一場對上公牛時出手，另外還有一次是罰球線外的投籃，但在熱身賽最後一場對上公鹿時，他的外線出手機會都被隊友搶走，一次也沒有出手。

The return of the second pick and the assists leader in the summer league, a review of the Thunder's preseason games.

This preseason was meaningful for the Thunder, as it allowed them to observe how Chet Holmgren has progressed since the summer league and how the new rookies and additions to the team have meshed together, including Euroleague MVP point guard Vasilije Micic who will make his debut.

Continue reading below for a focus on the starting lineup players. Chet Holmgren played 19.3 minutes per game, averaging 16.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 2.0 blocks with shooting percentages of 57.8/50.0/75.0. Jalen Williams played 22.8 minutes per game, averaging 16.8 points, 3.0 assists, and 1.8 steals with shooting percentages of 48.0/35.7/69.6. Josh Giddey played 22.3 minutes per game, averaging 12.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.3 assists with shooting percentages of 51.2/0/54.5. The most anticipated player in the starting lineup was Chet Holmgren, who returned from a season-long injury and made his debut in the NBA level game. He had a strong performance in the first game against this year's number one pick, Victor Wenbanyama, and continued to show his skills throughout the preseason. He has a variety of offensive tools, not only with a great finishing touch but also with a mid-range shot from the left and right of the free throw line. He can also anticipate rebounds and put them back in, and without the ball, he can use his positioning and catch-and-shoot abilities to help the team and regain his three-point shooting accuracy.

His offensive threat also earned him an average of 5.0 free throw attempts per game, second only to Jalen Williams' 5.8 attempts. However, he needs to work on reducing his turnovers. On the defensive end, he performed as expected, making it difficult for opponents to score at the rim. In the game against the Pistons, he had 3 blocks in just 13 minutes, blocking players like Jalen Duren, James Wiseman, and Jaden Ivey.

Although Holmgren's performance was impressive, the best player in terms of multiple statistics in this preseason was Jalen Williams. After gaining weight, he played as the power forward and not only had to defend players like Wenbanyama and Giannis Antetokounmpo, but also played a key role in the offense. Despite handling so many responsibilities, he maintained his efficiency and deserves praise.

Although Josh Giddey worked with shooting coach Chip Engelland to improve his three-point shooting before the preseason, he still struggled with his outside shooting (and free throws). He needs to work on his ball handling skills, and his best performance was against the Bucks when Brook Lopez was not playing. Hopefully, he can adjust by the start of the season.

Luguentz Dort had a very efficient performance in the preseason, shooting over 50% from the field and over 40% from three-point range. He also made smarter shot selections compared to last season. His quality over quantity performance is exactly what the Thunder need in the future. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the main player who had a great performance in the World Cup, only played in two games and was the least visible starter on the team (laughs). Bench players Isaiah Joe and Kenrich Williams were both consistent and used their movement to create scoring opportunities for themselves and the team. Olivier Sarr played as a twin tower with Holmgren for a while, but his skills are not at the rotation level yet.

New additions Vasilije Micic played 18.5 minutes per game, averaging 5.5 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 6.0 assists with shooting percentages of 30.8/15.4/50.0. Cason Wallace played 19.7 minutes per game, averaging 7.3 points, 2.0 assists, and 1.5 steals with shooting percentages of 50.0/42.9/66.7. Davis Bertans played 10.5 minutes per game, averaging 9.0 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 0.8 steals with a three-point shooting percentage of 52.9%.

In his first game playing the American style of basketball, Vasilije Micic had to adapt to many things, but his playmaking skills were brought over from Serbia. He averaged 6.0 assists per game, surpassing Giddey as the team's assist leader, and also the assist leader among all rookies in this preseason. He is very patient with the ball and uses his defensive gravity to wait until the last moment before passing to an open teammate. With the Thunder's bench lineup consisting of many players with off-ball abilities, Micic racked up 24 assists in just 75 minutes of playing time, meaning he gets an assist in less than 4 minutes!

Cason Wallace, who is expected to be the third young core player for the Thunder, showed some similarities in playing style with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in his impressive high school stats. However, in the preseason, he tended to take too many shots, and the team hopes he can take more shots, but his offensive skills and rhythm will be his focus for development in the future.

In his first preseason game since leaving the Wizards, Davis Bertans had a very active performance, but as the game went on, his shooting opportunities decreased. He only had 7 attempts, with 4 of them being three-pointers, and all 4 were in the first game against the Bulls. He also had one attempt from beyond the free throw line, but in the last game against the Bucks, he didn't even get a chance to shoot a three-pointer, with his teammates taking all the opportunities.

The future of the Thunder's main players will continue to mature as the team continues to mesh, and it will also be the focus of fans' expectations. However, in this preseason, the performance of the rookies was also impressive, and we look forward to seeing them continue to improve and bring more surprises for the team in the upcoming games.
