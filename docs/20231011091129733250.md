#  The Benefits Kelly Oubre Jr 
  The Benefits Kelly Oubre Jr. Can Bring to the Philadelphia 76ers' Depth 

At this moment, the Philadelphia 76ers' lineup for the opening game against the Bucks on October 26th is mostly set.

Of course, things could still change. Perhaps the James Harden trade will eventually go through, or maybe there will be a player who becomes available and sparks the interest of the 76ers.

Please continue reading about Kelly Oubre Jr., the veteran wing player who signed with Philadelphia this summer. While some 76ers fans may have doubts or reservations about him, signing Oubre Jr. to a veteran minimum contract is a great addition to the team's wing rotation.

In fact, the 76ers' roster is already filled with talented players. They have the reigning MVP Joel Embiid and one of the most charismatic young stars in the NBA, Tyrese Maxey. De'Anthony Melton is returning after an impressive first season with the 76ers, Paul Reed is back with a new contract and the opportunity for a new role under Nick Nurse. However, there are still many question marks on the roster. Tobias Harris and P.J. Tucker are the starting forwards for the upcoming season, and there is fierce competition among Oubre Jr., Danuel House Jr., Furkan Korkmaz, and Danny Green for the backup wing positions. Please continue reading.

Among this group, Oubre is clearly the most talented, both in terms of age and NBA experience.

Let's address his biggest weakness firstâ€”efficiency. Throughout his NBA career, his true shooting percentage has fluctuated greatly. If we want to find a reason to be optimistic, it's that his true shooting percentage has improved every year, reaching 53.4% last season. However, he does tend to commit turnovers at a slightly higher rate than assists, with an average of 1.1 turnovers compared to 1.0 assists per game. In other words, if Oubre gets the ball, there's a chance it might not stay with him.

But that's not necessarily a bad thing. For those tired of seeing Harris or Tucker hesitate to take open shots, having Oubre on the team eliminates that concern.

Having a scoring wing player off the bench who can create his own opportunities to relieve Embiid or Maxey is a good thing. Despite not living up to the high expectations as a lottery pick, Oubre still possesses qualities that make him an intriguing wing player. Standing at 6'6" with an impressive wingspan of 7'2", combined with his athleticism, he remains an attractive option.

Furthermore, Oubre has defensive potential, although effort can sometimes be an issue. It's worth noting that Oubre is 27 years old and just coming off a season where he averaged over 20 points per game. The best he could get was a veteran minimum contract with the 76ers, which is undoubtedly a crossroads in his career. He's now on a path that many players have walked before, where they have the ability but struggle to find a place on a championship-contending team.

When you have the ability but find yourself bouncing around the league without being able to contribute to a strong championship-caliber team, the best bet is to prove yourself and hope for a bigger contract in the future. Bobby Portis is perhaps the most successful example of executing this strategy. Portis was drafted in the first round by the Bulls in 2015 and had obvious skills.

Although Portis had some success, he wasn't a highly sought-after player while playing for the Wizards and Knicks. Therefore, it was somewhat surprising when he signed with the Bucks in 2020. However, Portis proved to be an important player off the bench for the Bucks and became one of the key contributors to their championship season.

Portis eventually signed a 4-year, $48.5 million contract with the Bucks, which is a clear case of a successful turnaround and shows that stories of players bouncing back from the bottom are not without precedent.

Oubre and his agent, Torrel Harris, are well aware that the 76ers will have enough salary cap space next season and the team will have Oubre's Bird rights, giving them an excellent opportunity to re-sign him if things go well.

In conclusion, signing talented players like Oubre, who are in their prime and signed for a veteran minimum contract just weeks before training camp, is undoubtedly a good move for the Philadelphia 76ers.

There is essentially no risk involved, similar to signing Patrick Beverley, Mo Bamba, and Danny Green. If Oubre or any of them underperform, they can simply be benched and let go during the offseason (or even earlier). As the opening game approaches, the situation with Harden looms like a disaster, casting a shadow over everything the 76ers do. However, signing players like Oubre is a wise move from a basketball perspective, with almost no downside. [Translated and edited for clarity. Original source: TNL Friends]
