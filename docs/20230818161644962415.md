  2022 Popular Keyword Review: Warriors Win NBA Championship, BTS Announces Solo Career without Disbanding

In just one week, 2022 will come to an end. Let's take a look back at the year using the daily Google search trends. In June 2022, what were the things that people were interested in every day? From the chart above, we can see that there were many keywords related to the NBA this month due to the NBA Finals. The NBA Finals this year saw a competition between the Warriors and the Celtics, with the Golden State Warriors ultimately winning the championship with a 4-2 victory on June 17th. This made NBA the most popular keyword of the day. The Omicron outbreak in Taiwan reached its peak this month, but the daily number of confirmed cases continued to decline.

However, due to the occurrence of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in children who tested positive, it received a lot of attention and became a hot search keyword. The Central Epidemic Command Center also announced the number of MIS-C cases and related conditions during their daily press conferences. Under this wave of the pandemic, the En En incident occurred in New Taipei City, where a child may have died due to delayed medical treatment. The father of the child believes that the city government should take responsibility. This incident is still ongoing and has not yet been resolved.

Another hot search keyword this month, with over 500,000 searches, was "Amazon Rainforest." On May 24th, this term became a hot search not related to the Amazon rainforest itself, but because someone discovered that the photos of the Amazon rainforest on Google Maps were incorrect. Instead of showing photos related to the rainforest, it showed a couple enjoying themselves in a bathroom, leading to a surge in search volume.

In terms of finance and economy, Bitcoin fell below $20,000 this month, returning to its price at the end of 2020, signaling a cryptocurrency winter. The US Federal Reserve announced a three-digit interest rate hike on the 16th to combat inflation, which was the first time in 28 years in the United States.

In Japan, the yen continued to depreciate to a 20-year low. Therefore, Bitcoin and interest rate hikes became hot search terms.

In terms of entertainment and cultural news, the release of "Jurassic World: Dominion" and the free opening of the game "Bean People" became hot search terms. In addition, the exhibition "Hell and Ghosts of Asia" at the Tainan Art Museum, particularly the display of zombies, went viral on social media, making the Tainan Art Museum a hot search keyword.

In society, earthquakes and typhoons continued to be the focus of attention. On June 16th, a fire in Hsinchu resulted in the death of eight family members and one injury. The tragedy received widespread attention because the arsonist was a family member.

A particularly unusual hot search keyword was "Tesla shooting," which was also a social incident. It involved a man driving a Tesla who demanded another car owner to give up a charging spot at a charging station. When the other party refused, he shot at them with a BB gun.

In terms of notable figures, the following individuals received public attention: Johnny Depp winning a lawsuit against his ex-wife, YouTuber Tainan Josh getting a divorce, ultramarathon runner Lin Yi-Jie (now renamed Lin Han-Chuan) being accused of luring people into committing illegal acts with unauthorized videos, the passing of the "Eight-tone Genius" Huang Wenze, badminton player Tai Tzu-Ying winning the Indonesian Open, the passing of "ELLE" editor-in-chief Yang Yin-Jie, Korean star Jang Na-ra getting married, actress Son Ye-jin announcing her pregnancy, and BTS announcing their solo careers without disbanding.

The keyword "Dragon Boat Festival" became popular because Google changed its homepage to feature a Dragon Boat Festival-themed Google Doodle, which attracted a lot of attention. The information in this article for January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December is sourced from "Google Search Trends." According to Google, "Google Search Trends" highlights search terms that have shown a significant increase in traffic over the past 24 hours, and the data is updated hourly.
