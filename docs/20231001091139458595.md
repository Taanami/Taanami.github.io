Stephen Curry, the greatest shooter in NBA history, has made significant contributions to the sport over his 14 seasons. Not only has he rewritten history and ushered in the era of the three-point shot, but he has also dedicated himself to giving back to the community and actively participating in various basketball training programs during the offseason. He strives to provide better environments and opportunities for underprivileged youth who lack access to sports resources. This is also the core concept behind the collaboration between him and professional sports brand UNDER ARMOUR to establish CURRY BRAND, with the motto "CHANGE THE GAME FOR GOOD!" Stephen Curry is not just a player in the eyes of many, but also a legend and idol of the basketball generation.

With the arrival of the 2023-24 NBA season, UNDER ARMOUR and CURRY BRAND, together with Stephen Curry, officially announce the launch of a new generation of basketball shoes - CURRY FLOW 11. The debut colorway, "Future Curry," is inspired by the idea of the future and beyond, reflecting Stephen Curry's deep desire to continue making a positive impact on society through his own strength and becoming an example for the next generation. CURRY FLOW 11 "Future Curry" will be available in the US on September 27, with detailed sales information available on the UNDER ARMOUR official Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/UnderArmourTaiwan. Let's make the future of the world better! CURRY FLOW 11 "Future Curry" conveys Stephen Curry's greatness and influence. The shoe is inspired by his values and impact, aiming to make the future better in both the basketball court and other fields. Stephen Curry said, "If you do your job well, you can achieve anything!" He further shared that Future Curry is not just designed for himself but expresses the hope that everyone can find their own rhythm and achieve the future they desire. The debut colorway of CURRY FLOW 11, "Future Curry," features a blue and green color scheme with a gradient translucent material on the inner side, showcasing the vibrancy and outlook towards the future.

The TPU support plate on the heel is engraved with the words "Created for the greatest shooter ever," paying tribute to the impact Stephen Curry has had on the court and young athletes. The symmetric shoe upper is adorned with the symbol "> <", which is a matching tattoo shared by Curry and his wife, taken from John 3:30 in the Bible: "He must increase, but I must decrease." It serves as a reminder to enjoy the present and live in the moment! CURRY FLOW 11 is technologically optimized. The dual-density UA FLOW midsole provides excellent cushioning for quick starts and stops. The new generation CURRY FLOW 11 continues the revolutionary UA FLOW midsole technology, eliminating the need for external rubber, resulting in an incredibly lightweight feel. It incorporates two different densities of UA FLOW technology: the blue and green midsole optimizes cushioning, while the white midsole at the bottom provides grip and flexibility for quick starts and stops, making jumping and changing directions more comfortable. Stephen Curry said, "UA FLOW allows me to change direction quickly on the court, creating advantages for me in those moments."

The shoe upper technology features a combination of the outer UA Warp knit upper and the inner needle-knit upper, providing not only excellent coverage but also better structural support than traditional uppers. The support plate of CURRY FLOW 11 features a new segmented design that extends to the forefoot, helping the feet switch directions quickly and providing high stability regardless of how the steps change, allowing you to focus on the court with peace of mind! On September 27, CURRY 2 FLOTRO "Future Curry" will also be released simultaneously. The blue and green charm of "Future Curry" is about to sweep the court! CURRY BRAND's new collection will be released on October 3, including various Future Curry-themed gear, allowing Curry fans to fully experience the charm of Future and beyond by wearing the complete collection!
