 Terance Mann used to feel indignant when someone said that LeBron was better than Kobe.

Terance Mann, forward for the LA Clippers, recently appeared on the show "Sessions" to discuss the importance of Kobe Bryant in his life. Besides talking about being a Lakers fan since childhood, Mann also emphasized that Kobe holds an irreplaceable place in his heart. Mann said, "I used to get really angry when someone told me that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant, like really, really angry, the kind of anger that could last all day."

Mann also mentioned that Kobe is his favorite player and that he enjoys watching his games, being a Lakers fan since he was young. Mann shared a regret about Kobe, mentioning that he had a chance to meet him at a movie premiere in the same month of his tragic accident. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, Mann was unable to meet Kobe in person. Months later, when Kobe tragically passed away, Mann felt a tremendous sense of burden and regret for not being able to have a conversation with Kobe, to express to him the significance he held in Mann's heart.
