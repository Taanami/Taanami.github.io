 In the video, NBA player Dillon Brooks was ejected from the game against the Rockets after only five minutes on the court due to a level two flagrant foul. This was his first appearance with the Rockets, and he only had one assist and two fouls during his short time on the court. The incident happened when Brooks was defending against Daniel Theis and his hand made contact with Theis' important area, resulting in the referee calling a flagrant foul. Brooks had previously shown great chemistry with his new teammates during a dance at a fan event, indicating a positive atmosphere within the team.
