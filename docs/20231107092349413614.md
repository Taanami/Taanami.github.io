 14 is the sharpshooter we can't ignore from the New Taipei City Sinbon Special Forces of Chinese Men's Basketball. With excellent positioning and a quick release, Xie Yaxuan has earned his second chance to play for the national team. Despite being plagued by injuries before the Hangzhou Asian Games, he did not participate in any official games with his team, resulting in less playing time in the early stages. However, like a microwave, he always manages to add offensive firepower when needed, despite not being exceptionally tall. His courage and tactical understanding are exactly what the Chinese team needs to fill the void at the shooting guard position.

A gamble that paid off, the efficiency of the Special Forces group

In order to prepare for the Hangzhou Asian Games, the Chinese Men's Basketball team had to deal with the injuries of their main point guard Chen Yingjun and sharpshooter Xie Yaxuan. The coaching staff took a gamble and kept him on the roster, even though he did not participate in any warm-up games or the Jones Cup to build chemistry with his teammates.

Upon arriving at the Asian Games, Xie Yaxuan did not appear on the rotation list. Even against weaker teams in the group stage, he only played for less than 5 minutes and did not have many opportunities to shoot. However, in the game against Mongolia, he was part of the Special Forces group with Abassi and Zeng Wendong, and their great chemistry was evident as he scored 5 points, grabbed 1 rebound, and dished out 2 assists in a short amount of time. This gave the head coach a glimpse of a new shining star.

As the Chinese team advanced to the top 12 as the second seed, Xie Yaxuan earned more playing time. In the first game against taller Kazakhstan, he was able to showcase his abilities and not only contribute offensively, but also on defense. This continued in the game against Japan, where he showed his skills as a 3-and-D player.

In the semifinal game against Jordan, as the score was pulled apart early on, Xie Yaxuan took on the responsibility of playing both the shooting guard and point guard positions in the second half. He made the most of his hard-earned playing time and challenged the opponents on both ends of the court. He made shots from the outside and was effective in driving to the basket, and after the game, he expressed his gratitude to the coach for trusting him. He finished the game with 11 points, 2 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 steals, living up to expectations. In the bronze medal game against China, in order to free up Chen Yingjun and Abassi to score more, coach Sun Maosen moved Xie Yaxuan to the point guard position, utilizing his good court vision to distribute the ball. Although he had less scoring opportunities, he still contributed 4 assists and proved that he is capable of being part of the rotation and contributing more to the team. However, looking at the performance of the team as a whole, it is evident that the sharpshooters were almost non-existent. Li Qiwei, who had a good performance in the Jones Cup, and Lu Junxiang, who returned to the starting lineup, were unable to produce similar results, making the offensive output of the second unit of the Chinese team lackluster. Without Xie Yaxuan's contributions, it would have been even harder to make it to the semifinals.

Having the title of a sharpshooter but lacking the skills, fundamentals are key

The current trend in basketball is to play faster and shoot from farther away. In the ever-changing world of Taiwanese basketball, most players have been chasing after high volume shooting since their student days. Many coaches also start with fast-paced tactics like run-and-gun and Pistol. Games where players shoot without hesitation are not uncommon. However, when it comes to professional basketball, there are not as many qualified sharpshooters or 3-and-D players as one might imagine. The key lies in "lack of accuracy" and "poor positioning awareness", which can be extended to "lack of tactical understanding" and "insufficient defensive skills". Therefore, in the less intense domestic league, players may have impressive statistics, but in international games where defense is key and every possession matters, players with weak fundamentals are easily exposed.

Japan and South Korea, two major basketball powers, have always had precise and impressive sharpshooters, both in the past and present. Even with limited opportunities and off-balance shots, they manage to make them. Not to mention their speed and awareness in cutting to the basket, created by their own movements.

Ryan, the head coach of the New Taipei Kings, mentioned in an interview that a shooter should always be ready to shoot. The team designs tactics for you, but you have to create opportunities for yourself by finding open spots and receiving the ball, and then take bold shots. This is what young players entering the professional world need to break through. Why is that? Because in the double-import basketball that emphasizes team play, young players often lack the confidence to take more shots, fearing that a few misses will lead to being taken out of the game, and they end up missing more opportunities and becoming more conservative. Of course, this is a two-way street, and whether the coach is willing to give space for players to do so also has an impact on their decision-making.

Therefore, although the double-import basketball is booming in recent years, the development of sharpshooters is not as good as that of student basketball. Players like Jian Youzhe, Zhu Yunhao, Lu Junxiang, and Zhang Gengyu, who shone in college, are now either inconsistent in their performance or not on the rotation list. Aside from high-caliber players like Li Qiwei and Huang Conghan, there are only Yu Huanya and Xie Yaxuan who meet the above conditions. It can be said that there are many potential players, but it is still far from possible for them to become part of the first-team squad. This also affects the formation of the team, as a lack of space means that it is harder to utilize the cutting and low-post skills of the forwards and centers. It is not easy for the Chinese team, who likes to play a fast-paced game, to overcome this challenge.
