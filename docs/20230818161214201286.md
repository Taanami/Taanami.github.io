 Bronny James and Shareef O'Neal, both living in the shadow of their famous fathers, also face heart problems.

Article: Yesterday, Bronny James, the eldest son of LeBron James, suddenly collapsed during basketball training and experienced a momentary cardiac arrest. Fortunately, he was quickly taken to the hospital and is now out of the intensive care unit.

However, this collapse may undermine all the efforts he has made so far. As LeBron's son, Bronny has had to face more attention and pressure than the average "basketball second generation". After all, he is not just a player's son, but the son of a legend who has a significant position in the entire NBA. Naturally, his basketball talent would be scrutinized more closely. However, compared to his father's dominance in high school, Bronny's leadership skills are clearly not as remarkable as LeBron's. Although he still possesses good natural abilities, he has not demonstrated the same level of dominance in high school basketball as his father did, and at one point, he was even considered to be riding on his father's coattails. Nevertheless, despite the unfavorable criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continued to improve his skills. In his senior season, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, earning a spot on the McDonald's All-American High School team. He was given the title of a five-star high school player by some basketball media outlets and received basketball scholarships from some top NCAA Division I schools.

These achievements have significantly raised Bronny's draft prospects, going from a possible undrafted player to potentially impacting the first round or even the lottery.

Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father LeBron's reputation. LeBron himself has stated that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, there is a high chance that he will join his son's team and play together. This "son-picking-father" operation undoubtedly has an impact on Bronny's market value, but we must not overlook Bronny's own efforts.

Ultimately, he chose to attend the University of Southern California (USC) and plans to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. Prior to enrollment, he posted on his social media that he wants those who doubt him to take notice.

However, the heart problem that has emerged before the start of the new college season casts a shadow over his future. Bronny's case, hindered by heart problems on the path to the NBA, reminds me of another "basketball second generation," Shaquille O'Neal's son, Shareef O'Neal.

During high school, Shareef did achieve some notable results and was regarded as a four-star high school player by sports media. He also planned to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, he was diagnosed with a heart abnormality that posed a high risk to his life and required urgent surgery.

Post-surgery rest and rehabilitation forced Shareef to be absent from high-intensity games for a whole 11 months, which was detrimental to a rising player. The golden development period was wasted, and his skills and competitiveness may have fallen far behind. In addition, with Shareef's condition, he was already not dominant in the more intense NCAA. Coaches at the university, fearing a relapse and considering performance, did not give Shareef much time, leading to a significant decline in his college performance. Eventually, he faced the fate of going undrafted in the NBA. "I always told Shareef that he would never be the next me. I want him to play his own game, his own style," Shaquille said. "Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the name O'Neal, but he still needs to create his own path. At that time, I had the pressure to succeed because I wanted to improve my life. But Shareef didn't, so I hope he can find his own goals and strive for them." Currently, Shareef is still developing in the league, waiting for an opportunity. Although he only averaged 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the last season, overcoming the shadow of his heart problem is a major breakthrough. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be confined by his father's achievements and reputation but to bravely pursue the path he chooses. LeBron most likely sees Bronny in the same way, as his love for his child will not be affected by his draft position. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by injuries and will establish his own value in the new season.
