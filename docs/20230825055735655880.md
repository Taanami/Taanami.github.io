  The Terrifying Balance Issues of the Recent Suns Transactions: Bol Bol Trade and Cam Payne Deal for Second-Round Picks

The Phoenix Suns have been one of the most active teams during the offseason. In addition to the shocking Bradley Beal trade, they have signed Drew Eubanks, Keita Bates-Diop (KBD), Chimezie Metu, Yuta Watanabe, and Eric Gordon in free agency. They have also reached contract extensions with Josh Okogie and Damion Lee. After finalizing their roster for the upcoming season, the Suns have made some adjustments through signings and trades. They first sent backup point guard Cam Payne along with a second-round pick to the Spurs in exchange for a protected future second-round pick. They then acquired 23-year-old forward Bol Bol, who was recently released by the Magic. They also made a trade involving draft rights with the Magic.

Bol Bol, like the previous acquisitions of Eubanks, KBD, Metu, and Watanabe, is a versatile forward who can play multiple positions in the frontcourt. However, he stands out as a unique player due to his exceptional physical attributes. Standing at 7 feet 2 inches (approximately 218 cm) with a wingspan of 7 feet 8 inches (approximately 234 cm), Bol possesses remarkable athleticism and skill set. His physical stature and skill package bear some resemblance to this year's top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama, who stands at 7 feet 4 inches (approximately 224 cm) with a wingspan of 7 feet 10 inches (approximately 240 cm). As a result, Bol has been dubbed the "original version of Wembanyama" by some.

Bol had his best season yet in the NBA while playing for the Magic. He appeared in 70 games and averaged 9.1 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game, all of which were career highs. However, his performance showed some inconsistency throughout the season. In the first two and a half months, Bol played 37 games, with 32 of them as a starter, averaging 26.1 minutes per game. During this period, he contributed 12.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, and a shooting percentage of 58.8%. However, as injured players like Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, and Jalen Suggs returned to the Magic's lineup in 2023, Bol's playing time and opportunities diminished. In the remaining 33 games, he started only once and saw his minutes reduced by 10. As a result, his averages dropped to 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds per game. The most significant impact of the unstable playing time on Bol was seen in his three-point shooting consistency. In the first two and a half months, he had a catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage of 38.1%, but after 2023 began, it plummeted to a dismal 8.6%.

However, when examining advanced statistics, Bol's uniqueness becomes apparent. His height and smooth touch around the basket make him difficult to defend during cuts to the basket, ranking him in the top 5% of the league in efficiency in this aspect. Additionally, his height combined with his wingspan gives him an advantage in grabbing offensive rebounds, with his put-back efficiency also ranking in the top 5% of the league.

Furthermore, Bol's excellent ball-handling skills allow him to initiate his own drives and push the ball up the court. This enables him to make decisions based on defensive alignments, either attacking the basket or taking a quick stop-and-pop jumper from beyond the three-point line. His contribution in offensive transition plays accounted for 27.6% of his overall offensive involvement last season, ranking him 15th in the league and higher than any other player on the Suns' roster.

Unlike most tall players who primarily serve as screeners in pick-and-roll situations, Bol, with his versatile ball-handling skills, can also handle the ball in those scenarios. The trend of positionless basketball in the league has made it common for big men to handle the ball, while guards and forwards set screens. Nikola JokiÄ‡, for example, frequently initiates the Invert P&R. However, the percentage of plays involving a pick-and-roll ball handler accounts for only 5.1% of the total offensive involvement. Bol, on the other hand, has a staggering 8.6% involvement in such plays, making him the number one among 7-footers in the league.

In summary, Bol possesses all-around abilities in shooting, cutting, and passing, making him a valuable asset for the coaching staff's tactical adjustments on offense. However, his impact on the defensive end may not be as significant. Despite his height of over 7 feet (approximately 213 cm), his slender build limits his effectiveness. Within a 6-foot (approximately 183 cm) radius of the basket, his defensive differential percentage was only 1.1%. In other words, when matched up against Bol, opponents' shooting percentages near the basket not only don't decrease but actually increase by 1.1%. This places him in the bottom seven among all 7-footers in the league.
