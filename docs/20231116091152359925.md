 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver recently appeared on ESPN's "First Take" and discussed the possibility of changing the format of the 2024 All-Star Game to East vs. West divisions, as well as player rest issues. He also shared his thoughts on the public trade requests made by Damian Lillard and James Harden this summer. Silver stated that trade requests have been a part of the league for years, but the issue the league wants to address is not having these matters played out in the public eye, as was the case with Lillard and Harden this year. Silver said, "I've never considered this matter (player trade requests) a secret. It's not something new in the league and can be traced back to many years ago."

However, some players want to get out of their contracts, and I believe there are also teams who don't want to sign certain contracts with players." "Of course, the league's expectation is that everyone should be proud of their contract. And if a player or team is unhappy, these issues should be solved behind closed doors." Silver then said to the host, "But I don't want to be naive. Whenever we sit down to discuss this, there will always be some situations where people will ask me, 'What happened over there?' 'Why does that player not want to execute their contract?' or 'Why is that team unhappy?' So we (the league) have to handle these situations well."
