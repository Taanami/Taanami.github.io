# The World Cup next season will be held in the Philippines 
 The World Cup next season will be held in the Philippines. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, a naturalized player from Jordan, recently gave an interview where he discussed his journey after leaving the NBA and revealed his plans for the upcoming season.

When asked about where he will be playing next season, Hollis-Jefferson replied, "The season in the Philippines will end in February, and at that time, I will be open to all calls and offers."

Hollis-Jefferson played for TNT Tropang Giga in the Philippines last season and is expected to continue playing for them in the upcoming season. However, he mentioned in the interview that his contract includes an NBA escape clause, which means that if an NBA team offers him a contract, he can negotiate a buyout agreement with TNT Tropang Giga to return to the NBA.
