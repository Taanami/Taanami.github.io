TSG 93:94 Fubon Braves, Fubon Braves Take Advantage of Timing and Home Court Advantage

In this game, the referees played a crucial role in helping the Fubon Braves secure a victory. Let's take a look at the conditions that were listed in last week's recap for the Braves to defeat Fubon: first, to find a way to limit Abasi's performance (which was not achieved as Abasi still scored 28 points with a high shooting percentage). Second, the number four local player must be strong (in this game, Lu Wei-ting's performance was lackluster). Third, the import player must outplay the opposing import player (Jones only scored 2 points in 20 minutes, while Fubon's import player, Kuzas, scored 29 points with a high shooting percentage of 78.6%). Fourth, the point guard must match up with Lin Wei-han or at least not lose too badly (this was achieved as Fubon's point guard, Brickman, outperformed the opposing point guard). Fifth, the import player must outperform the opposing import player (Kuzas outscored Fubon's import player, Chris, with 14 points to 8 points and a shooting percentage of 60%). Sixth, take advantage of Fubon's mistakes (which was achieved as Fubon struggled in the second half). Lastly, the referees' calls must be in favor of the Braves (which was also achieved). Despite all these conditions being met, the Braves only won by one point and had to rely on a last-second shot. In my opinion, this win was completely handed to them, and there are still areas for improvement. 

However, it seems that Coach Lai is starting to use Tang Wei-jie more in the rotation. Will there be any changes coming up? Please continue reading for more.

TB 111:104 Yulon Luxgen Dinos, Huang Tsung-han Scores Seven Three-Pointers, and Kao Chin-wei Dominates the Fourth Quarter

In this game, the Yulon Luxgen Dinos were without their rebounding powerhouse, Williams, and had to rely on their two imports to carry the team throughout the game. Although they were behind for most of the game, they made a comeback in the fourth quarter and gave the Taiwan Beer team a scare. Kao Chin-wei played his best game so far, scoring 23 points in 31 minutes and leading the team in the fourth quarter. Even though they couldn't complete the comeback, his performance was still commendable. On the Taiwan Beer side, Huang Tsung-han also scored 23 points, including seven three-pointers, helping the team secure their second consecutive win. As mentioned in the analysis of Taiwan Beer last week, they rely heavily on their local players to win games. In this game, their local players scored a total of 45 points, matching Yulon's 49 points from their local players. It will be interesting to see if Taiwan Beer's local players can maintain this level of performance in the upcoming games.

TB 98:89 Fubon Braves, Old Rivals Clash in a Close Game, King and His One-Man Show

In last season's game between the Taiwan Beer and Fubon Braves, the two teams had developed a deep rivalry due to various reasons. In this game, both teams fought fiercely, with the score constantly changing hands. In the end, Taiwan Beer managed to secure the win with King's unstoppable one-on-one performance. I must give a big praise to Coach Liu Meng-zhu for using the imports so effectively. If you haven't noticed, please pay attention to the substitutions made by Coach Liu. In the first half, he used a simple but effective strategy - matching the imports against each other. This means that De Guzman guarded Kuzas, Buford guarded Allen, and King guarded Brickman. This resulted in the Fubon Braves constantly rotating their guards, while the Taiwan Beer forwards were all able to focus on guarding King. As a result, King scored 33 points, while the Braves' local players only managed to score a total of 22 points. On the other hand, De Guzman and Lee Han-sung combined for 29 points, successfully containing Brickman.

Speaking of the Braves' three-point shooting percentage, it seems to be particularly low in games against the Yulon Dinos and Taiwan Beer, with an average of 23.5% against the Dinos and 9.1% against Taiwan Beer. This is due to the amount of energy the forwards have to expend on defense. Against the Dinos, the forwards have to guard Abasi and Flying Wolf, while against Taiwan Beer, they have to guard King. When you're already exhausted from defending, how can you expect to make three-point shots? This is something the coaching staff of the Braves should consider.

But let's not forget, the analysis of the Braves' depth has been mentioned before, so please refer to it if you haven't read it yet. In this game, both teams attempted 25 three-pointers, but the Braves only made 9 of them, while Taiwan Beer made 11. This is the key difference in the shooting percentage. The Braves need to make some serious changes, while Taiwan Beer is still playing at the same level as before.

In the fourth quarter of this game, King's one-man show overwhelmed the Braves, while the guards of Taiwan Beer were able to easily pick apart the Braves' defense. Are the Braves' guards focused on defending or attacking? Please continue reading for more.
