NBA's Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler made an appearance at media day with a new hairstyle, shedding his signature messy braids for a longer, more groomed look.

As the new season approaches, teams are holding media days to promote their players. Butler did not disappoint with his new hairstyle, which he explained was a reflection of his current mood.

Interestingly, Butler's hairstyle last season also caught attention, but he quickly changed it after media day. It remains to be seen how long he will keep this new look.
