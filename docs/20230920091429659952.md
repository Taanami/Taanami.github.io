 The list of Japanese players for the Asian Games has been announced, with only one player from the World Cup squad, 18-year-old rising star Yuto Kawashima, making the cut.

With less than a month to go before the start of the FIBA Asian Games basketball event on September 26, teams from various countries have been announcing their player rosters. Earlier, Japan also released the official 12-player list for the Asian Games, with only one player (Hiroya Kawasanda) from the recently concluded World Cup joining the squad. Another highlight of the roster is the inclusion of 18-year-old sensation Yuto Kawashima. 

The list of players announced by the Japanese team is as follows: Takumi Saito, Yoshitaka Imamura, Wataru Kumagai, Ryo Terashima, Kazuki Hosokawa, Hiroya Kawasanda, Yo Nishino, Raith Akaho, Shinji Takashima, Masato Ichikawa, Java Eo Yoneyama, and Yuto Kawashima. 

Japan finished 19th in the recent World Cup, showing significant improvement compared to their performance in 2019. In addition to their improved results, they also secured a spot in the Tokyo Olympics after a 48-year absence. The Asian Games will mainly focus on developing second-string players, with only one player (Hiroya Kawasanda) from the World Cup squad making it to the final 12-man roster for the Asian Games.

Hiroya Kawasanda primarily played as a backup center in the World Cup, with only five minutes of playing time against Germany and less in other games. In the absence of naturalized centers, he is expected to defend the Japanese paint alongside 206cm-tall Masato Ichikawa. Yuto Kawashima is the biggest highlight of the Japanese team at the Asian Games. At just 18 years old, he has already been selected for the senior national team. Before turning 18, he had already led Japan in two U17 and U19 World Cups, and in late June, he helped secure an eighth-place finish in the U19 World Cup, averaging 13.4 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. Currently, he is playing and studying at the NBA Global Academy in Australia, making him a key player for Japan's future.

Japan's group stage opponents include South Korea, Indonesia, and Qatar. Their first game in the group stage is scheduled for 5:30 PM on September 26 against Qatar.
