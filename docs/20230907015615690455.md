# The 2023 NBA Draft took place at the Barclays Center in New York yesterday 
 The 2023 NBA Draft took place at the Barclays Center in New York yesterday. The top three picks each had their own unique characteristics. "The French Monster" Victor Wembanyama was selected as the first overall pick by the San Antonio Spurs, and is expected to become a prominent figure in the league in the next decade. Standing at 7 feet 5 inches (226 cm) tall with an 8-foot wingspan (243 cm), Wembanyama possesses exceptional physical attributes and skills, including a guard-like shooting touch and forward-like mobility. He has been hailed as the undisputed top choice for the first pick for the past five months.

Wembanyama becomes the third player in Spurs history to be selected as the first overall pick, following David Robinson in 1987 and Tim Duncan in 1997. Both of these legendary centers helped the Spurs win NBA championships. Now, the responsibility falls on Wembanyama's shoulders as the Spurs aim to capture their sixth NBA championship, with their last title coming in the 2013-14 season. The Spurs have also decided to extend the contract of their 74-year-old legendary coach Gregg Popovich for three more years, hoping to leverage his experience coaching French players like Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to assist Wembanyama in adapting quickly to the intensity and lifestyle of the NBA.

After being selected as the first overall pick, Wembanyama shed tears of joy. In an interview with ESPN, he said, "When I heard the NBA commissioner call my name, it was like realizing my lifelong dream. I have dreamed about this moment so many times, which is why I cried." 

Brandon Miller, the second overall pick, stands at 6 feet 9 inches (205 cm) tall and possesses elite 3D physical attributes. He is the only player among the top three picks who played in a US college. Although he was chosen by the Charlotte Hornets, ESPN reported that during his workout with the Hornets, Miller told the team's owner and basketball legend Michael Jordan that Jordan was not his idol and that he had rarely watched Jordan play. Miller's journey to becoming the second pick was full of twists and turns. Just a year ago, he was projected to be a second-round pick or even go undrafted. However, Miller improved his skills and played for the number one seed Alabama University in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, propelling him into lottery territory.

However, in February of this year, Miller was unexpectedly involved in a shooting incident with one of his college teammates. Although he was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing, it nearly cost him his basketball career.

Han Dosen, who stands at just 188 cm tall but possesses explosive athleticism, had a great chance of becoming the top pick in this year's draft if it weren't for Wembanyama. Han is praised for his passing vision, excellent physical condition, and leadership qualities on the court. Besides needing to improve his three-point shooting, he has few weaknesses and is highly likely to become a highly regarded rookie in the league.

Han played in all 19 games as a starter in the development league this year, averaging 16.5 points and 6.8 assists per game. However, his three-point shooting percentage was only 27.5%. It remains to be seen whether the Portland Trail Blazers, who selected Han, will initiate another trade involving their star player Damian Lillard, or whether they will pair him with Han to form a backcourt duo. The future developments will determine this.
