# Japan led France in the warm-up match for the World Cup, Rudy Gobert talks about facing Japan's fast shooters 


Today, the World Cup warm-up match started in Japan, and Japan led France in the first quarter. In the end, France defeated Japan 88-70.

Rudy Gobert, the center for the Minnesota Timberwolves, contributed 16 points and 9 rebounds to the fifth-ranked French team. Keisei Tominaga, the NCAA star from Japan, scored the highest 20 points for the 36th-ranked Japanese team.

The French team, which includes several current and former NBA players, is one of the toughest opponents in this tournament. It was initially thought that this game would be one-sided, with France dominating Japan. However, Japan displayed a resilient style of play, giving fans hope for an upset victory against a European team.

With Japan's star player Yuta Watanabe absent due to injury, Japan relied on shooter Keisei Tominaga to provide offensive firepower.

The 22-year-old guard performed excellently, helping Japan close the gap to 3-7 with a three-pointer and igniting the enthusiasm of the 13,009 spectators with several outside shots. Japan took the lead twice by forcing turnovers and hitting three-pointers, trailing 20-23 at the end of the first quarter and closely contesting the score at 40-45 by the end of the second quarter. At the start of the third quarter, France expanded their lead to 53-44, but Japan continued to narrow the gap with their shooting. Led by Gobert, Evan Fournier of the New York Knicks, and former San Antonio Spurs player Nando de Colo, France launched a 25-17 offensive in the third quarter, taking control of the game. "I felt like we had a chance to win until halftime," said Japan's head coach Tom Hovasse. "We lost the game, but we gained confidence. Our shooting percentage did not reach the required level, and we did not have enough free throws. These are the issues we need to address." Three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Gobert, stated that despite the absence of Yuta Watanabe and Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura, he and the French team were not surprised by Japan's intensity in the first half. "They are a team with many shooters and fast players," said Gobert. "The first quarter was a bit tough, but later on, we were able to recover and become more physical, dominating our game." In the next game, France will continue their warm-up matches against Australia, a contender for the World Cup medals, at the same venue in Tokyo.
