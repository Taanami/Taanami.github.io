 Former PLG Hsinchu Lion player Pan Guanhan has been ordered to pay NT$200,000 in compensation after being caught cheating. His wife has revealed their current situation and income.

Pan Guanhan, a former PLG Hsinchu Lion player, was involved in an extramarital affair with a female fan. Both Pan and the woman were ordered to pay NT$300,000 in compensation to Pan's wife. His wife then filed for divorce and requested an additional NT$500,000 in compensation. The Taipei District Court granted the divorce and ordered Pan to pay an additional NT$200,000. The case is appealable.

Pan Guanhan, a former player for the Hsinchu Street Attack Lions, was previously exposed for having an affair with a female fan and attempting to force his wife and child out of their home. After the news came to light, the team immediately announced his release. Pan's model wife also filed a lawsuit, seeking joint compensation of NT$500,000 from Pan and the female fan. In the first trial at the Taipei District Court, they were ordered to pay NT$250,000. However, in the second trial, the panel considered the extramarital affair between Pan and the female fan to be a genuine violation of their marriage, and the compensation was increased to NT$300,000.

Pan Guanhan's wife is a pharmacist and also works as a model. She claimed that they got married in March 2018, but Pan started dating the female fan in February 2021. They referred to each other as husband and wife in their communications and exchanged messages such as "We haven't had sex for five days, I'm not wet, I have no charm, and no sexual desire" and "I only want you. Do you want to ask your wife if you can successfully get a divorce?" His wife believed that Pan's interaction with the female fan had harmed their marriage, so she filed a lawsuit requesting NT$500,000 in compensation from both Pan and the female fan.

The lawyers appointed by Pan and the female fan argued that due to his work, Pan had to live in the players' dormitory after marriage, which often led to conflicts with his wife. Furthermore, Pan had been traveling between Taipei and Hsinchu for a long time to support his wife's social media career. His wife had previously requested a divorce multiple times, and their marriage had long been in name only.

Pan Guanhan admitted to having sexual relations with someone else but stated that he and his wife had grown apart a long time ago, and their marriage was already deteriorating. He also believed that his wife had faults. Moreover, he had already been ordered to pay NT$300,000 in compensation to his wife and the female fan, and his wife could not demand further compensation.

Pan Guanhan agreed to the divorce, but he saw no reason for his wife's additional compensation request. The Taipei District Court acknowledged that Pan and the female fan had engaged in sexual activities that infringed upon the rights of the spouse, and compensation had already been ordered in a separate case. Therefore, the court granted the divorce. The court also recognized that Pan had consensual sexual intercourse with other individuals, which made it impossible for his wife to maintain the marriage, causing her significant mental distress.

Pan Guanhan's wife also revealed his current situation. He currently co-owns a barbecue snack shop with friends, earning around NT$50,000 to NT$60,000 per month. Taking into account Pan's current circumstances, the Taipei District Court ruled that he should pay NT$200,000 in compensation to his wife.
