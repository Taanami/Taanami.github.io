 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Discusses Players' Trade Requests: "It's Not a Secret Anymore, But Issues Should Be Resolved Behind Closed Doors"

Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, recently appeared on ESPN's "First Take" and discussed the potential division realignment for the 2024 All-Star Game and the issue of players resting during the season. He also shared his thoughts on the public trade requests made by Damian Lillard and James Harden this summer.

Silver acknowledged that trade requests have been happening in the league for years, but the concern now is to keep these matters from becoming public, as seen with Lillard and Harden this year. He said, "I've never treated this (player trade requests) as a secret. It's not something new in the league, and it goes back a long time."

He also mentioned that some players may want to get out of their contracts, while some teams may not want to honor certain contracts. "Of course, the league's expectation is that everyone takes pride in their contracts. And if a player or team is unhappy, these issues should be resolved behind closed doors," Silver added.

However, he also acknowledged that he cannot be too naive and that there will always be questions about these situations. "Whenever we sit down to talk about these matters, there will always be someone asking, 'What happened over there?' 'Why does that player not want to honor their contract?' or 'Why is that team unhappy?' So we (the league) have to handle these situations carefully," he said.
