Yesterday's quarterfinal match between Canada and Slovenia in the FIBA World Cup ended with the focus on the referees' issues. In the fourth quarter, both Dillon Brooks and Luka Doncic received their second technical fouls of the game and were ejected. In the post-game press conference, Doncic spoke about being ejected, saying, "It was evident that I was frustrated. Playing for the national team means a lot to me, and sometimes I can't control myself when we encounter problems on the court."

Regarding the fairness of the referees' officiating, Doncic said, "Even my teammates told me that the referees said, 'We won't blow the whistle for Brooks because he keeps approaching us.' " Doncic expressed that this was highly unfair. Despite acknowledging his tendency to complain, he still believed it was unjust. It was unfair for Canada to play physically without the referees blowing the whistle. 

As for Brooks' defense yesterday, Doncic praised him, saying, "Brooks has always played this way. I know many people don't like him, but I respect what he does on the court, and he does it quite well."

Regarding the key to Canada's victory yesterday, it wasn't just their strong defense but also the performance of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander on the offensive end. Doncic said, "SGA is a difficult player to defend. He is one of the best players in the world."
