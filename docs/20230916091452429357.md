  2023 World Cup World Cup Talk 2: Reinforcement is a must for the United States, and they also need the assistance of large wing players outside the restricted area.

After discussing the important role of the NBA in the World Cup, let's talk about how the United States can regain its glory in the face of the Olympics.

One of the fastest and most immediate solutions is to have veterans like Stephen Curry (after all, he has never played in the Olympics) and LeBron James join the team. However, they are already old and prone to injuries, so it's hard to assess their chances. Reinforcement is necessary, especially in the restricted area and the large wing positions.

Continuing reading, the two major weaknesses of the United States in this World Cup are rebounding and defense in the restricted area. In the consecutive games against Montenegro and Lithuania in the second round, the United States was dominated in rebounding, and the flaws of the center Jaren Jackson Jr. (JJJ) in defending the restricted area were exposed. Although JJJ is intimidating on defense, he is not good at facing low-post heavyweights, and his rebounding ability is insufficient for a power forward.

In addition, JJJ easily gets into foul trouble in both the NBA and FIBA, resulting in a significant drop in the defensive intensity of the United States.

Other players in the restricted area, such as Bobby Portis, lack shot-blocking ability and have a slim build. Paolo Banchero is better on offense than defense, lacks good defensive judgment, and has limited experience. Walker Kessler is too inexperienced and can block shots but struggles with defensive switches. Their offensive abilities also put the team at a disadvantage, as they often end up playing 4-on-5. All three of them have major question marks and cannot provide stable offense and defense in the restricted area. The United States' warm-up games clearly showed a significant drop in defensive performance when JJJ was not on the court. JJJ possesses the ability to shoot from the perimeter, protect the rim, and switch to the perimeter, making him irreplaceable. In the game against Lithuania, JJJ had two fouls in the first quarter, three fouls in the first half, and eventually fouled out after playing only 15 minutes. Although he had the best +/- value for the United States in the game, his limited playing time had limited impact.

Continuing reading, the fastest solution would be to find a center who can dominate on both ends of the court, which leads to the consideration of Joel Embiid, a super center who holds both American and French nationality.

However, it is unknown which country Embiid would choose to represent, and his injury-prone attribute raises concerns about his ability to play international games. Therefore, solving the problem in the restricted area becomes a top priority, once again highlighting the regret of Evan Mobley, the Cavaliers' power forward, not making the team. Mobley is young and has not played in a major international tournament, but he was named to the All-Defensive First Team for the 2022-23 season. Despite his slim build that limits his ability to defend centers for extended periods of time and his inconsistent shooting, his defense alone can make a significant impact.

He can also help with high-level playmaking and fill the gap of not having a tactical center for the United States in this tournament. Besides Mobley, who else can the United States look for? Bam Adebayo, the starting center for the Miami Heat in the Tokyo Olympics, is the top candidate. Although his shot-blocking ability is not top-notch, his defensive range is extensive. He may not have the height, but his athleticism is exceptional, making him one of the best rim protectors who can execute switches in the paint.

Adebayo will turn 27 next year, and there is a possibility that he will continue to represent the United States in the Paris Olympics. In the Tokyo Olympics, the United States also had Draymond Green, the former Defensive Player of the Year and a key player in the small-ball lineup of the Golden State Warriors. Even after Adebayo leaves the court, the United States can still maintain a certain level of defense and switching ability in the restricted area. In this World Cup, the United States lacks players with similar functions, not to mention the high-level playmaking, screening, and off-ball movement qualities that Adebayo and Green possess. 

If possible, Anthony Davis, who showcased his defensive prowess again in the 2023 playoffs, can significantly enhance the team's strength in the restricted area. When healthy, Davis is the best defender in the NBA, and even though his shooting can be inconsistent, he can still contribute on offense. He has also represented the national team in the past. However, his age and health factors make his participation uncertain.

If we focus on young big men, Jarrett Allen, the center for the Cleveland Cavaliers, is a potential candidate. Allen represented the United States in the 2016 U18 Americas Championship but has not played for the national team since then. He can protect the rim, solidify rebounding, and has some resistance against speedy players when switching on defense. He can be considered one of the top centers.

Offensively, his threat is mainly in the paint, and he lacks playmaking skills. However, his excellent screen-setting ability can make up for it. He will be 26 next year, which is considered his prime, and if given the opportunity, he could be of great help. If the goal is to find a traditional big man, Mitchell Robinson, the center for the New York Knicks, is a possible candidate. However, he is purely a paint presence, although he is good at shot-blocking and grabbing offensive rebounds, his ability to execute tactics is limited, and he may just be a decoration in the Kerr system. Would it be better to directly use Kevon Looney? In fact, the United States has limited options when it comes to big men, as most of the centers who excel in defense and high-level playmaking in the 2022-23 season are foreign players.

Domantas Sabonis (Lithuania), Steven Adams (New Zealand), Deandre Ayton (The Bahamas), Jusuf Nurkic (Bosnia), and Ivica Zubac (Croatia), not to mention the current top center Nikola Jokic (Serbia). Therefore, besides traditional big men, the United States needs large wing players who can support the restricted area.
