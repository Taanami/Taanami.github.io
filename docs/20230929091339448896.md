  NBA star Serge Ibaka signs one-year contract with Bayern Munich

Serge Ibaka, a veteran with 14 years of NBA experience, has officially joined German powerhouse Bayern Munich. The signing was confirmed earlier today after negotiations between Ibaka and the club. Ibaka expressed his honor and excitement in joining Bayern Munich, stating that he is privileged to be a part of such a prestigious and world-renowned sports club. He hopes to contribute his experience to help the team reach the highest level in European basketball and assist head coach Laso in establishing high standards and a strong professional attitude.

"I always give my all, both on and off the court, and I will do the same here in Munich to help the younger players. On the court, I want to do whatever is necessary for the team, from defense to showcasing my shooting skills," Ibaka added.

Regarding his past NBA experience, Ibaka mentioned that despite having a long career in the NBA, he maintains the same attitude and passion for the European league. He expressed his enthusiasm for the game and his love for basketball. Ibaka also emphasized the importance of head coach Laso, whom he considers one of the best coaches in the world. Throughout his 14 seasons, Ibaka gained fame for his exceptional shot-blocking abilities, particularly during his time with the Thunder, where he averaged 3.7 blocks per game during the 2011-2012 season. He has also played for the Magic, Raptors, Clippers, and Bucks, winning the NBA championship with the Raptors in 2019. Throughout his career, Ibaka has averaged 12 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks per game. However, he had limited playing time with the Bucks last year, appearing in only 16 games with an average of 11 minutes per game.
