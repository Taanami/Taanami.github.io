 T1 League Taichung Sun Expresses Strong Protest Against T1 League's Unreasonable Decision and Will Seek Legal Recourse

The Taichung Sun released a statement protesting against the decision made by the T1 League. Earlier today, the T1 League announced that the Taichung Sun would not be allowed to participate in the 2023-2024 season due to their failure to meet the league's financial regulations, despite multiple reviews by the T1 League's executive committee.

The Taichung Sun has responded to the T1 League's decision with a statement, expressing their strong protest against the league's unfair and unreasonable actions. The statement reads as follows: Statement from the Taichung Sun. Photo/Taichung Sun.

The Taichung Sun is deeply disappointed and saddened by the T1 League's decision. Over the past few months, we have been working towards reaching an agreement with the T1 League to ensure that the Taichung Sun meets the league's financial regulations. We believe that we have made necessary efforts to address any potential issues. However, the T1 League's decision is still an unfair and unjust treatment towards us.

We will take all necessary legal measures to defend our rights. We believe that our actions are lawful and in line with the league's regulations. We will not be intimidated by baseless accusations and will not accept any unfair punishment.

We hope that the T1 League will reconsider their decision and work with us to resolve any existing issues. We also call on all the fans who support the Taichung Sun to continue to stand by us, as we will not give up our rights.
