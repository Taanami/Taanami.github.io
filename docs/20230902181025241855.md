 NBA explains Harden's reason for calling Morey a liar

According to reporter Shams Charania, the NBA has investigated the claims made by Philadelphia 76ers guard James Harden, who referred to general manager Daryl Morey as a liar. The investigation revealed that Harden's accusation stemmed from Morey's promise to trade him soon, which ultimately did not happen. Shams tweeted, "Investigators looked into the matter, and Harden told the NBA officials that Morey had informed him that he would be traded 'soon' after he exercised his player option." The situation between the two parties is now even more serious than before the "liar" comment was made. While the 76ers plan to keep Harden, there is a possibility that he may not report for duty.

However, if Harden fails to report, he would be subject to restrictions imposed by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), as he would not be able to sign with another team until the 76ers give their consent.
