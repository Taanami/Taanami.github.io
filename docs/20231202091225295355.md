Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban recently appeared on Patrick Beverley's podcast, "Pat Bev Pod," where he discussed the issue of players' bad habits. During the interview, Cuban also revealed that he had traded away a player due to their excessive drug use.

Beverley asked, "If a player is averaging 17 points per game, but has some bad habits. Maybe he's into partying or gambling, everyone has their vices. As a team owner, does this information affect how much you offer him in a contract?" Cuban replied, "Absolutely, 100%, because this is a team. I'm not lying, I have traded players because they were doing too much."

"Each team has its own culture. If you have young players who are still learning the game and they occasionally smoke, but don't understand the team or NBA culture, and then you have a guy who lives on your floor in the hotel and suddenly other young players start picking up these bad habits, you see them walking out of their rooms with red eyes, and you don't want them going down that path," Cuban explained. "Smoking is one thing, but the strength and frequency of what you're smoking is another. If you go beyond a certain level, then you have to consider the bigger picture, and that doesn't fit our team culture," he added.

In the lives of NBA players, bad habits and temptations are everywhere, but as a team owner, Cuban places great importance on players' discipline. He not only wants them to perform well on the court, but also to maintain good habits off the court. Therefore, when a player's bad habits start affecting the overall atmosphere and culture of the team, Cuban will not hesitate to trade them away.
