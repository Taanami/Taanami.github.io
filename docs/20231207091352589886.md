NBA player Anfernee Simons is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks after sustaining a sprained thumb ligament on the inner side of his hand in the opening game against the Clippers. The Portland Trail Blazers officially announced the news. In his last game against the Clippers, Simons played for 27 minutes and scored 18 points, with 4 assists, 2 rebounds, and 2 steals.

During Simons' absence, it is expected that Shaedon Sharpe will be promoted to the starting lineup and both he and Scoot Henderson will see more playing time. Malcolm Brogdon will also take on a bigger role in scoring and connecting the team.

According to the team's medical department, Simons is currently receiving treatment and rehabilitation, and his recovery progress will continue to be monitored.
