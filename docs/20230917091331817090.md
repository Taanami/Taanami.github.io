  The Successor Challenge of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Canada's Ace, After Steve Nash in the 2023 World Cup

This year, Canada has gathered a roster of seven NBA players, all above the league's average level: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luguentz Dort, RJ Barrett, Kelly Olynyk, Dillon Brooks, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and Dwight Powell. Even though Jamal Murray, who also participated in national team training, didn't end up playing in the World Cup, Canada was still considered one of the strongest teams with the potential to win the championship. Not only do they have a chance to bring home their first World Cup medal, but they also have their sights set on the upcoming Paris Olympics. It has been over 20 years since Canada last competed in the Olympics, and nearly 90 years since they won a medal. The future looks promising for Canada.

However, starting from the warm-up matches three weeks ago, the team's weaknesses, including a lack of a ball handler, have become apparent. Despite winning all three games in the first round of the World Cup group stage, the issues persisted. In the first game of the second round on September 1st, they suffered a 65-69 defeat against Brazil, putting them in a precarious situation where one more loss would end their journey for the World Cup championship. Although Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) wasn't the main culprit for Canada's loss in this game (he scored the team-high 23 points on 8-of-18 shooting, and combined with the returning Dort's 17 points, they contributed 40 points with a 48% shooting percentage), the rest of the Canadian teammates only managed to score a total of 25 points with a 20% shooting percentage. Additionally, there were some questionable on-court decisions and actions from head coach Jordi Fernandez. It can be said that without SGA, Canada wouldn't have had a chance to contend until the final seconds. However, the most capable player should bear the most responsibility for the defeat and have the highest expectations for improvement.

SGA is no exception to this. After the game against Brazil, head coach Fernandez publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with the performance of his players, specifically mentioning that SGA "needs to not only score but also organize the team's offense, which he didn't do." Although Fernandez also pointed out Barrett, Olynyk, and Brooks for not fulfilling their respective roles, as a Thunder fan, I am naturally more concerned about the head coach's criticism of the team's best-performing player.

Despite acknowledging the head coach's flaws, Fernandez's comments about SGA are not entirely wrong. SGA's performance in this World Cup hasn't been outstanding. He averaged 22.3 points (ranked 6th among all registered players), 7.3 rebounds (ranked 20th), and 4.8 assists (ranked 28th). His overall shooting percentage of 51.6% looks impressive, making him one of the brightest stars in this World Cup. It's true that SGA has been able to take control of the game in the third quarter, showcasing his scoring abilities even in international play where space is more limited. His crafty drives, changes of direction and speed, make it difficult for opponents to predict whether he will take a mid-range shot or continue attacking the basket, not to mention his consistent free-throw shooting. In simple terms, SGA, who can't be guarded in the NBA, remains difficult to guard in international play, and he is still reliable. However, upon closer examination of the games, there are some worrisome aspects: his overall shooting percentage of 51.6% is composed of a 61.4% shooting percentage from two-pointers and a 27.8% shooting percentage from three-pointers. The subpar shooting from beyond the arc, below 30%, is not something to be feared.

In a situation where he mostly relies on himself to create offense, SGA, who is not known for his outside shooting and has a slightly slow shooting motion even with a one-motion shot, hasn't been ideal in terms of his three-point shooting quality and quantity. This scoring pattern only makes it easier for opponents to predict his intentions, resulting in increased chances of mistakes or failures. Although his 3.2:1 assist-to-turnover ratio is impressive, ranking 28th in average assists, one could argue that SGA is one of the worst point guards in this World Cup. It's not just Fernandez mentioning the fact that he had only 2 assists and 2 turnovers against Brazil (of course, the inability of his teammates to make shots is also a significant reason for the lack of assists). In fact, as a point guard, SGA has the ability, awareness, and willingness to pass, but he is a player who relies on the coach's system rather than having his own system. In a situation where the team hasn't had much time to build chemistry and the coaching staff hasn't designed many half-court offensive plays, Canada doesn't have another ball handler to rely on. While there are multiple wings who can handle the ball and receive passes, when it comes to organizing and initiating offense, it all falls on SGA, highlighting his deficiencies in that area. Furthermore, SGA's transitions and decisions between "organizational mode" and "scoring mode" still appear obvious and deliberate, sometimes giving viewers the impression that "he won't attack the basket actively in this quarter" or "he won't pass for the next five minutes," which is too one-sided. These criticisms may be too demanding for SGA, as finding a balance between scoring and organizing is not easy, especially for someone with strong offensive abilities like him. Without a backcourt teammate like Josh Giddey, who can assist him in playmaking, SGA appears isolated in Canada's backcourt.
