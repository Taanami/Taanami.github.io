 202324 Key Player Washington Wizards Jordan Poole plays his own melody of life

 The original sin was constantly magnified and scrutinized in the life of the Warriors. In October of last year, the Warriors and Jordan Poole completed an early contract extension, successfully negotiating a four-year, $140 million deal with $123 million in guaranteed money and an additional $17 million in incentives. Without the incentives, his salary for the 2023-24 season will be $27.45 million, accounting for about 20.5% of the team's salary cap. Please continue reading

 Originally seen as the Warriors' future star, Poole's signing of a four-year contract seemed to be to take over from Stephen Curry. However, after signing the contract, both the media and most fans outside of the Warriors' own media did not understand their decision. The Warriors were already being crushed by their high team salary, and the penalties for repeated luxury tax violations were also coming. In addition, the rift between Poole and Draymond Green caused endless speculation. This also meant that after signing the contract, Poole was destined to face harsh scrutiny.

 As expected, Poole received a lot of attention from the public during the 2022-23 season, from the difference in his performance as a starter and off the bench, to his shot selection and relationship with teammates on the court. The media was always able to take things out of context and focus on the conflicts, constantly accusing Poole of not being able to live up to his $30 million future value and lacking leadership qualities.

 What's more, Poole's underwhelming performance in the playoffs was the talk of the town. It was a far cry from the previous year when he helped the Warriors win the championship. His stats significantly declined and the Warriors were on the brink of elimination, with Poole being blamed for not playing well. He was described by the media as a high-paid big trash, similar to Russell Westbrook's situation with the Lakers in the past. Eventually, in a trade involving Chris Paul, as the public hoped, he was shipped out as a high-paid liability.

 In his new life with the Wizards, it is without a doubt that Poole's progress or regression will be closely monitored. After Bradley Beal was traded, Jordan Poole became the strongest scorer in the Wizards' backcourt. He is expected to be the first or second option on the team with Kyle Kuzma. It is foreseeable that he will be a stable starter. In the past with the Warriors, he was mostly the third or fourth option on offense. Can he handle such a big responsibility now that he's in Washington? The biggest issue with Poole's offense is his high number of turnovers. He averaged 3.1 turnovers per game, second only to Stephen Curry's 3.2. However, his total number of turnovers is much higher. Last season, he had a total of 252 turnovers, ranking fourth in the league. This was still with the support of a mature offensive system with the Warriors. Without reliable teammates to share the burden of opposing defenses, Poole is easily pressured and prone to turnovers.

 If he continues to play the same way with the Wizards as he did with the Warriors, without reliable players to set screens for him, Poole will be even more heavily targeted. Daniel Gafford is not an ideal pick-and-roll partner, but the Wizards don't have better options. The only other options are the older Mike Muscala and Taj Gibson. The environment is quite hostile. Although the Warriors have been training Poole to handle the ball for longer periods of time in recent years, in order to prepare him to eventually take over Curry's position, they didn't have much time to let him make mistakes and learn. Under the pressure of being on a championship team, Poole's ball-handling skills did not progress smoothly. His dribbling is flashy, but he often holds onto the ball for too long, which can disrupt the team's offensive flow. When he dribbles the ball three to six times before taking a shot, his two-point field goal percentage is 45.8%. When he dribbles the ball more than seven times before taking a shot, his field goal percentage is 47%. This may look decent, but his field goal attempts with 0-2 dribbles account for over 50% of his shots, and his efficiency decreases when he dribbles more than three times, which is one of the reasons for his inconsistent offensive performance.

 With a lot of time handling the ball, his efficiency in isolation is not high. Coupled with being pressured by opponents, his poor passing becomes a major issue on the offensive end. However, there is still hope for a turnaround by having Jordan Poole focus on being the team's primary scorer. Newly acquired point guard Tyus Jones, who came from the Grizzlies, will be Poole's most important partner next season. Compared to Poole, who has only been developing his ball-handling skills in recent years, Jones has been playing point guard for the past eight years. Although he didn't have many minutes on the court, his assist numbers were quite low. However, when looking at his assist-to-turnover ratio, he was often in the top rankings. His composed ball-handling is his signature, and there were rumors last year that the Wizards were interested in acquiring him. This year, they finally succeeded. The chemistry between Jones and Poole, who will be the starting backcourt for the Wizards next season, will greatly affect the team's performance in the first half of the season.
