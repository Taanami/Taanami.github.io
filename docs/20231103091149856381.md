未來將物超所值Devin Vassell的聖城定位

Devin Vassell recently signed a huge contract extension, which will keep him with the Spurs for a long time to come.

The Spurs have also signed long-term deals with Vassell and Keldon Johnson, and have promising young players like Jeremy Sochan and Victor Wembanyama who could become foundational pieces for the team, as their rookie contracts have yet to expire.

This moment gives a sense of continuity. Vassell will soon realize that a high salary brings more attention, especially since his salary will reach up to $30 million next season. However, when it comes to NBA contracts, it is always better to take a step back and understand the context before drawing any conclusions about whether the contract is good or bad. And at the moment, Vassell's contract looks like a good one. Please continue reading to find out why.

For a player of Vassell's caliber, this extension is a great deal. In today's NBA, contract values sometimes seem absurd, so it is understandable that some people may have scoffed at the news of a five-year, $146 million contract. Vassell is a wing player who has only performed well for half a season and does not possess any exceptional skills.

However, looking beyond these facts, his contract is actually quite reasonable. Vassell will receive a huge sum, but in NBA standards, it is not that much. His base salary would have ranked 46th in the league last season, and that does not even include any potential changes in the free agent market next summer, where he could potentially be pushed down to the 50s.

But now his salary will be on par with players like Jerami Grant, Kristaps Porzingis, and Jordan Poole. If he stays healthy, this at least does not seem unreasonable. However, are there players in the league who perform better but earn less? Please continue reading for the answer. Of course, it is possible, but that is just how things work in the NBA - timing is everything.

Some players may still have contracts from when the salary cap was lower or when they had yet to prove their value. Looking at the bigger picture, it seems like Vassell is receiving a fair amount. Of course, things could go wrong - he could regress or get injured - but he could also exceed the value of his contract. In the previous season, when Vassell was healthy and able to play, he averaged 18 points, 4 rebounds, and 3+ assists per game, while also making 39 three-pointers. In addition, he showed a certain level of shot-creating ability and has yet to fully tap into his potential as a defender.

At 23 years old, with talent and a strong work ethic, it is reasonable to expect Vassell to improve with experience, which is why the length of his contract is also reasonable. The Spurs should still have plenty of cap space next season Please continue reading It would be shortsighted to focus solely on Vassell's contract, as it is important to consider the team's salary as a whole.

There are always opportunity costs when it comes to positions and salaries, so it is not wise to just look at this contract without considering the bigger picture. Luckily, the overall situation looks good.

Vassell's new contract will take effect next season, and his on-court value will far exceed his cap hold, which will affect the Spurs' cap space. Extending the contract rather than waiting has two major benefits. First, if Vassell stays healthy, he could play a full professional season and become a restricted free agent, or simply sign a shorter contract to re-enter the market earlier.

By signing him now, the Spurs can avoid this risk. Also, signing him now shows their commitment to Vassell, which can maintain a good relationship between the team and player. There have been reports that in the past, the Spurs had several promising players who were dissatisfied with having to wait until they became restricted free agents to get a salary bump, including Kawhi Leonard. Now, creating enough cap space to make a splash in the free agent market and reaching an agreement with restricted free agents early are equally important.

In the past, the Spurs had to wait for Kawhi because their priority was to get LaMarcus Aldridge.

Now, even with Vassell's contract, the Spurs' current contracts are only around $102 million, which is $40 million below the salary cap.

The salary cap will limit them, but the only potential issue is Zach Collins' contract of around $15 million. The Spurs also have some non-guaranteed or partially guaranteed contracts, so they could easily get rid of the $15 million problem by waiving Devonté Graham, Julian Champagnie, and Charles Bassey.

Although they are unlikely to go all-in on a major player, they should have enough cap space if they want to do so.

Retaining Vassell was the right decision, and it will allow the Spurs to continue their development in the coming years. Vassell has the potential to become an excellent wing player, and he is a young player with a great attitude, something that is valued highly in the Spurs organization. If he can stay healthy and continue to improve, this contract will be a great value for the team. It also shows the Spurs' long-term plan and their confidence in building a competitive team, with Vassell being an important piece of that puzzle.
