 During the NBA media day, Jimmy Butler's new long hairstyle caused quite a stir in the league. Viewers came up with various names for his new look, and during the photoshoot, his teammate Bam Adebayo couldn't stop laughing while looking at his hair, even to the point of tears. In another video, Adebayo can be heard saying that Butler's lip ring is annoying, to which Butler responds, "I have to maintain my character." Adebayo then jokes, "Sh*t, you really got this haircut for media day?" Butler explains, "It's my Halloween look." During a press conference, Adebayo was asked for his thoughts on Butler's new hairstyle, to which he replied, "I think he's misunderstood, we all have moments when we get caught up in our emotions." Adebayo was also asked about his mother's reaction if he were to keep his hair long, to which he responded, "She would beat me up and kick my butt."
