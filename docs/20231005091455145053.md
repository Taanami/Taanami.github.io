  Luka Doncic, the golden boy of the 2023 World Cup, clashes with the referees as Slovenia suffers defeat in the quarterfinals.

Despite Luka Doncic's incredible performance, the Slovenian team was unable to secure a spot in the semifinals, losing to Canada in the 2023 FIBA World Cup.

Both teams displayed strong offensive firepower, with each having a superstar leading the way. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) from Canada and Luka Doncic from Slovenia, both members of the NBA First Team for the 2022-23 season, showcased their similar skills in footwork, rhythm changes, and deceleration abilities. SGA exhibited agility and versatility, while Doncic demonstrated strength and power that were hard to stop. Canada had the advantage of having Dillon Brooks and Lu Dort, two strong defensive players, as well as Nickeil Alexander-Walker, who was faster but less physical. Brooks and Dort used their robust bodies to harass Doncic throughout the game. The physicality resulted in numerous fouls and technical fouls being called. The statistics showed that Canada committed fewer fouls and had more free-throw attempts, with a difference of 14 free throws in favor of Slovenia. However, those who watched the game could see that Slovenia's players were the ones constantly complaining and gesturing towards the referees, ultimately leading to technical fouls being called against them. In the second quarter, Doncic received his first technical foul, and in the fourth quarter, during a comeback attempt, he protested again and received his second technical foul, resulting in his ejection from the game. Doncic's style of play often involves creating a lot of physical contact, which can be difficult for referees to officiate. However, his tendency to complain and get tangled up with the referees is well-known. In the 2022-23 season, Doncic received 17 technical fouls, ranking third in the NBA. In the 21-22 season, he received 18 technical fouls, ranking second, and in the 20-23 season, he again received 17 technical fouls, also ranking second. This consistent ranking among the top three players in technical fouls shows that it has become a regular occurrence for him. In a previous article, Doncic himself mentioned this, saying, "Complaining to the referees is one of Doncic's trademarks, and he has accumulated a large number of technical fouls in the NBA." FIBA referees have a lower tolerance for such behavior, as seen in a technical foul Doncic received in a previous game against Vida Island in the preliminary round, as well as in his past experiences in the EuroBasket tournament. Unexpectedly, Doncic couldn't control himself in this crucial quarterfinal match, causing Slovenia to lose their ace player during a comeback attempt. The second technical foul was a result of his protest after not getting a foul call on a jump shot, and upon slow-motion review, it appeared that there was indeed room for the call. However, with six and a half minutes remaining in the game and a 15-point deficit, shouldn't he have quickly gotten up and returned to defense? Doncic chose to sit on the ground and complain, ultimately leading to his expulsion from the game. In NBA games, where entertainment value is paramount, referees may show some favoritism towards superstars, especially when it comes to technical fouls that could lead to their ejection, as it can frustrate fans when they can't see their favorite players in action. However, FIBA international competitions prioritize the game itself over ticket sales, so the referees' tolerance for complaints is lower, not higher. In a post-game interview, Doncic addressed the officiating, saying, "I admit that I haven't always controlled myself well, but a teammate told me that the referees won't blow the whistle just because I keep complaining." He expressed his belief that this was unfair. The report did not specify which teammate said this, nor did it mention which referee made such a comment. However, it is evident that Doncic is still upset with the referees. Apart from complaining about the referees, he also praised his opponent, Brooks, showing some sportsmanship. Doncic said, "Brooks, as always, used a lot of physicality in his defense. He played great! Many people may not like Brooks, but I have a lot of respect for him." Returning to the game itself, Slovenia was actually the team with the hot shooting hand. They made 15 three-pointers with a 48% shooting percentage. Despite Doncic's inconsistent shooting, he still had an impressive performance, making 4 out of 6 three-point attempts. The team as a whole scored 89 points, which is considered high. The first half of the game was evenly matched, with both teams tied at 50-50. However, in the second half, Slovenia started to lose their composure and allowed Canada to pull away. Canada had a dangerous shooting lineup, with five active NBA players among their top scorers. RJ Barrett, Brooks, and Dort were the primary targets for their outside shots. However, the poor shooting performance of the latter two, who only made 5 out of 9 three-point attempts, hurt their team. While RJ struggled from beyond the arc, he had an unusual perfect free-throw shooting performance, making all five attempts, and also had a 50% field goal shooting percentage, scoring a tournament-high of 24 points. He also contributed with his excellent athleticism, grabbing the second-highest number of rebounds for the team with nine, helping to protect the paint. Nickeil Alexander-Walker came off the bench and contributed 14 points, providing a boost to the team's firepower with his ability to score from both inside and outside. Kelly Olynyk, the team's center, only scored seven points, but his presence on the court significantly improved ball movement. When Olynyk was on the court, Canada outscored their opponents by 27 points, having the highest +/- value for the team. On the other hand, Doncic's Dallas Mavericks teammate, Dwight Powell, had a relatively quiet game, committing four fouls and not attempting any shots. He fulfilled his role as a hard worker for the team.
