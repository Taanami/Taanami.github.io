The Houston Rockets have started their preseason training camp after the disappointment of missing the playoffs last season. Star player James Harden, who has had a falling out with the team's general manager Daryl Morey, has publicly expressed his desire to be traded. It was rumored that he wanted to join the Los Angeles Clippers and form a superstar team with Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and Russell Westbrook, but no trade has materialized yet.

During the media day before the Sixers' training camp, Harden was absent, which only fueled the rumors of a potential trade. The question now is not whether Harden wants to leave, but whether Morey wants to keep him. It seems that a separation is inevitable.

However, even though the Sixers have a strong team, they may have trouble finding a trade partner for the 34-year-old superstar. Harden's absence during media day and the first day of training camp may have been a tactic to make the Sixers uncomfortable and push them to make a trade. Both sides want a separation, so why has it not happened yet? Let's discuss a few factors.

Firstly, the timing is not in favor of a trade. Most of the top teams in the league, such as the Nuggets, Suns, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, Bucks, Celtics, Heat, and Knicks, have already completed their roster before and after the potential Harden trade. It is now much harder to make a trade to a specific team, which was possible during the offseason. This is not an ideal situation for the Rockets.

Moreover, Harden has a specific team in mind that he wants to join. Being in the later stage of his career, he has already achieved many individual accolades and was even selected as one of the top 75 players in NBA history. He has also sacrificed his salary to help the Rockets improve their roster. However, he is still missing a championship ring, and he wants to join a team that has a chance to compete for a championship. This narrows down his potential trade destinations to only 5-8 teams.

Additionally, Harden also wants to return to his hometown to play, which leaves only the Lakers and the Clippers as options. However, the Lakers may not be interested in him after their failed attempt to pair him with Westbrook last season.

The Lakers have had a successful offseason, keeping their core players and making some significant additions. They have upgraded their roster with Christian Wood and Gabe Vincent, who are versatile and can play both inside and outside. They also have a strong backup center in Jaxson Hayes and potential young talents in Taurean Prince and Cam Reddish. With LeBron James and Anthony Davis leading the team, the Lakers have a strong chance of defeating the Nuggets, who are considered one of the top teams in the West.

The Lakers do not have a strong incentive to trade for Harden. The Rockets and other potential trade partners are in a similar situation, making it unlikely for any team to break up their team just a few weeks before the start of the season to make room for Harden. This is not an ideal situation for the Rockets.

For the Sixers, the decision to trade Harden depends on their championship aspirations and his value to the team. Their star player, Joel Embiid, still has four years left on his contract, while both Harden and Tobias Harris only have one year left. With their main competitors in the East improving their roster, it may be necessary for the Sixers to make a move to keep their championship hopes alive. However, trading Harden would mean losing a key player, and it would not be an easy decision.

The Sixers have to weigh their options carefully and make a decision that is in the best interest of the team. If they decide to trade Harden, they would need to get a fair return to make up for his absence. This is different from the Trail Blazers' trade of Lillard, where they had a long-term contract with him and could afford to wait for the right trade offer.

Harden's contract expires after this season, making it a crucial year for him. If the Sixers cannot find a suitable trade partner before the season ends, he could leave as a free agent, which would be detrimental to the team. It is better for the Sixers to make a decision now and part ways with Harden peacefully. This was also the case when they resolved the trade rumors surrounding Ben Simmons last year, which ultimately led to the arrival of Harden in Philadelphia.

The Sixers have stated that they are not looking to trade Harden, but recent reports of a strained relationship between the player and the team suggest otherwise. They are not actively seeking a trade, but if a suitable offer presents itself, they may consider it. After all, the team's success is their top priority. Let's wait and see where Harden will end up and how this situation will unfold.
