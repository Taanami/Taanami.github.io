  Slow Start: The Four Problems with the Knicks' Slow Offensive Attack 

In modern basketball, especially in today's NBA style of play, shooting ability is crucial. If a team has accurate outside shooting, it means high offensive efficiency and the ability to stretch the floor for more plays. On the other hand, if their outside shooting is off, the offensive efficiency naturally suffers.

However, the Knicks defied this norm last season, ranking only 20th in true shooting percentage, but still holding the 4th spot in offensive efficiency in the league.

In the past 27 years, only the 2021-22 Grizzlies were able to maintain a top-five offensive level when ranking in the bottom half in one of the four key offensive stats (effective field goal percentage, offensive rebound rate, free throw rate, turnover rate). Keep reading to find out how the Knicks were able to achieve such results, with top-ten rankings in the other three factors, especially in controlling turnovers (ranked 5th) and grabbing offensive rebounds (ranked 2nd).

1. Significant Drop in Efficiency 

However, the Knicks' current record of 4 wins and 4 losses shows a decrease of 9 points per 100 possessions compared to last season, the most drastic decrease in offensive efficiency in the entire league.

In their first five games of the season, the Knicks faced four teams that ranked in the top six in defensive performance last season â€“ the Cavaliers (1), Celtics (2), and Pelicans (6). Despite this tough schedule, other teams like the Trail Blazers and Grizzlies also faced challenges with key players leaving or being absent, but the Knicks have been leading the league in team stability since last year with only Obi Toppin leaving the team.

In addition, the Knicks have had good health throughout the team, with only RJ Barrett missing one game due to injury (against the Cavaliers). Keep reading for the second problem.

2. Same Strengths, Same Weaknesses 

In terms of offensive rebounding, the Knicks continue to excel in their strengths, ranking 2nd in offensive rebound rate, with Mitchell Robinson still dominating in offensive rebounds. It can be imagined that Evan Mobley must be relieved to not have to face Robinson for the next four months.

3. Lack of Finishing Ability in the Paint 

Although Robinson does not take many shots, his drop in shooting efficiency ranks 2nd among the Knicks' rotational players, from 67.1% to 48.0%.

This problem is more about how to finish scoring, rather than just shooting skills. Keep reading for the third problem. 

The top two players on the Knicks in terms of shots in the paint, Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle, have a combined field goal percentage of less than 40%, a significant decrease from last season's 56.7%.

4. Lack of Ball Movement 

As mentioned earlier, the season has just begun and the Knicks have only played 8 out of 82 games.

As time goes by, star-level players like Brunson and Randle will surely gradually improve, but the Knicks will continue to face the same issue of lack of ball movement. The Knicks rank 26th in passing flow and only make 299 passes per 24 minutes of possession time, with a distance of 11.1 miles traveled per 24 minutes, making them one of the five teams at the bottom of both rankings.

However, this has not changed much from last season, when the Knicks ranked 25th and 20th, respectively.

Ball movement does not necessarily correlate with offensive efficiency. In fact, some teams ranked lower than the Knicks, including the Celtics, Mavericks, and Clippers, currently have top-tier offensive efficiency in the league.

These teams have star players like Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Luka Doncic, Paul George, and Kawhi Leonard.

The Knicks have Brunson and Randle, but their efficiency in isolation has significantly decreased compared to last season. In theory, their isolation abilities should create more scoring opportunities for their teammates (including each other), but sometimes when they have an advantage (such as attracting two defenders), the ball does not continue to move after one pass, or Brunson and Randle still take many difficult shots even when their teammates are open. The positive performances of the Knicks' players on the court are still not enough, although they still use their strengths in games, including Brunson's driving and agility, Randle's aggressive style, and Robinson's rebounding advantage. But if the Knicks can use this as a foundation and incorporate more flexible passing while avoiding too many difficult shots, they are fully capable of making the game smoother. Especially with the Knicks' star isolation abilities and passing abilities, if they have the willingness and effort to share the ball, it will definitely improve their team's offense. On the defensive end, the Knicks are also performing well, ranking 2nd in team defensive efficiency and controlling rebounds. This has led to their opponents only scoring 100 points per 100 possessions, the second-lowest in the league.

The Knicks have a young and energetic lineup, and their offensive potential is still great. However, if they want to become a truly strong team, they need to continue to improve their offensive problems, especially in ball movement and efficiency. If they can maintain their excellent defensive performance, the Knicks will be an awe-inspiring team.
