Lillard's future has been playing out since the end of June, and it has been almost three months now. Although the Miami Heat have been identified as one of Lillard's potential destinations, there have been recent reports of other teams expressing interest in acquiring Lillard. The Toronto Raptors are recognized by the public as one of the teams vying for Lillard's joining.

According to reporter Matt Moore on the Locked on NBA podcast, several teams in the Eastern Conference are interested in acquiring Lillard, and the Raptors are one of the teams that have shown interest. While there is no discussion about whether the Raptors are actively pursuing Lillard, other teams have already acknowledged the Raptors' desire to trade for him. The Raptors have a track record of pursuing superstar players in the league, such as Kawhi Leonard, and they were able to secure their first-ever championship with him. The architect of that championship, Masai Ujiri, is still with the team. This season, the Raptors lost Fred VanVleet and although they signed Dennis Schroder, there is still a need for a point guard to some extent. 

On the other hand, there have been reports that the Miami Heat are not willing to offer a substantial package for Lillard, which can be seen as a challenge to the Portland Trail Blazers. It remains to be seen if the Blazers can find a better trade package in the market considering the offers available and Lillard's desire to join the Heat.
