Not only did they win the UBA Men's Level 1 Championship for three consecutive years, but the PCCU Eagles also won the WUBS Championship in Japan this year. In the first game of the inter-league basketball invitational tournament today, they defeated SBL representative Taiwan Bank with a score of 87:76, even without their "strongest foreign student" Mobaye. Even the new member of Taiwan Bank, Neumann, praised his "alma mater" for its improvement.

Neumann, who is 205cm tall and from Senegal, came to Taiwan for college and his first stop was PCCU. In his first season in the UBA, PCCU Eagles advanced to Men's Level 1. After helping the team win the championship in the 109th academic year, Neumann entered the 2021 PLG draft and was selected by the New Taipei Kings as the 7th pick in the first round. After two seasons with the Kings, he became a free agent this summer and officially joined Taiwan Bank in early September.

In today's inter-league game against his alma mater, Neumann believes that PCCU has improved year by year. "The current team is on a different level compared to when I was in school," he said. He pointed out that PCCU has a diverse offensive strategy, both inside and outside the paint, and plays with unity. However, he admitted that his own lack of attention to detail led to a 25:8 run by his alma mater in the third quarter. He believes that with better defense, they can still stop the younger players. After living in Taiwan for many years, Neumann can now speak some Chinese. He said that he is currently adjusting to his new teammates in Taiwan Bank and said in Chinese, "Take it slowly." He looks forward to performing well in the new season in the SBL.

Taiwan Bank head coach Chen Guowei is a member of the coaching staff for the Chinese men's basketball team at the Hangzhou Asian Games. Although he was present today, the team was managed by Xu Zhiqiang. Chen emphasized that today's defeat was "due to our own mistakes." The team failed to meet the set standards in both offense and defense. "Especially at the beginning of the third quarter, we allowed three three-pointers, and there were also many mistakes on offense. We couldn't maintain good ball movement and couldn't bring out the intensity. We didn't perform well ourselves, so the result is not surprising." PCCU relied on new foreign player Popoca as the main inside player today. Coach Chen Ziwei explained that Mobaye had some family issues and is expected to return on the 19th. This inter-league game against the soldiers is also a good opportunity to encourage the players to show their own attitude and style, and learn from the senior players on professional teams.
