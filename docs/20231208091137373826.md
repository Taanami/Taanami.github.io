Fortunately, the Thunder had a good performance in the first week of the season. They defeated the Bulls in their opener and then went on to face the Cavaliers on the road. With an 18-5 run in the final 2 minutes and 40 seconds, they came back to win their second consecutive game.

In their home opener, the Thunder faced the defending champions, the Nuggets, and suffered a 33-point loss. However, they quickly regrouped and defeated the Pistons the next day, finishing the week with 3 wins and 1 loss.

Looking back at the first game against the Bulls, both teams were neck and neck in the first three quarters with multiple lead changes. However, in the third quarter, the Thunder's guards were able to find open teammates on the perimeter, while the Bulls struggled with their outside shooting. In the fourth quarter, the Thunder pulled away with a series of three-pointers and secured the victory. In the next game against the Cavaliers, who were missing Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen, both teams had strong defensive performances, resulting in a low-scoring game. Despite Donovan Mitchell's 43 points for the Cavaliers, the Thunder managed to come back and win thanks to Luguentz Dort's three-pointer and Chet Holmgren's strong play on both ends of the court.

After two consecutive wins on the road, the Thunder returned home to face the Nuggets, but unfortunately suffered a blowout loss due to their poor perimeter shooting and the absence of key players such as SGA. However, they quickly bounced back the next day against the Pistons, with Dort and Holmgren leading the team to victory.

This week, we saw an improvement in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's playmaking skills, as he has been able to find open teammates with skip passes and make quick decisions. As a league leader in drives for three consecutive seasons, SGA continues to excel in this area, with 54 drives in the first two games, far ahead of second place Luka Doncic and De'Aaron Fox with 36. However, his free throw attempts have decreased significantly compared to last season, which is something he will need to work on.

Rookie Chet Holmgren has also made a strong debut, with his defensive abilities and outside shooting making him a perfect fit for the Thunder's system. Despite struggling against Nikola Vucevic and Andre Drummond in the first game, Chet has shown his versatility and impact on both ends of the court. With his 7-foot-6 wingspan and elite defensive awareness, he has been able to block multiple shots per game, ranking in the top three in the league. His offensive game has also been impressive, with double-digit scoring in all four games and a standout performance against the Nuggets with 29 points and 12 rebounds.

In conclusion, the Thunder had a solid performance in the first week of the season, despite some injury setbacks. The addition of Chet Holmgren has added a new dimension to their offense, and with the team's resilience, we can expect more success in the upcoming games.
