 No Longer the Essential Foundation for a Championship, James Harden Now Symbolizes Something Different

Whether James Harden successfully switches teams or stays with the Philadelphia 76ers, he must bring his best game in the upcoming season to show everyone that he is still a valuable player worth investing in. After opting into the final year of his contract, Harden requested a trade from the team, leaving everyone curious about his true intentions. Although the 76ers' starting lineup is not perfect, they have a strong overall team.

Continuing to read, as long as the reigning MVP Joel Embiid stays healthy, young star Tyrese Maxey continues to improve, Harden showcases his skills, and other players perform consistently, the 76ers have the potential to contend for a championship. Typically, a quasi-Hall of Fame player who is only missing a championship ring would not leave a team like this. However, Harden, who spent seven years as the leader of the Houston Rockets and was an MVP candidate during those years, might leave Philadelphia this summer. If he is traded, it would be his fourth team change in four years. Harden's frequency of team switches is almost comparable to that of his former Thunder teammate Westbrook, despite their contrasting playing styles.

Since leaving the Rockets, Harden has been traded to teams that were considered championship contenders, but he has never made it to the NBA Finals. So even if he is traded to the Los Angeles Clippers, a team that is expected to contend, it might not be beneficial for him.

Reports indicate that Philadelphia 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey explicitly told Harden that he hoped he would exercise his player option for the final year of his contract. It seems strange that Harden would still request a trade under these circumstances, especially when there is a chance to acquire superstar Damian Lillard through a trade this summer. Perhaps this move is to hold more bargaining power in a potential Harden trade (to improve his trade value by making his relationship with the team appear less strained), and the 76ers still hope that if they continue to work together next season, Harden will be willing to give his all.

Continuing to read, theoretically, players should always give their all on the court, but Harden has had a history of displaying a lack of effort.

During his final days with the Rockets, he went four consecutive games without scoring more than 20 points. This was something that had never happened in his previous eight years with the Rockets. Even though Harden said in an interview, "I've given everything I have, and I don't think this situation is unsolvable, it's too crazy," it was clear that he wanted the Rockets to trade him.

Even if Harden is unable to land on another team, the situation with the 76ers is different from his time with the Rockets. In the new season, we can still expect to see Harden playing seriously because he has no choice.

With only one year left on his contract and turning 34 soon, he must give his all on the court. There were rumors that he wanted the team to offer him a long-term and high-paying contract, but reports suggest that the 76ers are not willing to do so, which has left Harden frustrated with the team.

Continuing to read, in the upcoming offseason, there may be teams willing to offer him a big contract, similar to the three-year, $126 million deal with a player option in the final year that the Dallas Mavericks offered Kyrie Irving. However, the key is for Harden to give his all in the last year of his current contract so that he can become a coveted player in the market and have a chance to secure a bigger contract.

There is no doubt that Harden still possesses great skills. Last season, he averaged 21 points per game and became the assist leader with an average of 10.7 assists per game. He should have been selected for the All-Star Game last season, but the team needs him to perform consistently in every game, not just have a few explosive performances, especially during the playoffs.

In the second round of last season's playoffs, when Embiid missed the first game, Harden scored an impressive 45 points in a single game. In the fifth game of that series, he scored 42 points. However, excluding these two games, he only scored a total of 67 points in the other six games of the series. The 76ers were heavily defeated in the seventh game against the Celtics, and Harden's stats for that game were 9 points, 7 assists, 5 turnovers, with a plus-minus value of -30.

If he ultimately stays with the 76ers, they will undoubtedly lose out, especially if they have the opportunity to acquire Lillard through a reasonable trade, as Lillard would be a better choice. However, the 76ers might not be able to acquire Lillard in a trade. In such a scenario, the team must not let the situation with Harden become too strained and ensure that he is willing to give his all in the final year of his contract.

As for Harden, despite his dissatisfaction with the team, for his personal interests, it is believed that he will still strive to perform well in the new season to earn his next contract.
