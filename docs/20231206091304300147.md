 穿NIKE的耶穌！飛人喬丹，時代肖像：Jordan的北卡歲月（九）

After scoring the winning shot in the NCAA championship game, Michael Jordan's life changed forever. In his sophomore year, Jordan showed a different side of himself, filled with confidence and a newfound understanding of his own abilities. He realized that he could be more than just a good player, he could be great.

Before the official start of the North Carolina men's basketball season, there were a few weeks dedicated to scrimmages between new and returning players, as well as alumni. Even NBA player James Worthy, who was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers, came back to participate. Jordan's former teammates were impressed by how much he had changed. Even when playing against NBA level players, Jordan showed no fear and was able to score on them.

Jordan's confidence now matched his physical abilities. He seemed to have broken through a barrier and realized that he could be more than just good, he could be great. His teammates, including Steve Hale and Matt Doherty, noticed that he had a target-oriented mindset, even in informal scrimmages. Typically, players try to showcase their strengths and hide their weaknesses in these games, but Jordan did the opposite. He worked on improving his weaknesses during these scrimmages. His athleticism improved even further, and he even grew taller, measuring in at 6'6" in his sophomore year.

Jordan's physical talents were something that could not be taught, but what impressed the coaches was his passion and coachability. He absorbed everything around him like a sponge, as his senior teammate James Worthy put it. This was a result of his hard work and determination, which made his coach Dean Smith very proud. Smith continued to help Jordan improve, showing him tapes of his own games and pointing out areas where he could improve. He reminded Jordan that defense was what ultimately won games, and encouraged him to work on that aspect of his game.

This idea took root in Jordan's mind, and he began to enjoy shutting down his opponents on defense, even more than scoring on them. His dramatic improvement caught the attention of NBA coach Billy Cunningham, who watched a North Carolina practice and told Smith that Jordan could potentially be the greatest player in the history of the program. However, Smith, who was fiercely protective of Jordan, did not like hearing this. He believed in treating all players equally and didn't want Jordan to be singled out. He quickly responded to Cunningham, saying that they had many great players and Jordan was just one of them.

But even Smith had to admit that Jordan was better than the others. He possessed an extraordinary talent for basketball, but also had a relentless work ethic. He also became more vocal on the court, especially in the one-on-one scrimmages in practice. No one wanted to guard Jordan, as they knew that if they lost to him, their name would be written on the whiteboard in the locker room with a number next to it, representing the number of times Jordan dunked on them during the scrimmage.

The legend of Michael Jordan continued to grow during his time at North Carolina, where he not only showcased his incredible talents, but also his determination and fierce competitiveness.
