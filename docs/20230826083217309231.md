 Pre-match analysis of Group B in the 2023 Basketball World Cup: China, Serbia, South Sudan, and Puerto Rico.

South Sudan is the most mysterious team among all 32 teams in the World Cup and has the potential to be a disruptive force. Established in 2013, South Sudan only played its first official international game in 2017. Led by former NBA player Luol Deng, the team has recruited players with South Sudanese heritage from around the world. The team's players are mainly descendants of the Dinka tribe, known for their long limbs and exceptional athleticism. While lacking experience and strength compared to European powerhouses, South Sudan has a chance to secure victories against lower-ranked teams and represent Africa in the Paris Olympics next year.

Puerto Rico, one of the shortest teams in the World Cup, relies heavily on their guards to establish a fast-paced style of play. Tremont Waters, a former NBA player, is the team's main player. Despite his small stature, Waters consistently contributes to Puerto Rico's offense with his skills. The team also has a solid frontcourt to counter opponents known for their physique. George Conditt IV and Ismael Romero are the main interior players for Puerto Rico. However, the team faces a tough challenge in their group as their opponents have taller and stronger players. Puerto Rico needs to play to their strengths and avoid being dominated in the paint.

China, as the host of the previous World Cup, failed to qualify for the Olympics, disappointing many Chinese fans. This year, China has a new coach, Aleksandar Djordjevic, and a naturalized player, Kyle Anderson. The team has a balanced roster, and the addition of Anderson brings versatility. However, the absence of injured player Guo Ailun may affect their backcourt depth. China's key player is Anderson, who can contribute in various aspects of the game. Other players like Zhang Zhenlin, Zhou Qi, and Cui Yongxi are expected to make significant contributions. With Djordjevic's coaching and Anderson's presence, China aims to represent Asia in the Paris Olympics.

Serbia, ranked 6th in the world, is known for its deep pool of talented players. Although they are missing Nikola Jokic in this World Cup, they still have NBA players Bogdan Bogdanovic and Nikola Jovic. Serbia's style of play emphasizes ball movement and involves the frontcourt players in decision-making. Despite the absence of Jokic and Vasilije Micic, Serbia remains a strong contender in their group. Their main challenge may come from South Sudan, who play an unpredictable style of basketball.
