 According to reporter Shams Charania, Memphis Grizzlies guard Marcus Smart injured his left ankle in the last game against the Lakers when he landed on an opponent's foot while jumping, forcing him to leave the court. The results of the examination showed that he would need to rest for at least 3-5 weeks. This is a big blow to the Grizzlies, who have already lost Ja Morant for 25 games due to suspension and Steven Adams for the entire season. Smart's return is estimated to be around the same time that Morant will be able to play. The Grizzlies currently have a record of 2 wins and 9 losses, ranking last in the Western Conference.
