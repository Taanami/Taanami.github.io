 The PLG Yulon Luxgen Dinos and Jason Washburn have completed their contract renewal. The team hopes to achieve more success in the upcoming season.

Washburn, the center from last season, has played in 26 regular season games, with an average playing time of 33 minutes and a field goal percentage of over 50%. He has averaged 21.3 points and 10.6 rebounds per game, playing a crucial role in the team's ten-game winning streak. After the end of last season, the team actively negotiated with Washburn on contract renewal and recently completed the signing of the contract.

Washburn said, "I can't wait to return to the court and win every game for the Yulon Luxgen Dinos. I am also very happy to fight with the Orange Army again." The team stated, "Washburn is a player who balances rationality and emotion. In addition to his excellent basketball skills, we believe that all Orange Army members will not forget the tears he shed when the team lost in the last season. This kind of winning spirit and pride are driving the team's growth. We are very happy that Washburn can return, and we believe his addition will help the Yulon Luxgen Dinos achieve more success."
