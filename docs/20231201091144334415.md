With an 80:71 win over Taiwan Beer, they secured their second consecutive victory. Lin Ping-Sheng, who has scored the highest for two days in a row, attributed the team's success to the team as a whole, emphasizing that there is no top player on the team.

Despite facing a contract dispute with PLG Hsinchu Street Lions, Lin Ping-Sheng was not affected on the court. In the first half, the War Gods were still trailing 33:36. With 5 and a half minutes left in the third quarter, they launched an 11:1 offensive to take the lead. Lin Ping-Sheng scored 9 points in this offensive. In the final quarter, Taiwan Beer found their rhythm, with Yang Tian-You and Wang Xin-Wei's consecutive three-pointers helping the team regain the lead. In the last 23 seconds, Taiwan Beer's guard Cao Xun-Xiang was called out, and Wang Hao-Ji made a free throw before hitting a last-second three-pointer from the corner, allowing Taiwan Beer to lead 58:51 at the end of the third quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, the War Gods scored 29 points and completed a comeback victory over Taiwan Beer. Lin Ping-Sheng has scored the highest in two consecutive games and with his current popularity, he has the aura of a team's top player. War Gods' American head coach Brian Adams also said that Lin Ping-Sheng has a leadership presence off the court and his dominance on the court can inspire his teammates. He is definitely an important player on the team and one of the leaders. However, we are a team and we don't emphasize individual players. Everyone can lead the team.

Lin Ping-Sheng agreed and said that every teammate is important. "A good team doesn't have a top player. If a team only has one top player, they can't win a championship." He also named each teammate, including Liu Yan-Ting's defense, Lin Li-Quan's pressure on the court, and Cao Xun-Xiang's leadership. Everyone played a crucial role in today's comeback victory and he hopes that they can continue to showcase their strengths and help the team.

Cao Xun-Xiang, who received a technical foul today, played for Taiwan Beer's Yulon last season. He said that there is no animosity playing against his former teammates, but he has some opinions on the unfavorable calls from the referees. He admitted that he may have overreacted, leading to his ejection. He also mentioned that the new coach has only been with the team for about two weeks and they haven't had much time to work on team chemistry. Right now, they are just playing the game and need to continue to build chemistry with their new teammates.
