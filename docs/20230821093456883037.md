  Chaos in the Chinese men's basketball team: The lack of point guard remains a persistent problem

In the game between the Chinese national team and their opponents in the Jones Cup last night, despite maintaining a lead throughout the game and winning by a 17-point margin, it is undeniable that there were deviations in both offense and defense.

With injuries to key backup point guards, Coach Sonny Sandoval decided to have Lin Tingqian and Wu Yongsheng fill in, and even had Zeng Wendong assist from the sidelines. This move was meant to test whether this would become the team's biggest disadvantage in the upcoming Asian Games. Let's analyze further.

This year, the Chinese team was divided into four groups, utilizing resources from overseas, the three major leagues, and college basketball to successfully form a team with potential and strength. The first-line team, which mainly focuses on preparing for the Asian Games, is the Chinese national team in the Jones Cup. The recruitment process went smoothly, but injuries quietly became a hidden concern, preventing the team from being at full strength. From the exhibition games in Japan to the start of the Jones Cup, injuries to the point guards have been a constant issue. Lin Wei-han underwent surgery and withdrew, Chen Ying-jun underwent surgery and rested, and Li Kai-yan and Zhou Guiyu recently withdrew from training due to injuries. This has affected the overall tactical operation and rhythm control of the team.

Although the Chinese team's lineup in the Jones Cup has a good balance of offense and defense, there are still many players who lack experience. From the establishment of the team, it has been evident that they need a leader to take charge. While it is unfortunate that players are getting injured, it is not their fault. It is difficult to compete in a long season without injuries. The severity of the injuries and whether they will affect continuous participation in games are the main concerns. Coach Sonny Sandoval, who has inherited the Charlie Parker system, sees the point guard as the regulator of the team's pace, the most important position outside the paint. The current predicament is evident, and he has expressed in multiple interviews the impact this has brought. We hope that they can recover from their injuries and contribute to the team's success in the Asian Games. Before the Jones Cup, Coach Sandoval mentioned that Lin Tingqian would play the point guard position, with Wu Yongsheng replacing Li Kai-yan and Zhou Guiyu. However, due to the withdrawal of the Olympic men's basketball pre-qualification tournament, Wei Jiahao, Lin Bingsheng, and Zhang Jiahe were added to the team to inject fresh energy into the backcourt, hoping to achieve the desired results in the games.

Fans can read the article "The Overlay Effect of the New and Old Systems: The Influence Brought by Coach Sonny Sandoval" on the website, which discusses the system operation of the Chinese national team in the Jones Cup. Since the exhibition games in Japan, the biggest change has been the shift in the ball-dominant core, from focusing on the backcourt to achieving a balance. This allows players in the fourth and fifth positions to have the ball in their hands, with the frontcourt running and creating offensive opportunities or stretching the defense to attack the rim. This helps alleviate the pressure of lacking a point guard.

In the first four games, Lin Tingqian and Wu Yongsheng played the point guard position, while Zeng Wendong acted as the invisible playmaker. They each had three assists in two games, leaving the rhythm of the game in their hands.

Looking at the performances of the Chinese team in each game, in the first game against the Philippines, they recorded 24 assists, mostly concentrated in the backcourt and on Li Dewei. The main focus was on fast breaks and half-court offensive strategies. In the second game against Japan, Wu Yongsheng took charge of the point guard position, but the frontcourt had strong offensive energy, running fast and attracting double teams to create open shots. Liu Zheng and Abass combined for 10 assists, proving that both teams were not strong, and they didn't face many difficulties.

In the game against Qatar two days ago, Lin Tingqian and Zeng Wendong took control of the ball. They used pick-and-roll plays and high-low positioning, allowing Atyanov to shoot with a 75% field goal percentage. Lin Tingqian scored in the first half and assisted in the second half, stabilizing the offensive and defensive rhythm and preventing the opponent's counterattacks. Yesterday's game against Iran was chaotic, with a total of 16 assists, the lowest in the four games. Apart from Zeng Wendong's solid half-court play, most of the offense relied on strong attacks from the frontcourt. The ball movement was not smooth, and there were even moments where it was hard to see any organization, resulting in deviations in the game. From the above observations, it can be seen that the Chinese team no longer heavily relies on the point guard for ball possession and offense. Instead, they focus on strong defense and transitioning from offense to defense. They develop their offense in two areas: the backcourt and pick-and-roll plays with Atyanov, as well as high-low positioning in the paint. In terms of assists, fast breaks are still more prominent than half-court plays. Depending on the opponent and the lineup, the ball-dominant axis is distributed across different positions, showcasing a versatile lineup.

Please continue reading ▼ Individual breakthroughs are still stronger than group collaboration, and half-court offense is not easy to execute. First and foremost, it must be emphasized that the teams in the Jones Cup are not top-tier, so it is not difficult for the Chinese team to win. Therefore, the focus should be on the content of the games and how the team adjusts as a whole. Indeed, without a strong point guard on the court, the organization and system heavily rely on the players' performance on that day. If they are playing well, they can control the rhythm, but if not, it can become chaotic. This is the dilemma facing the Chinese team. (1) Is it a waste to have Lin Tingqian play as a point guard? Lin Tingqian is the best physically conditioned player among the top three in the CBA. He has a variety of offensive moves and is strong in one-on-one situations. He can be considered the Chinese team's most powerful weapon. While he mainly plays as a shooting guard in the league, he also has experience playing as a point guard. However, organizing the team is not his natural inclination. Therefore, playing him as a point guard is a last resort. Coach Sonny Sandoval mentioned that it was a difficult decision but a relatively secure configuration. I support this decision, as there are no other options and Lin Tingqian's ability to play as a combo guard would be beneficial for his future development. By not solely focusing on offense and expanding the team's effectiveness, the key is to find the right balance between his attack and organization skills to maximize his impact.
