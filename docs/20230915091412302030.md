 The Denver Nuggets, in their 47th year in the NBA, defeated the Miami Heat with a final score of 94-89, led by Nikola Jokic's 28 points and 16 rebounds, along with Michael Porter Jr.'s 16 points and 13 rebounds in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. With a 4-1 victory in the championship series, the Nuggets claimed their first-ever NBA title in franchise history. The 7-game series, played in the United States, followed a 4-win format. The Nuggets returned to their home court with a 3-1 advantage and secured the championship against the Miami Heat.

Tyler Herro, who averaged 20.1 points per game for the Heat and was their second-leading scorer, suffered a right hand fracture and underwent surgery after the first playoff game against the Milwaukee Bucks. He made his return in the do-or-die game for the Heat. The Heat started the game with a 5-0 lead, but the Nuggets quickly responded with a 12-0 run.

Despite falling behind by 8 points at one point, the Heat managed to take the lead in the first quarter with Bam Adebayo's consecutive three-point plays, leading 24-22. The Nuggets struggled from beyond the three-point line in the first half, making only one of their 15 attempts. Adebayo's 18 points helped the Heat maintain a 51-44 lead at halftime.

In the third quarter, the Nuggets tied the game at 60-60 with Jamal Murray's three-pointer. The two teams battled back and forth, with Porter Jr.'s three-pointer giving the Nuggets the lead, and Kyle Lowry's three-pointer regaining the lead for the Heat. The Heat held a slim 71-70 lead at the end of the third quarter.

In the final quarter, the Nuggets took the lead after Jokic's basket and extended it to a 7-point lead. However, the Heat, led by Jimmy Butler's 5 consecutive points, regained the lead. With 27 seconds left and the Heat trailing 89-90, they made a crucial mistake, resulting in a turnover. The Nuggets made all four of their free throws, securing a 5-point victory.

With a 4-1 series win against the Heat, the Nuggets claimed their first NBA championship since joining the league in 1976. Jokic finished the game with 28 points and 16 rebounds, while Murray contributed 14 points and 8 assists. For the Heat, Butler scored a team-high 21 points, and Adebayo had 20 points and 12 rebounds. However, the Heat's overall rebounding disadvantage, with 50 rebounds compared to the Nuggets' 71, proved to be a significant factor.

Looking back at the Nuggets' history, they went through a 5-year dark rebuilding period before Jokic, Murray, and coach Malone led them to become the second team to win an NBA championship after the ABA-NBA merger. The American Basketball Association (ABA), founded in 1967, and the National Basketball Association (NBA), founded in 1946, were in competition until the ABA merged with the NBA in 1976. Only four ABA teams remained in the NBA, including the Nuggets, Brooklyn Nets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs.

The Nuggets have consistently made it to the playoffs, both in the ABA and NBA. In the ABA, they made the playoffs in all nine seasons but reached the Finals only once. After joining the NBA, the Nuggets made the playoffs nine times in the 1980s and had a ten-season playoff streak from 2004 to 2013. However, they never won a championship. Despite a five-year rebuilding period starting in the 2013-14 season, the Nuggets quietly laid the foundation for their success.

The acquisition of Jokic in 2014, Murray in 2016, and Porter Jr. in 2018, along with the hiring of Malone as coach in 2015, finally paid off in the 2018-19 season when they finished with a 54-28 record, securing the second seed in the Western Conference.

Throughout their 47-year history, the Nuggets have had many notable players, including Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, and Carmelo Anthony. With coach George Karl, known for his offensive style, the Nuggets played an exciting brand of basketball in the early 2000s, known for their high-scoring games.

Since moving to the Pepsi Center in 1999, the Nuggets' home court advantage has been attributed to the high altitude of Denver, which sits at 5,280 feet above sea level. Jokic, who was initially overweight when he entered the NBA, transformed himself into a dominant force on the court after adopting a healthier lifestyle and shedding excess weight. He has now earned the title of MVP.

Jokic, a 28-year-old Serbian center, was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft with the 41st overall pick. He had an outstanding performance from the beginning of his NBA career, earning a spot on the All-Rookie First Team. Despite his initially heavier build compared to other players, Jokic's scoring and rebounding averages have steadily increased over the years, reaching 20.1 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in the 2019-20 season, with a slight decline in the following season.
