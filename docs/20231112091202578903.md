  PLG's Lulu Lu and Fubon Reach Agreement for Early Departure

Fubon Braves announced today (2nd) that they have reached an agreement with player Lulu Lu to end their contract early. Lu signed a two-year contract with Fubon Braves in September last year and showed excellent assist skills during the 2022-23 P. LEAGUE+ season, providing crucial help to his teammates in key moments. He also made the most of every opportunity on the court and demonstrated a strong and tenacious fighting spirit. However, due to personal career development considerations, the contract was terminated early by mutual agreement.

Chris, the leader of Fubon Braves, expressed his gratitude for Lu's contribution and effort to the team. This year, they won a championship together, and he believes that Lu will have even more room to shine on the basketball court in the future. He also wishes him all the best in his basketball career.
