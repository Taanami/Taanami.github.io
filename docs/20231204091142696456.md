The Taiwan Beer Yulon Leopards, now known as T1 League, made their debut in a preseason game today, losing by 4 points to the Kaohsiung Family Mart Seahawks. Among the team's two major local talents, Chiang Yu-An and Lin Hsin-Kuan, who just won the 3x3 gold medal at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, it was evident that they were still trying to find their synergy with the team. Chiang Yu-An also revealed that after joining T1 and Yulon, and moving to a new environment, he is naturally a bit shy and needs some time to adapt.

T1 and Yulon announced their collaboration during the offseason this year, with players such as Chiang Yu-An, Li Chi-Wei, and Huang Chen joining the T1 Yulon Leopards. However, Chiang Yu-An went to play in the Chinese NBL during the offseason, only returning on the 12th to join the team's training. With limited training time, he was still trying to find his chemistry with his new teammates and foreign players, ultimately contributing 9 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists. When asked about his performance in the first preseason game, Chiang Yu-An said, "I just joined the team, so I still need to get familiar with my teammates' characteristics, especially the foreign players. Plus, my condition is not that great, so I need to adjust slowly.

"I'm still a rookie now, having only trained twice. There are a lot of new tactics, playing style, coaches, and teammates that I need to integrate into quickly."

Regarding the decision to merge T1 and Yulon, Chiang Yu-An honestly said that he spent the first 9 seasons of his career in the Taiwan Beer system, and when he first heard the news, he did feel a bit sudden and was not mentally prepared. "But I also told myself that this is basketball, and I have to adapt to the new environment as soon as possible. However, I am a bit shy, so it will take some time for me to get used to it." As for Lin Hsin-Kuan, who just won the 3x3 basketball gold medal for our country at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, he also joined the team's training recently and scored 3 points and 4 rebounds today. With both key local players joining the training for a short time, national team player Li Chi-Wei will not join until next Wednesday. T1 Yulon Leopards head coach Michael Olson said, "Everyone wants to know how our two teams will integrate, but we won't have the first training with the full team until next Wednesday when Chi-Wei returns. So I can't answer that question right now."
