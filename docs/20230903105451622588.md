  The Educational Significance of the 2023 Jones Cup is Greater than Basketball: Russell Turner's Coaching Philosophy

"This isn't my first time here," said Russell Turner slowly. After a three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Jones Cup returned this year, inviting the University of California Irvine (UCI) to represent the United States. Turner, who has been coaching at UCI since 2010, set foot on the island once again. The last time he was here, as Turner mentioned, was 27 years ago in 1996. That year, the Jones Cup also had a team from the United States, consisting of stars from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) of the NCAA. Turner, who was then an assistant coach at Wake Forest University, accompanied the US team as an assistant coach. Please continue reading.

Since this is not Turner's first time participating in the Jones Cup, he has a deep understanding of the competition and schedule. Although it may not be a tournament with points and official records, it is still a special and meaningful challenge for NCAA teams to have teams from various Asian countries participating. "Playing eight games in nine days, just like playing eleven games in twelve days back then, is a very intense schedule that puts us to the test. In mid-August, many universities in the US have already started their new semester, but UCI is still on vacation due to scheduling, so it is the perfect time for us to have this training before the start of the school year."

About two months before the Jones Cup, UCI had already announced on the university's website that their basketball team would participate. NCAA regulations allow each school to have an international program once every four years, and UCI chose the Jones Cup as their journey this time. "Many people in the NCAA only watch American basketball," Turner said. "The United States is certainly the best country in basketball, but basketball is not limited to one style. Different countries, different talents, and different strategies require NCAA players to learn in order to understand how basketball operates in various ways."

Although UCI started the Jones Cup with three victories, scoring over a hundred points and winning by more than 60 points in each game, Turner believes that this does not mean they are a superpower far superior to other teams or that UCI finds the Jones Cup unchallenging. "Many of our players are seeing how Asian teams play for the first time. In fact, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and other teams played better as the tournament went on. The content that beat us on the first day may not truly reflect their strength. We just had enough manpower this time and were able to change strategies based on the game situation. We performed very well in the Jones Cup, even better than I expected. That's why we won."

UCI brought a roster of 17 players to the Jones Cup this time. Turner stated that they usually maintain a squad of 16 players for the school team, but they brought an extra player this time to meet the depth requirements for intensive games and to adapt to different countries' tactics. Among the six players over 205 cm, four are over 210 cm, which exceeded Turner's original plan for a lineup with at least two players on the court, maintaining a "twin tower" formation. However, Turner changed the formation to one big and four small players when he believed that space on the court and defensive matchups were more important. The forwards performed well and met his expectations, which was the best aspect of their performance in the Jones Cup.

Over twenty years ago, when Turner was an assistant coach at Wake Forest University, he later moved to Stanford from 2000 to 2004. In 2004, he joined the NBA's Golden State Warriors as an assistant coach before leaving the NBA and becoming the head coach at UCI in 2010. For Turner, although the title of head coach is higher than that of an assistant coach, the educational significance that a university coach can bring is more important than professional basketball. "Compared to professional basketball, college coaches can have a greater influence on players. College players may not be mature, but college coaches don't necessarily have to immediately help players get better contracts. Instead, they can help them grow from boys to better men through their presence on the court. Of course, I still need to help the team win in college, but if I can help players become better individuals and bring more positive energy to them and their environment, that would be an achievement as a college coach," Turner said.

In Turner's philosophy, winning is certainly important in basketball. Whether it's his original twin tower formation or the lineup with the tallest starting lineup in NCAA history at 7 feet 6 inches and the shortest at 6 feet 8 inches, Turner wants to convey more than just winning to his players. "When I first came to UCI, there wasn't a single player taller than me (6 feet 7 inches). We played fast, like Asian teams. Now, I usually play with two big men and we can still win. What I want to say is that basketball is always related to physique and skills. You can have an advantage because of a better physique or better skills than others, but the most beautiful thing on the basketball court is that you always have different ways to become better. As long as you specialize in your own path to success, you can make wonderful things come true."
