  Summary of Minnesota Timberwolves' delayed preseason after one year

After a busy offseason, the Minnesota Timberwolves ended their ten-year undefeated preseason with a successful performance, both on paper and on the court.

Despite the salary cap concerns caused by Jaden McDaniels' $136 million contract, the team's main focus is still on solving the issue of having two dominant players on the court.

Coach Chris Finch has repeatedly emphasized the importance of half-court positioning and tactical execution, rather than relying on fast-paced and unpredictable offense like in the past. This change is aimed at creating a unique system for the team.

In the preseason games, players showed an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, and were able to effectively execute the team's half-court offense. This could be attributed to the experience gained by the six players who participated in the FIBA World Cup. The team's pace and assist numbers have also improved, showing the success of Finch's emphasis on half-court offense.

Moving on to the game strategies, the team will focus on utilizing the high post and creating opportunities for players like Ant and Conley to cut to the basket. Players like NAW and Big-Mac have also shown great cutting skills, making them valuable assets in breaking through the opponent's defense.

The success of the team's offense in the upcoming season will heavily rely on Karl-Anthony Towns' composure and decision-making abilities. He will need to prove that he can adapt to the new system and not disrupt the team's offensive rhythm. However, there were also some concerning moments, such as when Towns struggled in low post situations against the Knicks and when Ant had difficulty scoring against Caruso and Gobert. These issues will need to be addressed and improved upon in the regular season.

On the defensive end, the addition of Rudy Gobert has greatly improved the team's defensive efficiency. However, there are concerns about his tendency to stick to his comfort zone and not adjust to different defensive strategies. It will be crucial for him to be more versatile and adapt to different situations in order to have a positive impact on the team's chemistry and offensive execution.

In conclusion, the Timberwolves have made progress in both their offensive and defensive strategies in the preseason. However, there are still areas that need improvement and adjustments, which will be observed in the upcoming regular season.
