Taiwan Beer, who was behind by half in the first half, was led by "Sun Wukong" Lin Bing-Sheng, who scored 24 points in the Cross-League Basketball Invitational Tournament today. They made a comeback in the second half and defeated Taiwan Beer 80:71, securing their second consecutive win. Lin Bing-Sheng, who had the highest score for the team for two consecutive days, attributed the victory to the team and stressed that there is no "best player" on the team. Despite facing contract disputes with PLG Hsinchu Street's "Lion of Attack", Lin Bing-Sheng remained unfazed on the court. In the first half, the God of War was still behind with a score of 33:36. In the first five and a half minutes of the third quarter, they made an 11:1 offensive to take the lead, with Lin Bing-Sheng scoring 9 points in this aggressive attack.

In the final quarter, Taiwan Beer found their rhythm, with Yang Tian-You and Wang Xin-Wei's consecutive three-pointers giving them an advantage. However, in the last 23 seconds, Taiwan Beer's guard Cao Xun-Xiang was called out again, and Wang Hao-Ji made a free throw and a buzzer-beating three-pointer from the bottom corner, allowing Taiwan Beer to lead 58:51 after the third quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, the God of War scored 29 points and made a comeback, defeating Taiwan Beer. Lin Bing-Sheng was the highest scorer for two consecutive games and his popularity is currently high, giving off the aura of a "best player" on the team. The God of War's American head coach Brian Adams also said that Lin Bing-Sheng has leadership qualities off the court and his dominance on the court can inspire his teammates. He is indeed an important player on the team and one of the leaders. However, he also emphasized that they are a team and do not focus on individuals. Everyone can lead the team.

Lin Bing-Sheng agreed, saying that every teammate is important. "A good team does not have a best player. If a team only has one best player, it will not be able to win a championship."

He also mentioned his teammates, including Liu Yan-Ting's defense, Lin Li's full-court press, and Cao Xun-Xiang's momentum. Everyone played a crucial role in today's comeback win. He hopes that they can continue to play to their strengths and help the team. Cao Xun-Xiang, who received a technical foul today, played for Taiwan Beer's "Bear of England" last season. He said that there is no anger when facing his former teammates, but he does have some opinions on the unfavorable calls made by the referees. He only reacted strongly because of the unfair calls, leading to his ejection. He also mentioned that the new head coach joined the team only two weeks ago, so they haven't had much time to work on team chemistry. They are currently playing based on instinct, and they still need to continue to gel with their new teammates.
