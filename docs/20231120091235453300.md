  Hangzhou Asian Games: Despite natural talent difference, Chinese team defeats Chinese Taipei

In the previous game, Chinese Taipei easily defeated Hong Kong, but in their second game of the group stage at the Hangzhou Asian Games, they faced a tough challenge against the host team China. From the first quarter, they fell behind by double digits, and although they gradually recovered in the second quarter and narrowed the gap to 9 points, China extended their lead again after the break and won the game by 20 points, handing Chinese Taipei their first loss of the tournament.

In a post on Instagram, basketball blogger @basketball_biji discussed the team's poor execution of tactics as the main reason for their defeat, despite the common belief that the gap in natural talent and lack of a strong point guard were to blame. When facing a taller and stronger opponent like China, it is crucial for Chinese Taipei to utilize their speed advantage to the fullest and create mismatches on the court. They had successfully demonstrated this strategy at the Chengdu Universiade earlier this year when they faced China in the group stage. However, in this game at the Hangzhou Asian Games, their attempts to use tactics like "Flex" to force China to switch defenders did not work as well. They spent a lot of time setting screens and cutting, but still could not create open shots, resulting in a never-ending cycle of one-on-one plays. Against China's strong defense, Chinese Taipei's players were not efficient in their individual efforts, with Lin Ting-chien and Liu Chen shooting less than 40% and only scoring a combined 18 points. Although William Joseph Artino scored 20 points, most of them came from tough physical plays. It is not fair to say that the execution of tactics by this team is worse than that of the team in the Universiade, as it is a relative measure and cannot be judged solely based on the result. The higher the level of defense they face, the more challenging it is to execute tactics effectively.

Clearly, Chinese Taipei's tactics were not strong enough to overcome China's adult-level defense.

One possible explanation for this could be the recent change in coaching staff, with coach Samuel Sun replacing Charlie Parker. The players may still need time to adapt to the new system, and the short preparation time before the tournament may have affected their chemistry and understanding of tactics.

If players like Chen Ying-jun, Lin Wei-han, and Lee Kai-yen were healthy and able to play, they could have helped with the team's organization and control of the pace. However, the execution of tactics requires teamwork and a deep understanding of the tactics, which cannot be solved simply by adding more point guards. It will take time and effort to improve through training.

Another aspect to consider is the team's personnel and tactics configuration. As discussed in a previous article, since coach Sun took over the team, there has been an increase in the number of plays that rely on tall players to initiate the offense. However, in this game against China, their perimeter defense was aggressive, making it difficult for Chinese Taipei's guards to receive passes and creating a stagnant offense. This is especially problematic when most of their tall players lack the skills to attack from the perimeter, and they struggle to find open players or create shots for themselves, resulting in a low efficiency offense.

To minimize the disadvantage in size, Chinese Taipei usually plays with two tall players on the court at the same time. However, when their power forwards and centers are not effective on offense, the coaching staff could consider using a "small-ball" lineup, with players like Lee Chi-wei playing as a stretch four. After all, the coaching staff has used Tseng Hsiang-chun as a sharpshooter, so it may be better to replace him with a player with a higher three-point shooting percentage to speed up ball movement and create more open shots.

Chinese Taipei's defense in the paint was commendable, as Artino did a decent job of containing China's Wang Zhelin and even drew two offensive fouls from him. Although they were out-rebounded by 18, they only allowed China to score 17 points from second-chance opportunities, showing that they did not rely solely on their size to defend. However, their lack of focus was evident, as they were beaten by Zhang Zhenlin's baseline cuts multiple times and were slow to rotate on defense in transition, allowing China to score 18 fastbreak points compared to their 7. When facing a more talented opponent, it is crucial to maintain the basics and play at their own level to have a chance at winning. If they cannot even do that, narrowing the gap in natural talent is out of the question.

Therefore, before discussing the difference in natural talent between Chinese Taipei and China, it may be more important to focus on their teamwork, focus on defense, and other fundamental aspects.
