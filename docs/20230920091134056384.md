 NBA player Jermaine O'Neal expressed his disappointment with the Indiana Pacers for allowing his jersey number 7 to be worn by other players. O'Neal, who has now retired, took to Instagram to voice his disappointment, believing that the Pacers did not show respect for his contributions as a six-time NBA All-Star. The Pacers have retired only four jersey numbers so far, namely George McGinnis, Reggie Miller, Mel Daniels, and Roger Brown. Number 7 has not been retired and theoretically can be worn by any player. However, after O'Neal retired, players Al Jefferson, Malcolm Brogdon, and George Hill have all worn the number 7 jersey. 

O'Neal's peak years were with the Indiana Pacers, where he achieved significant success. From 2001 to 2006, the Pacers made the playoffs every year, reaching the Eastern Conference Finals in 2004. During this period, O'Neal was selected to the NBA All-Star Game six times, named to the All-NBA Team three times, and won the Most Improved Player award in the 2001-02 season. Over his eight seasons with the Pacers, he averaged 18.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 2.4 blocks per game.
