 202324 Key Player Los Angeles Clippers' Russell Westbrook Reclaims Star Status

Since the Los Angeles Clippers signed Kawhi Leonard and traded for Paul George in 2019, the debate on whether they needed to strengthen their point guard position has been a topic of discussion every year. From Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams, Rajon Rondo, Reggie Jackson, to John Wall, most fans did not expect Russell Westbrook to be the final option.

After all, when it comes to playing style, he has never been considered in the discussion for the Clippers, and he is not as suitable as Malcolm Brogdon, who was unsuccessful in the summer trade, or James Harden, who has been rumored.

Continue reading In February of this year, the Clippers unexpectedly became the best team for Russell Westbrook. This is the only place where he can reclaim his star status, and now, the Clippers will be a team that relies on Russell Westbrook.

When Westbrook compromised and became a backup for the Lakers last season, and was subsequently bought out by the Jazz, it was widely believed that "Westbrook will no longer be Westbrook," and his career as a star may have come to an end. There would not be a team willing to let him lead, and most people were not optimistic about whether Westbrook, who has been a one-man team with little playoff experience, could successfully transition. However, the Clippers emerged and provided an environment that allows him to continue his career as a star. Head coach Ty Lue does not want a restrained and polite Westbrook; he just wants Westbrook to continue being Westbrook.

Going back to February of this year, there were disagreements between the Clippers' management, coach, and players regarding the signing of Westbrook.

Coach Lue repeatedly mentioned that he is a believer in traditional point guard play and wants to have a guard on the court to facilitate the team's tactics. General manager Lawrence Frank always talked about the "positionless basketball" philosophy that has been discussed for four years, emphasizing the importance of functional complementarity over traditional point guard play.

This philosophy was reflected in their trades. Before the trade deadline last season, the Clippers gave up underperforming players Wall and Jackson but did not acquire any point guards in return. Instead, they forced Lue to make Terance Mann the point guard. Initially, the Clippers showed no interest when Westbrook started discussing a buyout with the Jazz. It was rumored that it was because star player George spoke up and received support from Kawhi, which made the signing possible.

Continue reading Compared to the Lakers, the Clippers, who are also located in Los Angeles, can be considered Westbrook's comfort zone. He immediately secured a starting position after the trade, has a head coach who relies on guards, good friends and former teammates in George, and can maintain his aggressive playing style. The Clippers significantly increased their pace after Westbrook joined. Their offensive pace, which was ranked 24th in the league with a PACE of 98.24 before the All-Star break, rose to 100.55, ranking 13th in the league. This allows Westbrook to fully utilize his athleticism.

Ironically, Kawhi and George's load management and their early season-ending injuries gave Westbrook a lot of ball handling responsibilities and room to shine. He shattered people's doubts and proved once again that he still has star value. In a regular-season game against the Grizzlies on March 30, when Kawhi and George were absent due to load management, Westbrook had a standout performance with 36 points, 10 assists, and 4 rebounds. In the last three minutes of the first quarter, Westbrook drove to the basket and shouted "And 1" after drawing a foul, a moment that was selected as the fans' favorite highlight of the year, fully showcasing his competitiveness and passion.

In Game 1 of the playoffs against the Suns, despite a poor shooting performance of 3 for 19, Westbrook played a crucial role on defense. He defended against Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Chris Paul 59 times, allowing only 6 points and even blocking Booker in a key moment, securing the Clippers' only playoff victory of the season. With Kawhi sidelined due to injury, Westbrook had impressive performances in Game 3 and Game 4, scoring 30 points with 12 assists and 8 rebounds, and 37 points with 6 assists and 4 rebounds respectively. He became the sixth player in Clippers history to score over 30 points in consecutive playoff games. Throughout the series, he averaged 23.6 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists, displaying his star-level performance. Continue reading Not only does Westbrook have star-worthy statistics, but he is also the spiritual leader following Patrick Beverley. Lue once mentioned, "The players were not emotionally down (when Kawhi got injured in the playoffs). Everything changed because Westbrook was in the locker room. Whether I'm on the court with him or he's playing with Michael Jordan, he plays the same way. He makes everyone in the locker room believe that we can win the game."
