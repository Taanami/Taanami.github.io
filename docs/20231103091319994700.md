  The Unbeatable Tactic of the Denver Nuggets - An Unsolvable Killing Move

In the first quarter of the opening game of the NBA season, the Denver Nuggets never fell behind after taking the lead and eventually defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 119-107.

Despite the Lakers constantly biting at the score, the defending champions did not hand over the important victory of the opening game.

The Nuggets showed the world why they are a championship team by executing their tactics over and over again, showcasing not only their talent but also their firepower against the defense. Keep reading While people often think of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray when talking about the Nuggets, the opening game victory was achieved by three players working together, and the final piece to the puzzle was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. We will take a look at how the Nuggets made their opponents helpless through snippets of their tactical execution from the opening game. The following clip is from when there was a little over five minutes left in the game and the Lakers had narrowed the gap to seven points.

The tactic starts with Jokic setting a screen for KCP, who then moves to the top of the arc.

Murray then passes the ball to Jokic, who sets another screen for KCP.

Taking advantage of the Lakers' communication breakdown, two defenders leave KCP open for a layup, while also giving Murray an open opportunity for a three-pointer.

In the next offensive possession, the Nuggets start with the same initial move. Jokic sets a screen for KCP, who then sets a screen for Murray and uses Jokic as a screen himself. Once again, the Lakers are a step behind, allowing KCP to have an open mid-range jump shot. Keep reading Yes, you read that right. The next offensive possession, which occurred just 30 seconds after the previous one, uses the same starting move.

Jokic sets a screen for KCP, who then sets a screen for Murray, but this time, there is a new twist.

KCP cuts in after setting the screen, slipping between Jokic and Murray. After a hand-off between Murray and Jokic, Murray draws three defenders, leaving an easy pass for Aaron Gordon to make a dunk.

After three consecutive successful offensive possessions using the same tactic, the Nuggets once again use the same pattern.

Jokic sets a screen for KCP, who then sets a traditional high pick-and-roll with Murray. Murray lobs the ball to Jokic, who immediately passes it to Michael Porter Jr., who easily makes a three-pointer. Four different players scored in four consecutive possessions, expanding their lead from seven to 14 points, effectively putting the Lakers in a tough spot and almost killing the game. Having the best player in the world is certainly a big advantage for the Nuggets, but it is worth noting that Jokic did not score at all during these critical possessions. The reason the Nuggets could easily score was that they knew how to read the defense and react accordingly, with each player knowing their role and using their individual offensive abilities to their advantage. After a championship run and a full, healthy training camp, the Nuggets' offense may once again reach a new level.

This tactic may not be the most perfect one, but it perfectly showcases a team with great chemistry and how they can find different variations within the same tactic to create good scoring opportunities for different players.

As the season progresses, it will be exciting to see what different tactics the defending champions will use to take advantage of their innate strengths and become a formidable team in the league.
