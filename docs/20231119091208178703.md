In a friendly match, Yulon Leopards defeated Yulon Leopards. Photo/Basketball Notes Today, two professional teams in Taoyuan, Taoyuan Pauian Leopards and Taiwan Beer Taiwan Beer Yulon Leopards, played a friendly match at Taoyuan County Stadium. In the beginning of the game, Yulon Leopards quickly expanded their lead to double digits thanks to the outstanding defense of Kao Chin-wei. However, Pauian Leopards, led by Tucker and Washburn, narrowed the gap in scores. At the end of the first quarter, Yulon Leopards were leading 24-19.

In the second quarter, Pauian Leopards gradually caught up in score, but Taiwan Beer Yulon Leopards maintained their lead with the performances of Williams and Hamilton, two foreign players.

However, Taiwan Beer Yulon Leopards lodged a protest because the regulations of the two leagues were different. Ding Endi was considered a foreign student in the PLG league, but in the T1 league, he would be considered as a foreign player. If the rules of the T1 league were applied, Pauian Leopards would have four foreign players registered in this game.

After some discussion, the records and the referees determined that Ding Endi's qualifications did not meet the requirements, and he had no chance to play in this game.

At halftime, Yulon Leopards were temporarily leading 37-36. In the second half, Pauian Leopards struggled in both offense and defense, while Taiwan Beer Yulon Leopards extended their lead to double digits with the continuous attacks in the paint by Hamilton and Williams. At the end of the third quarter, Yulon Leopards were leading 68-56. In the final quarter, Pauian Leopards still could not find their rhythm on offense, while Yulon Leopards continued to score in the paint with their two foreign players. Although Lu Jun-xiang's shooting improved in the last few minutes, the game was almost over. In the end, Yulon Leopards defeated Pauian Leopards 97-71, claiming the victory in this friendly match.
