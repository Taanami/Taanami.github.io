On Friday, the United States and Germany played a thrilling game in the quarterfinals. Both teams had a rare high-scoring match in recent FIBA international competitions, with each scoring at least 110 points. In the end, Germany pulled ahead with a crucial three-pointer by Obst, winning the ticket to the finals with a slight 2-point difference.

The German team has several players who have played in the NBA, and the most famous of them is Dennis Schroder, who has played for teams like the Hawks, Thunder, and Lakers. Before the semifinals, Schroder talked about his thoughts on this game, expressing his happiness to meet the United States on the World Cup stage and looking forward to facing his former teammate Austin Reaves. After the game on Friday, Schroder and Reaves embraced tightly, showing their strong bond. Reaves even went to the German team's locker room after changing his clothes to congratulate Schroder once again on reaching the finals. Schroder also posted yesterday, documenting this moment and expressing that tears almost came to his eyes when he saw Reaves.
