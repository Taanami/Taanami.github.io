  PLG Report - Unexpected Return of Walker, Full-Strength Warm-up Battle Between Lions and Dreamers

PLG is back! After a long wait, the highly anticipated PLG opened the new season with a warm-up match in Keelung, the northernmost city of Taiwan. This is also a great opportunity for teams to test out their newly strengthened lineups during the summer break. Let's continue reading for the first match between the Hsinchu Lions and the Formosa Dreamers.

Starting lineup for the Lions: Chu Yun-hao, Kao Kuo-hao, Wang Tzu-kang, Clark, Coach Ou

Starting lineup for the Dreamers: Lu Kuan-liang, Lin Chun-ji, Qian Kenney, Bezaneshvili, McCallum

Observations on Coach Ou

Although Coach Ou did not have many offensive opportunities, his ability to read the court was evident as he directed the newly joined Clark to find open teammates. While he didn't show any particularly impressive moves on offense, it was clear that Coach Ou is a team-oriented player. With the partnership of Brown, he is expected to have a great season, but he will also have to work harder to secure his spot in the team midway through the season. However, based on his performance in this game, he is a player that I personally like and I am looking forward to seeing him play in the new season.

On the defensive end, Coach Ou's solid build allowed him to protect the rim and rebound well against the undersized McCallum and Bezaneshvili. It will be interesting to see if he is suitable for a smaller lineup.

The Return of Walker

After a season of rest, Walker finally returned to the court with his hustle and energy. He fought for offensive rebounds and even if he couldn't make the first shot, he made it difficult for his opponents to defend him. If he can return to full strength this season, his partnership with Qian Kenney will continue to give opponents headaches in the backcourt. Clark's exceptional performance on both ends of the court

As someone who has been following the BIG 3 league for a while, I am quite familiar with Earl Clark. Although I haven't kept up with his NBA career, it's not a coincidence that he was named the Defensive Player of the Year in the BIG 3 for two consecutive years. His long wingspan, excellent defensive reads, and impressive physical abilities make him a valuable contributor on the court. In addition to his increased use of mid-range shots, his success rate on open three-point shots in this game is a big confidence boost for Lions fans.

Coach Lin expressed in the post-game press conference that Clark has only practiced with the team three times, but his great physical condition and discipline allowed him to quickly integrate into the team. We can expect to see his performance in the regular season and see if he can challenge for the title of the best import player. He will also be a key player in leading the Lions to victory.

The Success of the Lions' 5-out Motion Offense and the Struggle of the Single Import Player

In the first quarter, the Lions experimented with a 5-out motion offense, with cuts to the basket and rotations, which worked well. However, it could just be an experiment and we will have to continue to observe.

In the second quarter, when they only had one import player on the court, the Lions struggled on defense as they couldn't contain the Dreamers' imports. This is an area they will need to work on, especially when they have a smaller lineup.

The Return of Bu Yi-de

Bu Yi-de, who played for SBL's Changhua Bank last season, returned to the Dreamers this season. Although he only played for less than 10 minutes in this game, I am looking forward to seeing his performance. After experiencing the single import player system in the SBL, returning to a dual import player system and playing with familiar teammates may give him more opportunities to showcase his skills and make the competition for the four import spots more intense. The Dreamers' 2-3 Zone Defense with Player Marking

The Dreamers used a 2-3 zone defense with player marking when facing the Lions without any import ball handlers. This effectively neutralized their cutting and passing offense and forced them to take difficult three-point shots. With the addition of Qian Kenney, this defense will be even more formidable with the protection of Gilbeck.

The Surprising Performance of the Local Lineup

In the post-game press conference, Coach Lin mentioned that due to some of the imports having physical discomfort, they were limited to 15 minutes of playing time. As a result, the Lions played almost the entire second half with a full local lineup. To everyone's surprise, they played extremely well, with everyone sharing the ball and putting in effort on defense. This shows the team's great chemistry and determination for the new season. Coach Lin repeatedly praised their performance and mentioned that with better offensive execution, they will be a strong contender this season.
