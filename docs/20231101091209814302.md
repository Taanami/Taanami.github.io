The Warriors players have very good skills, but last season we didn't get to the free throw line very often, ranking near the bottom of the league.

If Kuminga can attack in the paint and draw more fouls, the team will become much better."

With two of the top perimeter shooters on the team, the Warriors have relied mostly on three-pointers or difficult passes to score in the past decade. However, with the stars getting older and physical disadvantages, the Warriors need more easy points from the free throw line, in addition to scoring through constant running and physical confrontation. Please continue reading. The Warriors still rely mainly on three-pointers and backdoor scoring, but adding 8 to 10 passes and 2 to 3 dunks per game would definitely make a huge difference.

And Kuminga has the ability to take the Warriors to a new level. It can be said that Kuminga is the most important player for the Warriors this season, as most of the Warriors' players are small in size and age, and most of their scoring still relies on shooting. Kuminga is one of the few young players on the team with a tall and strong physique. Photo source: Getty ImagesIn addition to offense, Kuminga will also have an impact on the team's defense. In the past, he occasionally made serious mistakes on defense or was in the wrong position, but now there is no one else on the team with the same physical qualities as him.

His athleticism and physique will bring great help to the team, something that no one else on the Warriors can do. Please continue reading. If Kuminga can threaten opponents on the perimeter, he will be the main power forward for the Warriors this season.

The Warriors will let Draymond Green guard the paint and create a crazy defensive line in the paint.

CP3 and Dario Saric, who were added in the offseason, will provide help for the Warriors, but the key player for the Warriors this season is Kuminga.

Everyone already knows the skills and impact of Curry, Thompson, Green, Wiggins, and CP3, so the real variable is Kuminga, making him the X-factor for the Warriors this season.

If he evolves, the Warriors will once again be feared by their opponents, as they will have too many ways to score and will no longer rely solely on three-pointers.

Kuminga will not only have a crucial impact on the Warriors this season, but also in the years to come. After Thompson, there is a high chance that he will sign a new contract with the Warriors, and Green still has four years left on his contract. Although the main players are still here, their age is getting older and their overall athleticism has been declining. With the energy and power brought by Kuminga, the team with an average age that is on the older side still has a chance to turn things around and have hope for contending for the championship in the next few years.
