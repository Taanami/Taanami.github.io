 The NBA's new rest policy has officially taken effect, applying to 48 players who are prohibited from taking unjustified rest during regular season games. The policy, proposed by Adam Silver, was approved by the NBA Board of Governors and will be implemented in the 2023-24 season. The five main directions of the NBA rest policy include: teams with multiple star players cannot rest them simultaneously, star players must not have obvious injuries to miss important games (such as midseason invitationals and national broadcasts), and personal awards have a requirement of playing at least 65 games to be eligible for selection.

According to a player list compiled by ESPN reporter Bobby Marks, the players affected by this rule are those who have been selected for the All-Star Game and All-NBA teams in the past three years. It is expected that 48 players will be impacted by this rule. Marks also mentioned that if a player is selected as an All-Star during the season, regardless of whether it is their first selection or after a three-year gap, they will also be subject to this policy.

An example given by Marks is Tyrese Maxey of the Philadelphia 76ers. If he is selected for the All-Star Game for the first time in February next year, he will be included in this list and will be subject to the rest policy for subsequent games.

As for highly popular rookie Victor Wembanyama, Marks stated that he would not be subject to the rest policy as he has no NBA playing record in the past. He would only be included in the list if he is selected for the All-Star Game in his rookie season. Marks also mentioned that there is no requirement of playing at least 65 games for the Rookie of the Year and All-Rookie First Team selections.
