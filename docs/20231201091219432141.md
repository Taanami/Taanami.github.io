The Hangzhou Asian Games basketball event began today with 16 teams participating. The Chinese team was assigned to Group B, along with China, Mongolia, and Hong Kong. The Chinese team struggled a little at the beginning, but quickly found their rhythm and pulled ahead with a double-digit lead. Although they encountered some small disturbances on the offensive end in the second half, they were still able to overcome them smoothly. Liu Zheng scored 10 points in the last quarter to solidify the team's victory. The Chinese men's basketball team had a successful start to the tournament.

In the first few minutes of the game, the Chinese team did not seem to be in their best form. However, the high-low combination of Atino and Zeng Wendin in the paint, as well as Lu Junxiang's three-pointer, helped break the deadlock for the Chinese team. Following that, Liu Zheng and Lin Tingqian also scored consecutively, quickly widening the gap to over ten points. The Chinese team's defense put pressure on Hong Kong's guards in the frontcourt, causing them to make many mistakes. In the second quarter, the Chinese team's scoring was concentrated in the first half. In the second half, their shooting percentage was limited, and the score did not widen.

In the second half, Hong Kong showed more patience in handling each possession, and their guard Xu Yuanzheng (No.24) stood out by scoring multiple times. Meanwhile, the Chinese team relied on the small group combination of Zeng Wendin and Abasi, as well as Li Qiwei's three-pointers and Atino's presence in the paint, to stabilize their offensive firepower.

In the final quarter, Hong Kong's Huilong'er (No.11) performed well, making several three-point shots and causing communication errors in the Chinese team's defense. At the start of the fourth quarter, the Chinese team only scored 8 points and Atino was also ejected after receiving multiple fouls within a short period of time. Hong Kong closed the gap to a 15-point difference.

Fortunately, the Chinese team's main player Liu Zheng took charge in the closing stage, single-handedly scoring 10 points and two three-pointers, completely crushing Hong Kong's comeback attempt. In the end, the Chinese team won their first victory at the Asian Games with a score of 81-62. Liu Zheng finished the game with the highest 18 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists, and 3 steals, while Lin Tingqian had 14 points, 7 assists, and 3 steals. Atino contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds, while Zeng Xiangjun and Abasi each scored 10 points.

For Hong Kong, Huilong'er scored the highest 16 points and 8 rebounds, while Xu Yuanzheng had 14 points and Yip Yiu-bun had 10 points.
