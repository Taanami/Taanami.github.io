Deandre Ayton, one of the key players in the trade involving Damian Lillard, has also joined the Portland Trail Blazers through the trade. As a result, Ayton has naturally become the starting center for Portland, forming a future starting lineup with Anfernee Simons, Scoot Henderson, and Shaedon Sharpe.

Today, Ayton arrived in Portland and the community shared a video of his first day at the training facility. It is evident that Ayton is very happy and he refers to himself as "dominAYTON" (a combination of dominate and Ayton). In the video, he expresses his gratitude for joining Portland and says he is ready and excited for the upcoming season. He feels like he has been drafted again, and he will also be changing his jersey number to 2. Additionally, it is worth noting that there is no mention of Jrue Holiday in this video and social media posts from the Trail Blazers, indicating a high probability of him being traded by the team once again.
