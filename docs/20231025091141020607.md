 Introducing the Teams of the Chao Yao Cup: Ohka Gakuen High School from Japan

In the 2021 FIBA Asia Cup Women's Basketball Tournament, Japan defeated China to win their fifth consecutive championship. They also made history by winning a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics. This is a testament to the success of Japan's "Sports Promotion Plan," which was implemented in 2013 and has brought about significant and even astonishing results in both professional and student development. It has become a model worth emulating.

This year, the Chao Yao Cup International Team invited Ohka Gakuen High School, a renowned breeding ground for Japan's new generation of women's basketball players. The school has been a dominant force in Japan's high school women's basketball scene and has produced numerous top players. Their innovative and dynamic style of play has shattered the stereotype of Asian basketball players being at a physical disadvantage. They have won a total of 71 national titles, including the most wins in the Japan Winter Cup (24), the highest single-game score in the women's division (139 points), the most wins in the Inter-High basketball tournament (25), and 22 titles and five consecutive championships in the National Sports Festival. They also achieved a legendary score of "268:0" against their opponent, Toyohashi High School, in the 2014 Aichi Prefecture qualifier for the Inter-High tournament.

Ohka Gakuen High School, the undisputed "factory" for producing Japan's national team players, has not only established a dynasty in high school women's basketball in Japan, but also cultivated many top players in the international basketball scene. These include WNBA's former Seattle Storm center Ramu Tokashiki, 2020 Olympic silver medalists Maki Takada and Nanaho Miyoshi, Japanese-Ghanaian "Mango sisters" Evelyn and Stephanie Mawuli, and WNBA's former Phoenix Mercury player and newly announced inductee into the FIBA Hall of Fame for 2021, Yuko Oshima. Maki Takada, a key player in Japan's silver medal-winning team at the Tokyo Olympics, is a graduate of Ohka Gakuen High School.

The team has a wealth of international experience and has been actively participating in international exchanges prior to the pandemic. In 2017, they won the Grandmas' Cup in Taiwan with five consecutive victories, and in 2018, they formed a strong bond with Taipei Yangming High School in the Yangming Cup International Women's Basketball Invitational Tournament. This year, they will once again come to Taiwan to participate in the Chao Yao Cup, with a lineup that includes co-captains Kokoro Kurokawa and Kokoro Tanaka, and "Asian prodigy" center Rina Fukuo. In addition, four new freshmen, Nana Nagahamada, Mina Abe, Anri Kanazawa, and Sakura Yamada, were also key players in Japan's U16 Asia Youth team that defeated Taiwan's women's basketball team by 47 points.

What kind of "education" will this team, with such a wealth of international experience, bring to the Taiwanese women's basketball players? It is something to look forward to.

The Ohka Gakuen High School team, which has confirmed its participation in the Chao Yao Cup this year, has already expressed to the organizers that they are excited to once again participate in international exchanges and competitions after the pandemic. They are looking forward to seeing and absorbing the strengths of other countries and incorporating them into their own "new Japanese style" of basketball, which will make them even more competitive on the world stage.

As the current top team in Japan, will they be able to rise even higher and become a more influential breeding ground for student players on the international basketball stage? This is a goal and milestone that is certainly within their reach.
