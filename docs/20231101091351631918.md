The Damian Lillard trade saga was completed early this morning, causing a stir among the entire league. Today, reporter Chris Haynes wrote a lengthy article about the developments of this situation over the past few months.

Haynes chronologically details the events of this saga. It started with Lillard expressing his desire to be traded, and the only communication between the Miami Heat and Portland Trail Blazers was during the summer league in early July. However, the Heat wanted to have an in-person meeting to discuss the trade, but it never happened. At this point, the Blazers released a statement saying they would seek the best offer and were not limited to Miami. Lillard's camp then stated that he would only be satisfied if he was traded to the Heat, and the league intervened to mediate the situation. However, there were no updates about this matter after the summer league ended. Lillard's agent, Aaron Goodwin, took action and suggested that Lillard speak with general manager Joe Cronin. Both parties agreed to meet, and during the meeting, Lillard expressed his disappointment with how the situation was being handled. Cronin promised to strive for the most attractive package, but Lillard knew at that moment that he would most likely not be going to the Heat.

Haynes even wrote in the article that Lillard told Cronin during the meeting, "If I can't go to the Heat, then I would rather withdraw the trade and stay with the Blazers." Cronin's response was that Lillard could not return to the team.

Lillard was surprised to hear this and felt frustrated that he couldn't go back to Portland. He still believed that he might not leave the team, so he continued to train at the Blazers' training center. He told reporters, "I'm still on the team roster, and I usually train here at this time. I'm not trying to cause any problems. This is not like me. Everyone is happy to see me, except for Cronin. He never talks to me, and when I noticed it, I made up my mind that I wouldn't go to him."

Lillard's camp felt the need to address this issue urgently, so his agent also approached the Bucks and Nets.

The reporter also reported that Bucks GM Jon Horst regularly asked the Blazers if Lillard could be traded, but the answer was always that both GMs wanted their star players to stay on their respective teams. The tension between Lillard's camp and the Blazers' organization continued to escalate, and the league had to hold another coordination meeting to address the issue. The main focus of the meeting was the communication breakdown between the Blazers and Lillard's camp. Cronin promised to improve the communication in the future. In fact, the reporter also mentioned in the article that Cronin intentionally distanced himself from Lillard's camp because he did not want to ruin any potential trades. Finally, the trade was completed before the start of training camp, with the Blazers receiving Deandre Ayton, Jrue Holiday, a first-round pick, and two first-round pick swaps. Holiday could even be traded again to other teams.
