  Check out Chinese Men's Basketball: Zeng Wen-Ding returns, the status of Zeng Xiang-Jun and Li De-Wei may be difficult to find

This time, the Chinese Men's Basketball team has added many talented local players to their roster. However, based on the performance in the Jones Cup, it seems that they have not found a suitable candidate to replace the starting lineup. With the confirmation that Chen Ying-Jun cannot participate in the Asian Games, Zeng Wen-Ding has been included in the roster. The question is whether Li De-Wei, who has shown good organizational skills, and Zeng Xiang-Jun, who is more agile in offense and defense, will lose the opportunity to take over the inside position. Let's analyze the statement further. Please continue reading.

From the evolution of the tactics in the Jones Cup, we can see that Li De-Wei and Zeng Xiang-Jun have overlapping roles. In addition to naturalized player Ater Majok being the pillar in the inside position, there are also six local players available, including Li De-Wei, Zeng Xiang-Jun, and Chen Guan-Quan as the main substitutes, and Zhou Bo-Xun, Zeng Wen-Ding, and Wang Hao-Ji as backup options. This strengthens the team's defense in the paint. However, the average rebound per game for the local players is only 7.9, with a total of 38 rebounds per game, excluding Ater Majok's contribution of 10.5 rebounds. This means that the team has not solidified the paint area as well as expected. Moreover, with a shortage of guards, the organization of the offense has become a major challenge, which in turn affects the selection of inside players. This will be a dilemma that the team will face in the Asian Games.

Li De-Wei has been a regular starter in the previous games, providing ball-handling skills in the inside position to alleviate the pressure on Lin Ting-Qian, who is playing as a substitute point guard. He often plays in the high post or top of the key, using hand-offs and screens to create opportunities. The "Chicago Action" tactic highlights his unique characteristics among these inside players.

As shown in the table above, Li De-Wei has performed well in terms of assists and rebounding against the Philippines and Japan. Although he lacks agility, he has the height and physicality to defend well in the paint. He contributes an average of 1.4 blocks per game, which is impressive.

However, his scoring has been limited, with a maximum of only 5 points in a single game. As the team's tactics gradually changed, he was put on the bench for rotation. The key moment was the game against Qatar, where the pick-and-roll combination of Lin Ting-Qian and Ater Majok opened up a new path, shifting the focus from high post ball-handling and attempting to involve the power forward in the attack to provide more options.

Although Li De-Wei can shoot from the outside, his shot speed is not fast. He is capable of back-to-the-basket post-ups, but lacks the skills and agility to outplay his opponents. His efficiency in following up on offensive rebounds is not good, and his offensive contributions mainly come from receiving small passes and second-chance points. The recent deviation in his plus-minus value proves that his effectiveness on the court is decreasing, and his role is becoming somewhat unclear.

Now, let's talk about an episode from the Jones Cup. Zeng Xiang-Jun expressed his dissatisfaction with his playing time on social media. Although he had fewer opportunities to play in the early games, his statistics were not bad, and he efficiently completed his tasks. His performance was comparable to the average, proving his stability.

As mentioned before, with Lin Ting-Qian leading the offense, there is a greater demand for the power forward position to contribute on offense. Zeng Xiang-Jun, who is quick in shooting from the outside, agile in movement, and has enough impact, has become the preferred option in the lineup. He made 2 three-pointers against the UAE and the United States, and scored in double digits in the last four games, with a plus-minus value of 33 against South Korea. He creates more space for the team's half-court offense and increases the fast-break capabilities, providing more offensive options for the Chinese team.

Agility is Zeng Xiang-Jun's advantage as an inside player. With a height of 205 cm and a weight of 95 kg, he has a well-proportioned body that allows him to play as a stretch five or in a small-ball lineup. He has good awareness in following up on plays and has offensive skills in the mid-range, making him more suitable for the modern basketball trend in both offense and defense. Unless there are significant changes in the coaching staff, Zeng Xiang-Jun will always be the preferred choice in the lineup. However, his average of 0.9 assists and 0.7 blocks per game shows that he is mainly a scorer, and his court vision and passing skills need improvement. He has limited effectiveness in connecting with the center position, which is why his playing time is restricted. Additionally, he still needs to develop his awareness in setting screens to provide more options for the coach. 

To sum up, Zeng Xiang-Jun and Li De-Wei are two completely different types of players in the local inside positions for the Chinese Men's Basketball team. One focuses on defense and playmaking, while the other excels in offense and speed. Both players bring different offensive and defensive styles to the team. In the Jones Cup, the playing time of these two players alternated, not because of their performance, but because of the tactical emphasis on ball handling. However, it can be confirmed that they will be the main forces in the Asian Games, alongside the naturalized foreign players.

Under normal circumstances, with the presence of the three CBA stars and quality local point guards, it would be clear who would start and come off the bench. However, injuries have caused changes in the lineup, making it both open and unpredictable. After Chen Ying-Jun's withdrawal from the Asian Games, Wu Yong-Sheng was brought in as a substitute, but the lack of a point guard is evident. Lin Ting-Qian still needs to play as the main point guard, and Zeng Wen-Ding's inclusion in the roster leaves no doubt about the choice of local inside players. It is certain that, except for Zeng Xiang-Jun, the other inside players will have limited playing opportunities. Despite being 39 years old, Zeng Wen-Ding's efficient playing style, basketball IQ, and ball-handling skills are necessary to win games. Unless other position players have a good shooting touch, he will likely play around 20 minutes. The constant changes in the roster have brought disappointment, as the pursuit of medals is important, but sacrificing the future is not an option.
