# The essay 'Peak Essays' overestimates and underestimates both the USA team and Austin Reaves of the Lakers 
 
The essay 'Peak Essays' overestimates and underestimates both the USA team and Austin Reaves of the Lakers. Both teams are versatile Swiss Army knives.

The essay discusses interesting topics and players, occasionally commenting on current events. In late March 2023, when the Lakers were still seeking a playoff spot, I wrote an essay called 'Peak Essays' about the rise and outstanding performance of Austin Reaves, the white shooting guard nicknamed AR15.

Being in the spotlight in Los Angeles, playing for the prestigious Lakers, Reaves has been the subject of news and various comments. In an anonymous poll among NBA players at the end of the season, Reaves was chosen as one of the most overrated and underrated players. Starting from being undrafted in the draft, his career was underestimated (although later it was proven to be intentional by Reaves' camp), but in his second season, he became a key player for the Lakers (perhaps due to his skin color), which led to a mystery surrounding his true value and abilities.

Former NBA player Rashad McCants stated on a podcast that Reaves has been overhyped simply because he is a white player playing for the Lakers, taking advantage of the Lakers' injury-riddled situation.

Who is McCants? He was a prominent college player, a scoring shooting guard with explosive athleticism. He came from the prestigious North Carolina University, where he won a championship in the NCAA. He was selected 14th overall by the Timberwolves in 2005. However, limited by his playing style and physique, McCants is a glaring example of a college scorer who failed to transition successfully. After his four-year rookie contract expired, he couldn't secure a second contract and couldn't make a name for himself in Europe either. His professional career has nothing noteworthy.

It's fair to say that McCants is bitter because he couldn't achieve what Reaves has achieved. However, having opportunities is one thing, but making the most of them is another. Just look at the Linsanity phenomenon. Please continue reading to find out whether Reaves is overrated or underrated. Based on his performance in the latter part of the regular season and throughout the playoffs, I personally believe that Reaves is the real deal, at least a qualified starter. At just 25 years old, he still has room for improvement. If we say that his value in the regular season is limited, then his performance in the playoffs is enough, right? Although his performance in the play-in tournament was mediocre, he significantly improved in the playoffs.

In his first career playoffs, Reaves started in all 16 games, played over 36 minutes per game, averaged 17 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 4.6 assists, with only 1.6 turnovers per game. Although his performance dropped in the second round, he bounced back strongly in the Western Conference Finals, averaging over 20 points per game with an impressive shooting percentage. He became the third option for the Lakers after LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

After the season, Reaves was selected to represent the national team in the Basketball World Cup, continuing to impress. Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, the Lakers' second-round opponent, said, 'Based on Reaves' performance in the Western Conference playoffs, it was an easy decision to choose him.' International games value physique, shooting, and decision-making on the court. They want primary ball handlers who can also shoot, cut, pass, and defend multiple positions without being exploited.

Reaves possesses all these abilities, and his understanding and impact on the game are very high, making his selection for the national team no coincidence.

Former Lakers teammate and current Philadelphia 76ers guard Patrick Beverley praised Reaves on his personal podcast. He said that Reaves' intelligence is what makes him impressive. Due to his appearance, Reaves has been underestimated.

Based on my experience playing with him, Reaves has a great understanding of the game, which allows him to frequently get to the free-throw line.

In the NBA, there are two types of players who can get to the free-throw line in large numbers. One type is those with incredible athleticism and physique who can dunk over opponents, and the other type is those who are very smart.

It's obvious that Reaves belongs to the second type. Reaves' abilities are well-known among basketball circles, but due to his restricted free agency status, he didn't attract much attention in the market. With only two years of experience, he had no salary cap space available with the Lakers and could only accept the early bird exception contract, signing a 4-year, $56 million deal with a player option for the fourth year and a 15% trade kicker. It is clearly below market value considering Reaves' skills. In comparison, Jordan Poole, who has a slightly stronger offensive firepower but weaker organization and defense, signed a 4-year, $128 million contract. Tyler Herro of the Miami Heat signed a 4-year, $120 million contract, offering even higher cost-effectiveness. In recent years, NBA salaries have rapidly increased, and a young quality starter's annual salary of $20 million is considered the baseline. Reaves' salary is lower than his output.

Whether with his mother team, the Lakers, or in the upcoming World Cup, Reaves plays a similar role.

Offensively, he mainly acts as a playmaker, occasionally initiating pick-and-rolls and defusing time bombs. He can switch between on-ball and off-ball roles, has low turnover tendencies, threatens from the perimeter, and defensively, Reaves is a coach's valuable chess piece. In warm-up games, it was not uncommon to see three guards on the court at the same time. When he first started, Reaves earned playing time through his defense. In his rookie year, he fearlessly guarded top-tier guards like Ja Morant and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, earning praise from fellow Lakers alum and defensive stalwart Alex Caruso. In the recent playoff journey, Reaves didn't neglect his defense, especially when he chased the Warriors' splash brothers. In the later stages of the series, it even affected his own shooting.

In summary, Austin Reaves is a versatile player who is both underrated and overestimated. He has proven himself in the playoffs and international games, showcasing his abilities and basketball IQ. Despite his restricted free agency status, he has shown his value on the court. Whether for the Lakers or in the upcoming World Cup, Reaves will play a crucial role as a playmaker and a smart defender."
