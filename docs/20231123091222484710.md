  PLG New Taipei Kings Welcome Asian Import Hayden to Boost Strength for Upcoming EASL Season

The New Taipei Kings have announced the signing of Asian import player Hayden Blankley for the upcoming East Asia Super League (EASL) season on September 22. The 23-year-old Australian, who recently played for the Bay Area Dragons and joined the professional scene in 2022, will join the Kings and compete in the EASL to showcase his skills and help the team challenge in the PBA League.

Standing at 198cm, Hayden was born in New South Wales, Australia and attended NCAA Division II West Texas A&M University. In 2022, he joined the Bay Area Dragons in Hong Kong and competed in the PBA League, averaging 13.4 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game with a 40.3% three-point shooting percentage. He also had a career-high of 47 points in a game with 10 three-pointers made, helping the Bay Area Dragons to a runner-up finish in the league. In the previous EASL season, he played 3 games and contributed 9.7 points, 4 rebounds, and a 53% three-point shooting percentage. Known for his excellent physical condition, Hayden recently joined the Bankstown Bears in Australia's NBL1 league, averaging 21.9 points and 10.8 rebounds per game. His sharpshooting and agile off-ball movement will be valuable assets for the Kings in the professional league.

After joining the New Taipei Kings, Hayden will compete with the team in 6 EASL group stage games with the goal of helping the team advance to the top 4 and achieve better results. General Manager Mao Jiaen said, "When Hayden challenged the PBA last year, we noticed that his playing style is very suitable for the Kings' defense. His height and playing style can cover the 2, 3, and even 4 positions, and he is a selfless team player who does not dominate the ball. He will be a great help in creating space for our experienced backcourt players. With the combination of Hayden and the rest of the team, we believe the Kings will have a strong weapon to challenge in the EASL."
