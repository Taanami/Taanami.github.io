  請繼續往下閱讀No. 7: Stephen Curry金州勇士｜得分後衛運動畫刊排名：72021 ESPN 排名：62021 運動畫刊排名：4Curry 在 2014-15 年球季打出了聯盟最偉大的例行賽表現，然後打出了史上最偉大的球季。

 但他的偉大，並不代表他不會衰老。事實上，他在 2019-20 年球季就已經飛躍很多，然後在 2020-21 年又更上層樓。

 在 2015-16 年，他的三分球命中率是 45.4%，也就是歷史第 1 名。然後在 2019-20 年，他的三分球命中率是 42.6%，是歷史第 2 名。然後在 2020-21 年，他的三分球命中率是 42.1%，是歷史第 3 名。

 這是一個不可能的成就。他的三分球命中率在進步嗎？還是在倒退？No. 6: James Harden布魯克林籃網｜得分後衛運動畫刊排名：52021 ESPN 排名：42021 運動畫刊排名：5Harden 在 2020-21 年球季是聯盟最有爭議的球員，因為他的那套「強迫對方犯規」的技巧，讓不少球迷反感他的表現。

 然而 Harden 的得分與助攻數據仍舊非常驚人，場均可以拿到 24 分和 10 助攻，更是能夠讓籃網打出 11 勝 2 敗的戰績。

 在上季的最後 20 場例行賽，他在左大腿的傷勢讓他無法以最佳狀態出場，因此季後賽的表現並不出色，但他仍然是 NBA 中最全能的後衛之一，即使他的球風如此引人注目，但他的三分球命中率仍然可以高達 36%，並拿下 34 分，並且讓他得到第 4 名。

 請繼續往下閱讀No. 5: Luka Doncic達拉斯小牛｜得分後衛運動畫刊排名：32021 ESPN 排名：32021 運動畫刊排名：3Doncic 是 NBA 中最年輕的超級巨星，他也是 NBA 中最具有天分的球員之一。他是一個 6 呎 7 吋的控球後衛，他有超過 250 磅的重量，並且他的身手敏捷，讓他在進攻端可以獨當一面。

 他在 2020-21 年度贏得了第二座全明星賽的門票，並且拿下了 28.5 分、8.3 助攻和 8.0 籃板的數據，對於一位 22 歲的球員來說，實在是太驚人了。

 Doncic 也在季後賽中打出了很不錯的表現，場均可以拿下 35 分、10.0 助攻和 7.0 籃板，但在第七戰卻因為 46 分的高效率大爆發，讓快艇隊悲傷地結束了這場比賽。如此驚人的表現，讓 Doncic 在未來的幾年內，都將是 NBA 中最具有價值的球員之一。No. 4: Kawhi Leonard洛杉磯快艇｜小前鋒運動畫刊排名：12021 ESPN 排名：72021 運動畫刊排名：6Leonard 是 NBA 中最優秀的防守球員之一，他的控球技巧也相當出色。雖然他在過去的幾年中，因為傷勢的關係，讓他無法維持最佳狀態，但他仍然是 NBA 中最具影響力的球員之一。

 他在 2020-21 年季後賽中的表現也相當不錯，可以拿下 25.1 分、5.2 助攻和 7.7 籃板的數據，並且在東區決賽中，更是在第六戰，帶領快艇隊以 4-2 的戰績擊敗了人氣最高的籃網隊，晉級總冠軍賽。

 Leonard 在過去幾年中，已經證明自己是 NBA 中最出色的球員之一，但他仍然需要保持健康，讓自己能夠維持最佳狀態，才能夠在新賽季帶領快艇隊再次挑戰冠軍。No. 3: Joel Embiid費城76人｜中鋒運動畫刊排名：52021 ESPN 排名：52021 運動畫刊排名：7Embiid 在過去幾年中，一直都是 NBA 中最有價值的球員之一，但他的健康狀況一直都是令人擔憂的問題。在 2020-21 年球季中，他維持了健康的狀態，並且打出了相當驚人的表現，場均可以拿下 28.5 分、10.6 籃板和 2.8 阻攻的數據，更是帶領費城 76 人打出了 49 勝 23 敗的戰績，排名東區第一。

 他在季後賽中的表現也相當不錯，可以拿下 28.1 分、10.5 籃板和 3.4 助攻的數據，但在第七戰卻因為傷勢無法出戰，讓費城 76 人無法和小牛隊進行決戰。如果 Embiid 能夠保持健康，他將會是 NBA 中最有價值的球員之一。No. 2: Nikola Jokic丹佛金塊｜中鋒運動畫刊排名：32021 ESPN 排名：32021 運動畫刊排名：2Jokic 在過去幾年中，一直都是 NBA 中最具有影響力的球員之一，他的控球技巧非常出色，場上的組織能力也是聯盟中最強的。他在 2020-21 年球季中，更是打出了聯盟最佳的表現，場均可以拿下 26.4 分、10.8 籃板和 8.3 助攻的數據，不僅拿下了常規賽 MVP，也帶領金塊隊打出了 47 勝 25 敗的戰績，排名西區第三。

 他在季後賽中的表現也相當不錯，可以拿下 26.0 分、10.8 籃板和 5.8 助攻的數據，但在西區決賽中，金塊隊仍然無法擊敗太陽隊，只能以 4-2 的戰績被淘汰出局。如果 Jokic 能夠保持健康，他將會是 NBA 中最具有影響力的球員之一。No. 1: Giannis Antetokounmpo密爾瓦基公鹿｜大前鋒運動畫刊排名：12021 ESPN 排名：12021 運動畫刊排名：1Antetokounmpo 是 NBA 中最全能的球員之一，他的控球技巧、得分能力和防守能力都相當出色。在 2020-21 年球季中，他更是打出了史上最強大的表現，場均可以拿下 28.1 分、11.0 籃板和 5.9 助攻的數據，不僅拿下了常規賽 MVP，也帶領公鹿隊打出了 46 勝 26 敗的戰績，排名東區第三。

 他在季後賽中的表現也相當出色，可以拿下 30.4 分、12.7 籃板和 5.2 助攻的數據，更在總冠軍賽中打出了 50 分的高效率大爆發，幫助公鹿隊以 4-2 的戰績擊敗太陽隊，拿下了生涯第一座總冠軍。如果 Antetokounmpo 能夠繼續保持這樣的表現，他將會是 NBA 中最具有影響力的球員之一。

No. 10: Devin Booker
Phoenix Suns | Shooting Guard
SI Ranking: 12
ESPN Ranking: 15
SI Ranking: 16

Please continue reading
The highly anticipated 25-year-old Booker has been selected to the All-Star team three times and made it to the All-NBA Team. With his beautiful offensive style, Booker will continue to be one of the top shooting guards in the league in the coming years.

Booker has shone in recent years - from making it to the NBA Finals, winning the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics, leading the Suns to a league-best 64 wins in the regular season, to ultimately losing in an unexpected outcome. The Suns were surprisingly defeated by the Mavericks in the second round of the Western Conference, and in the crucial Game 6 and Game 7, Booker failed to step up and only made 9 out of 31 shots.

However, this cannot erase his high standard of 26.8 points per game (12th in the league). Booker can be considered one of the most lethal scoring aces in the league. However, he must be able to show these scoring skills in critical moments: last season, his overall shooting percentage was as high as 48.5% in the first 9 minutes of a quarter, and his three-point shooting percentage was even higher at 42.1%. However, in the last three minutes, these two numbers dropped to 41.8% and 31.8%, respectively.

No. 9: Ja Morant
Memphis Grizzlies | Point Guard
SI Ranking: 14
ESPN Ranking: 31
SI Ranking: 25

Morant may be the most entertaining player in the NBA today. His amazing jumping ability, along with his almost arrogant confidence and courage, has turned the once low-key Grizzlies into a visual feast for all fans. In just one year, Morant has transformed from a cornerstone player of the Grizzlies into a super superstar in the league. His average of 27.1 points per game is a huge jump of 8 points, and he has also won the Most Improved Player award at the end of the season.

At only 6 feet 3 inches tall, Ja is a true inside scoring master. His style of play is a combination of explosiveness, skill, and fearlessness. Last season, 16.6 points per game came from the paint, making him the first guard to lead this statistic in nearly 25 years.

What will he evolve into in the new season?

No. 8: Kevin Durant
Brooklyn Nets | Small Forward
SI Ranking: 4
ESPN Ranking: 1
SI Ranking: 1

Durant has been making headlines during the off-season. He first requested to be traded, then changed his mind after no takers, and finally had to return to the Nets.

After this drama, how will he readjust to the torn Nets culture and his relationship with the management and head coach? His conflict with the Nets will be one of the most interesting questions in the new season.

When Durant is on the court, he is one of the most powerful players on Earth. The question is, will he age? In fact, he has already taken a leap forward in 2019-20, and then took another step in 2020-21.

In 2015-16, his three-point shooting percentage was 45.4%, ranking first in history. Then in 2019-20, his three-point shooting percentage was 42.6%, ranking second in history. In 2020-21, his three-point shooting percentage was 42.1%, ranking third in history.

This is an impossible achievement. Is his three-point shooting improving or regressing?

No. 7: Stephen Curry
Golden State Warriors | Shooting Guard
SI Ranking: 7
ESPN Ranking: 6
SI Ranking: 4

Curry had the greatest regular season performance in the league in 2014-15, and then had the greatest season ever.

But his greatness does not mean he won't age. In fact, he has already taken a few leaps forward in 2019-20, and then took another step in 2020-21.

In 2015-16, his three-point shooting percentage was 45.4%, ranking first in history. Then in 2019-20, his three-point shooting percentage was 42.6%, ranking second in history. Then in 2020-21, his three-point shooting percentage was 42.1%, ranking third in history.

This is an impossible achievement. Is his three-point shooting improving or regressing?

No. 6: James Harden
Brooklyn Nets | Shooting Guard
SI Ranking: 5
ESPN Ranking: 4
SI Ranking: 5
