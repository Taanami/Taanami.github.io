 China's men's basketball team for the Asian Games in Hangzhou at the end of September has been announced. The roster includes nine players who participated in the recent World Cup, but Zhou Qi, who was diagnosed with a herniated disc, did not make the list. The 12 players selected for the Asian Games are Zhao Rui, Zhao Jiwei, Cheng Shuaipeng, Hu Mingxuan, Zhang Zhenlin, Cui Yongxi, Zeng Fanbo, Zhu Junlong, Fu Hao, Hu Jinqiu, Yu Jiahao, and Wang Zhelin. Three players who were part of the World Cup team, Cheng Shuaipeng, Zeng Fanbo, and Yu Jiahao, have been included in the Asian Games roster. Li Kai'er, a naturalized player, will not participate in the Asian Games due to conflicting schedules with NBA training camp for the upcoming season. As for Zhou Qi, he sustained an injury during the fifth game against the Philippines at the World Cup and has since returned to China for further examination. The results revealed that he has a herniated disc at the L5 S1 level, commonly known as sciatica, causing pain and numbness in his left leg or lower extremities. Zhou Qi will consult multiple doctors to determine the severity of the injury. If it is serious, his recovery is expected to take more than a month, resulting in his absence from the Asian Games. The Asian Games will take place from September 23 to October 8 in Hangzhou, with China facing Lebanon, Taiwan, and Mongolia in the group stage. Their first match will be against Mongolia on September 26.
