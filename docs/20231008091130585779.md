 Active university basketball player Ai-Zhe You continues to evolve in the new season, with unlimited potential for the future.

In recent years, Taiwanese basketball has become popular again, and as the golden generation passes the torch, the growth of the new generation of players has become a focus of attention for fans. One of the rising stars in Taiwanese basketball is Ai-Zhe You, who dominated the small giant egg from high school to university. Basketball has been a part of You's life since he was in high school. 

During that time, he would go to the tribal basketball court with his family, where he not only enjoyed the fun of running, but also the satisfaction of making shots. "Now I feel that basketball has brought me a lot of rewards. The feeling on the court is that if I do something well, I can achieve a sense of accomplishment from it," You said. "The game is constantly changing, and for every play, I imagine the outcome. If I can deliver the ball to where I want it to go, I feel happy and excited. I think this feeling is really great."

In junior high school, You joined a basketball team similar to a "basketball club," where he viewed playing basketball as entertainment and didn't feel much pressure. It was only later, through the introduction of relatives, that he came to Nan-King High Commercial School to challenge the top division. "I felt very comfortable in the environment of Nan-King and with the help of the seniors at the time. I also learned that Nan-King was a school that was good at developing guards, so I wanted to challenge myself by playing basketball here," You said. In his sophomore year, he suffered a severe fracture in his foot. "I felt very down when I got injured. It was the first time I encountered such an injury. I took some time off and discussed it with my family because I didn't perform well in my freshman year and then got injured in my sophomore year. I had some thoughts of giving up."

But my family kept giving me strength to keep going, and the coaching staff at Nan-King didn't give up on me. Coach Cheng-Ming Lin always put me in a position of trust, and I didn't want to disappoint their expectations. I wanted to prove that even though I didn't perform well in my freshman and sophomore years, I still had the ability to lead the team in my senior year.

It wasn't until my senior year that my efforts paid off. "That year was extraordinary for me. It was a turning point in my life, and it was because of that year that I gained some recognition and many people got to know me. I dedicated everything I learned to the basketball court and let everyone see me. I had a lot of confidence in myself that year and knew that I had the ability to perform well. But I also understood that it was the coaching staff's cultivation that allowed me to have such performance."

During his university years, You chose to major in Communication Studies at National Chengchi University. "Senior Yan-Ting also studied at the School of Communication after entering Chengchi University. He shared some of his experiences here with me, and I wanted to emulate him. I found it easier to adapt after I came here. Besides studying in class, I also learned a lot in terms of interpersonal relationships. Under the literary atmosphere of Chengchi University, I gained a lot." 

Many players encounter the issue of "self-management" when they transition from high school to university. When asked about the biggest difference between university and high school, You said, "We don't have a physical education class schedule. In high school, the coach would take care of everything and plan it out for us. But in university, we have a lot of time that we can manage on our own, so we really need to improve our time management."

You's self-discipline helped him transition to the intensity of the University Basketball Association (UBA). In his freshman year, he won Rookie of the Year, Assists King, and Steals King, and also won the UBA championship. "That year was the most exhausting year for me in these three years. I don't know if I was adapting to the intensity of UBA at the time, but Coach Zi-Wei always gave me opportunities and believed in me. He allowed me to take on this responsibility as a freshman and gave me good tactical arrangements. I was really happy that year. I won the championship with my seniors, and it made me realize that winning a championship is not easy."

In his sophomore and junior years, You continued to dominate as the Assists King and Steals King, and also achieved a three-peat. When asked about the difference between these championships, You revealed, "I feel that these two years were a process. I gradually had to transition from being a younger player to a leader. In my freshman and sophomore years, I just followed the seniors step by step, but in my junior year, when faced with critical moments, I realized that I needed to step up and take responsibility. The two championships in my sophomore and junior years felt similar. They were both milestones."

However, as a player at National Chengchi University, You had to balance academics and basketball. After training, he had to rush to class and also take care of his appearance. You relied on the Men's Grooming Amino Acid Facial Cleanser from Man Grooming Hall to combat the oiliness on his face after training. When asked about how he maintains a fresh appearance after training, You revealed his secret weapon: "Normally, I feel that my face is not clean enough after just using regular facial cleanser, but often after washing my face, it feels dry and tight, and then I quickly become oily."

"But after using the Men's Grooming Amino Acid Facial Cleanser, I don't feel dry overall. It feels clean and neat, and not slippery after washing. The oiliness also improves." You added, "After training, when I have to go to class or team gatherings, as long as I wash my face, I look clean and not oily."

Unsatisfied with the current situation, You looks to the future. Although he has already shown comprehensive performance, You believes that he still needs to improve his shooting. "I haven't shown everyone in the game that 'I have this ability,' but I think I just need to keep practicing, both in training and in games. Of course, I hope to become stronger in this aspect and have the weapons to challenge after turning professional."

This summer, You has gained recognition through National Chengchi University's performances, including gaining fame in the World University Games across the Taiwan Strait, defeating NCAA Division I teams to win the WUBS championship, and winning the cross-league invitation tournament against professional teams. You credits the team's chemistry for these achievements, especially the amazing behind-the-back pass during the World University Games that went viral online.

Talking about the behind-the-back pass during the World University Games, You modestly said, "At that time, there wasn't much time left, and I realized that I didn't have a chance to attack. After receiving the pass and turning back, I found Cheng-Hsun cutting to the basket, and I thought that even if I made a mistake at that time, it wouldn't matter (laughs). At that time, Chen-Kang (Tsai Chen-Kang) was actually running to the three-point line, but I wasn't looking at him at all. I turned and saw Cheng-Hsun open, and in the end, he received the pass and made a beautiful layup. It was the result of good teamwork."

During his basketball career, two basketball stars have had a deep impact on You. When asked about his favorite NBA player, You said, "If I have to say, it would be LeBron James! He was my favorite player when I was young, and he was the first player I watched in the NBA. I was especially impressed by his leadership abilities. Although he is older now, I think he has maintained his leadership style, and I really admire his interpretation of the game and his high basketball IQ."

As for his idol in Taiwanese basketball, You revealed, "In Taiwan, it would be Chen Ying-Chun. We both play the same position, and I want to learn from him in terms of his performance on both ends of the court and his ball-handling abilities. His dominance on the court is something that is difficult for me to learn, but I want to strive towards that direction."

You's outstanding performance has also caught the attention of professional basketball players. In a previous interview with Lin Wei-Han, Lin mentioned that among the new generation of players, he has high expectations for You. In response, You humbly said, "I have been watching Lin Wei-Han play basketball, and he is a role model for me to learn from. It is really comfortable to watch him play. He controls the pace of the game very well. I am very grateful for his affirmation, and I will work harder to catch up with the footsteps of my seniors!"

Finally, You shared his plans for the future. After graduation, he plans to participate in the draft, but he doesn't limit himself to specific professional leagues such as the CBA, Taiwanese basketball, or the Japanese BLG. He hopes to find a team that suits his development, whether it's in Taiwan or elsewhere. He will continue to work hard and pursue his basketball dreams, thanking the fans for their support.
