 NBA Beast Mistaken for KD Beast, IG Response: Actually, I'm RickJames

NBA players are often recognized by fans off the court, and the ones who are frequently teased the most are Rajon Rondo, Chris Paul, John Wall, and Kemba Walker. Although many people may not think they look alike, another player is often brought up when discussing these players. Earlier today, Dwight Howard, also known as the Beast, posted a photo on social media, and some fans mistook him for Kevin Durant of the Phoenix Suns. The video had the caption, "OMG, I met @KDTrey5 last night, he's such a nice person!" The Beast responded, "She mistook me for Kevin Durant?" In his IG post, he added, "I told her I'm Rick James," accompanied by disappointed and crying emojis. The video showed his expression of resignation. Rick James was a popular singer-songwriter from 1964 to 1990, but he passed away in 2004.
