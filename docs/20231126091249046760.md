  In a podcast, Los Angeles Clippers player Paul George talked about his teammate Russell Westbrook. According to previous reports, Westbrook had voluntarily requested to be a substitute in games.

 PG said, "We were going through a losing streak and weren't sure how to win, and he (Westbrook) took the initiative to say, 'You know what sacrifices I will make, I will do my best to make it work, and come off the bench.' It shows what kind of person he is.

 "I have worked with him on different teams and I know him well, but he always surprises me. It's a new feeling every day. Hats off to him.

 "It's not an easy decision, especially when you still have a lot of energy and value to the league." Talking about the team's six-game losing streak.

 PG said, "The six-game losing streak was frustrating, especially playing with so many talented players.

 But we are positive and optimistic, we believe it will work. No one likes to compete hard and ultimately lose, but the best thing about this team is that we enjoy the process, we don't panic, we enjoy finding solutions.

 We have a big goal, we believe we can do something special together, and we think it will happen. We will figure it out, I think we played well against the Nuggets and we will eventually show it."
