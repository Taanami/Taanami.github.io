 Observation of the Hangzhou Asian Games: Chinese men's basketball team's dismal three-point performance and bumpy collaboration lead to a narrow victory over Mongolia to advance to the top 12.

At halftime, Mongolia surprisingly led by one point, leaving the entire team puzzled. The overall strength of the Chinese men's basketball team was clearly much higher than their own, yet they started the game in such a low state, which must have left their path to the top in a state of uncertainty.

Key players for the Chinese team included Abasi with 18 points and 6 rebounds, Atno with 27 points and 8 rebounds, and Zeng Wendong with 6 assists and 3 rebounds, with a plus-minus value of +14. Putting aside the coaching staff, there are a few players who did not meet the national team's level of play. The first is Li Dewei, who has not been able to perform in the Asian Games stage as he did in his club team. He failed to create enough space off the ball and his poor defense allowed opponents to easily get past him. His usual high post strategy also resulted in frequent turnovers.

The second player is Li Qiwei, who is known as a 3&D player, which is exactly what the Chinese team lacks. He was supposed to lock down the opponents' backcourt, but more often than not, he was easily beaten by their guards. His inability to make open three-point shots was a major disrespect to the coach who gave him playing time.

The third player is Lu Junxiang, who has proven during his time with the Fubon Braves that he is not a player who can handle the ball well. However, the coach did not come up with effective tactics for him to score, making him a dispensable player. His weak help defense and switching concept made him seem like a headless fly on the court, which is a result of conflicts between the coach's system-building and player selection.

Lastly, the coaching staff. In a short-term international tournament, the coach should choose players who are in good form to play. However, it seemed like the coaches were giving the players time to warm up and hoping they would improve throughout the game. This resulted in a close victory against a team with a large gap in strength. The coaching staff should be quicker in their response to situations, and if the 6 minutes of playing time given to Li Qiwei had been given to Xie Yaxun, it would have been more beneficial for the team's offense. Xie's ability to score immediately after coming on the court would have made him a priority player. Therefore, the coaching staff was also one of the main reasons for the chaos in the final group game. There was no clear defensive focus throughout the game, such as which player to limit or how to switch and defend in different areas. This lack of defensive communication allowed the opponents to easily cut to the free-throw line for easy scoring opportunities or to draw a foul. These defensive weaknesses were not corrected in time, and they will likely reappear in the next game against Kazakhstan. It will be up to the coaching staff to respond quickly, otherwise the team will have a hard time on both ends of the court.

Continuing with the offensive capabilities of the team, it is clear that all the scorers need to contribute. Liu Zheng, Lu Junxiang, Xie Yaxun, Wu Yongsheng, and Lin Tingqian are all primarily scorers. From today's game, it is evident that Abasi has once again proven himself as the team's top scorer. Not to mention how poorly he was able to handle the ball against the Chinese team, his physicality allowed him to draw fouls and score from the paint, and his first-line defense was crucial for the team. Fortunately, he carried the team in scoring and rebounding in the second half, or else the team would have only made 5 three-pointers with a 26% shooting percentage, compared to Mongolia's 38% shooting percentage with 11 made three-pointers out of 29 attempts.

This is also the key factor that allowed Mongolia to lead and keep the game close. Luckily, their last three-point attempt did not go in, or else the game would have gone into overtime and the outcome would have been uncertain.

However, I would like to thank Lin Tingqian for taking on the heavy responsibility of controlling the ball. Without him, the team's scorers would have been useless. He also sacrificed his own scoring abilities. In this game, he hit a crucial corner three-pointer, which made up for his previous offensive mistakes. In the upcoming game against Kazakhstan, the main challenge will be dealing with their five two-meter tall players. Regardless of their skill level, the Chinese men's basketball team's lack of height means they will have a hard time relying on speed. With the current poor three-point shooting performance, their chances of winning are slim. If they can improve their three-point shooting to a 35% shooting percentage with at least 10 made three-pointers, they might have a chance against Kazakhstan.

Personally, I hope to see the Chinese team run smoothly, with fast breaks leading to layups and a 50% three-point shooting percentage. Then, it will be possible to give Xie Yaxun more playing time. It is clear that the Xinjiang Flying Tigers do not need much dribbling to create open shots, but instead rely on cutting and off-ball movement to create space. This is a display of teamwork and also shows the value of Zeng Wendong, who is still a role model for Taiwanese big men. Unfortunately, due to his age, he cannot stay on the court for long periods of time. Otherwise, Coach Sun Maosen would have surely wanted him to play as the point center.
