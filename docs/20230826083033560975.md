On the last day of the Jones Cup, the second-to-last game featured the Chinese White Team against the Iranian Team. The Chinese White Team's last win was on the previous Sunday's game, so their goal for today was definitely to end the tournament with a victory and leave a good impression. The Chinese White Team continued their good momentum from yesterday's game against the South Korean Team, performing better both offensively and defensively than in their previous losses. They took a 12-6 lead, with Ma Jianhao, Chen Fanbayi, and Hong Kaijie making shots from the perimeter. The first quarter ended with the Chinese White Team leading 25-15.

In the second quarter, the White Team maintained their lead with two fast break points and a three-pointer from Hong Kaijie. The Iranian Team's offense awakened in this quarter, repeatedly scoring from outside the three-point line. The White Team called two timeouts to address this issue and temporarily held an 8-point lead at halftime. In the second half, the Ho brothers continued to contribute to the White Team's scoring record, but the Iranian Team still put significant pressure on them, demonstrating patience in handling every possession. With a little over 3 minutes left, Ma Jianhao's fast break dunk ignited the emotions of the home fans, but unfortunately, it didn't reduce the Iranian Team's scoring in this quarter. The third quarter ended with a 3-point difference, entering the decisive quarter.

At the start of the final quarter, Herdan immediately hit two consecutive three-pointers, and Herbo's fast break dunk broke the stalemate of the game. Shortly after, Ma Jianhao made another three-pointer, extending the White Team's lead to 6 points with 2 minutes remaining.

At a critical moment, with 1 minute and 29 seconds left, Ma Jianhao scored a turnaround fadeaway shot. Bai Yaocheng made a left-side cut to score, evading the defender, but when the White Team had an 8-point lead, they allowed the Iranian Team to score three-pointers and make fouls on drives, reducing the deficit to 2 points. Then, a turnover occurred during a backcourt inbound pass with 2 points remaining.

Fortunately, after the Iranian timeout, the White Team successfully defended against the Iranian Team's offense. Chen Fanbayi calmly made two free throws after being fouled. The Iranian Team missed their shot again, and the game ended with a 91-86 victory for the White Team, finally breaking their five-game losing streak. In this tournament, the Chinese White Team achieved 3 wins and 5 losses. Herbo scored the highest with 18 points, Herdan and Ma Jianhao both scored 14 points, Chen Fanbayi scored 13 points, and Banba contributed 10 points.
