 Latest development in the trade of NBA player Damian Lillard, the Toronto Raptors are recognized as one of the buyers.

The saga of Damian Lillard has been ongoing since the end of June, lasting almost three months. While the Miami Heat have been identified as one of the potential destinations for Lillard, recently there have been other teams expressing interest in acquiring him. The Toronto Raptors are one of the teams believed to be vying for Lillard's services. According to reporter Matt Moore on the Locked on NBA podcast, several teams in the Eastern Conference are interested in pursuing Lillard, and the Raptors are one of them. While there is no discussion about whether the Raptors are actively pursuing Lillard, other teams have already recognized the Raptors' desire to trade for him.

The Raptors have a history of pursuing superstar players in the league, such as Kawhi Leonard, and it resulted in the team winning their first-ever championship. Masai Ujiri, who was instrumental in that acquisition, is still with the Raptors. This season, the Raptors lost Fred VanVleet and although they signed Dennis Schroder, there is still a need for a point guard to some extent. On the other hand, there are reports suggesting that the Miami Heat may not be willing to offer a significant package in exchange for Lillard. This can be seen as a challenge to the Portland Trail Blazers, as it remains to be seen if they can find a better trade package in the market.
