 NBALillard suits up for the Bucks for the second time in a game against the Thunder, but only scores 5 points in 25 minutes and the Bucks fall to the Thunder. 

Today's preseason game between the Bucks and Thunder saw Damian Lillard wearing the Bucks jersey for the second time. However, he did not have a great shooting night, scoring only 5 points compared to his 14 points in the previous game against the Lakers. He shot 2 for 11 from the field and 0 for 5 from the three-point line, and the Bucks ultimately lost to the Thunder. It was evident that Lillard has not fully integrated with his new teammates yet, and there were few moments of collaboration with Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Greek Freak mostly relied on his low-post scoring and fast breaks to showcase his athleticism. Lillard and Antetokounmpo will need more time to adjust to each other's rhythm on the offensive end. 

The Thunder had a better performance in this game, with all players getting playing time. They never trailed the Bucks and had a 46.2% three-point shooting percentage, making 18 three-pointers in total. Josh Giddey, Chet Holmgren, and Jalen Williams were the standout players for the Thunder, all shooting over 50% from the field. Giddey finished with 19 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists, while Holmgren had 18 points, 3 rebounds, and 3 assists. Williams also contributed 18 points and 6 rebounds.

Both the Bucks and Thunder have one more preseason game left. The Bucks will face the Grizzlies on Saturday (Taiwan time), while the Thunder will play the Pistons in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Friday.
