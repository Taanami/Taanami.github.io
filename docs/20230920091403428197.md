September 8, 2023, 14:53 - United Daily News: This year's Cross-League Basketball Invitational Tournament has officially unveiled the seven participating teams.

Last year, the first edition of the Cross-League Basketball Invitational Tournament took place, and this year, it was announced that the second edition will be held on September 16. Today, the participating teams have been officially announced, including SBL Taisin, Taiwan Beer, and Changhua Bank Power, as well as the alliance formed by PLG Dream Team and Yoyo Army from the Dual Basketball League. The T1 League will be represented solely by the new team, Taipei Taisin War Gods. As for the UBA champion, National Chengchi University will also be participating in the tournament. Last year, the Cross-League Basketball Tournament, led by the Chinese Basketball Association, was held for the first time, with teams from all three domestic leagues participating. This year's second edition has confirmed the participation of seven teams, including SBL Taisin, Taiwan Beer, Changhua Bank Power, PLG Dream Team and Yoyo Army alliance, Chinese Asian Games Training Team, T1 League Taipei Taisin War Gods, and UBA National Chengchi University. Although the participation of Dual Basketball League teams is not enthusiastic, they still generate considerable attention. This includes National Chengchi University, who publicly won three consecutive championships in the UBA Men's First Division and will now challenge professional teams. Another point of interest is whether Lin Ping-Sheng, who has recently been involved in contract disputes, will make his debut representing Taipei Taisin War Gods, his new team.
