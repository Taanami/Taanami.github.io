Although most of the team's performance was subpar, after the first explosive play, the Timberwolves immediately focused on rebounding with Gobert as their core. They only allowed the Raptors to grab 8 offensive rebounds throughout the game, which is commendable considering the team's improved physical condition.

The team's poor plus-minus can be attributed to the chaotic offensive system. The fast breaks after steals were also comical, but the team's awareness of creating space on both ends of the court and protecting the rim, allowed the Raptors, who are not known for their 3-point shooting, to attempt more 3-pointers with favorable results. It is unimaginable how this team would fare without Conley leading the reins, and it would likely be a one-on-one hell.

In the middle of the third quarter, after a timeout, the ball was given to the veteran coach. The familiar horn and pick-and-roll tactics from the preseason began to work, leading to a smoother and more harmonious ball movement. How to manage ball possession and energy throughout the long season will be a challenge for Finch.

The Bad:

KAT's impatience and poor decision-making disappointed all the fans who expected him to continue his preseason performance.

Although Ant scored 12 points with a 60% field goal percentage in the first quarter, his tendency to overdribble and take tough shots was already showing.

Especially when the rest of the team's 3-point shooting was not working, instead of trying to integrate into the team's tactics and take easier shots, Ant would often just dribble past half-court and go for a solo drive, making it difficult for his four teammates to even touch the ball. With more turnovers than assists and constantly attacking the rim in triple coverage, it was the familiar Ant that fans know, but as the team's star player, he must learn when to take the right shots.

The same can be said for KAT, who needs to make quicker decisions, but against the Raptors' tall and aggressive defense, his recently activated brain seems to have slowed down. His hesitation before making a move resulted in a poor 32% field goal percentage, at least three missed 3-pointers, and awkward plays where he purposely tried to connect with Gobert even though Poeltl was retreating.

Including the disastrous turnover in the last possession, it is clear that KAT was playing with frustration. If not for his opportunity to dominate Siakam in the post, his stats would have been even more dreadful. The chaotic performances of the two star players disrupted the team's offensive strategy that they tried in the preseason. Although a portion of the team's poor first-half offensive efficiency can be attributed to NAW's unusual shooting slump and the Raptors' excellent perimeter defense, the rest of the Timberwolves players, except for Conley, seemed to have forgotten about the team's system and only relied on their hustle.

This led to more transition opportunities for the calm and collected Raptors, while the Timberwolves' two big men were left watching as Siakam and Barnes attacked their smaller defenders with their size.

Shake Milton is still trying to find his rhythm, and his lost defensive assignments and seemingly aimless play were already evident in the preseason. However, as a new member of the team and not known for his defense, he should not be blamed too harshly. NAW's shot selection was correct, but the Raptors' constant switching and drop defense strategy made it difficult for him to replicate his World Cup performance.

The Future:

After the Timberwolves finished the preseason with the league's best assist numbers, Chris Finch mentioned in a media interview: "Don't overanalyze it; we'll see if it works when the spotlight is on."

However, compared to the Raptors, who also had an impressive preseason, the Timberwolves' performance was a major warning sign.

It is not necessarily a bad thing to realize your weaknesses early on in an away game, especially since the team is still missing Jaden McDaniels in the frontcourt. Hopefully, before facing the Heat, another defensive powerhouse, at home, the Wolves can regain their focus from the preseason.

It is also worth noting how the Timberwolves will finish the game with what lineup. The SloMo-KAT-Gobert lineup puts too much pressure on the ball handler, and SloMo's role as a secondary playmaker is not a replacement for KAT's decision-making. Will Finch give up the two big men in crucial moments and let Slo-Mo play the power forward position? This will be something to pay attention to in future games.
