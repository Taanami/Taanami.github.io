 Germany celebrated wildly as they defeated the United States in the semi-finals of the World Cup, securing a spot in the championship game. When the final buzzer sounded, the German players excitedly embraced each other, while the American team looked dejected and said nothing. The entire German team was ecstatic in their moment of victory, while Tyrese Haliburton of the United States covered his face in disappointment until Austin Reaves approached him for a handshake. Germany will face Serbia, who defeated Canada today, in the World Cup championship game, while the United States will compete against Canada in the third-place match.
