  PLEAGUE Preseason Game in Keelung, Cross-League Matches at Peace Basketball Gymnasium, Score Schedule

As the domestic basketball scene is in turmoil, the Chinese national team is preparing for the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games at the end of this month. The basketball environment in Taiwan hasn't stopped either. P. LEAGUE+ has announced the information for the 2023-24 preseason games, and the cross-league matches that debuted last year will continue this year. Not only will the Taipei Taiwan Beer Fighting God, a new team in the T1 League, participate, but also the National Taiwan University, who completed a three-peat in the University Basketball Association (UBA). Taiwanese basketball is busy during this offseason. The recently concluded William Jones Cup invitation tournament, which resumed after a three-year hiatus, and the Chinese Taipei delegation for the Chengdu World University Games have finalized their schedules. However, due to the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Damascus, Syria, being classified as a red alert travel destination in Taiwan, our country has decided to withdraw from the tournament. The training teams, which were originally made up of T1 League players, have disbanded. Please continue reading.

In addition to the teams that participated in the Jones Cup, there are two other teams representing Taiwan: Team Blue and Team White. Team Blue consists of current national team members and will also compete in the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games. In the later stages of the Jones Cup, there is still an ongoing contract dispute between Lin Ping-hsuan and the P. LEAGUE+ Hsinchu JKO Lioneers and the T1 League Taipei Taiwan Beer Fighting God. The Lioneers have filed a lawsuit this week, and both parties will appear in court. The Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology basketball team also faced negative news of their former head coach instructing an assistant to vandalize a car. Among all this news, it is evident that the offseason of Taiwanese basketball is far from idle. (Image source: P. LEAGUE+)

Today, P. LEAGUE+ announced the schedule for the 2023-24 preseason games. Last year's preseason games were held at the Fengshan Gymnasium, home of the Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology basketball team. This year, the Steel Basketball team remains the preseason game partner, but the venue has been relocated from the harbor city to Keelung, also known as the "rain city." The games will take place from October 7th to 9th, with a total of six matches, bringing adult-level basketball games back to Keelung after many years.

During the last offseason, P. LEAGUE+, T1 League, and SBL jointly participated in cross-league matches. The Taiwan Beer Bears from the T1 League defeated the Xinbei Citibank Attackers to win the championship. After the introduction of P. LEAGUE+ and T1 League, there are now three leagues/competitions for Taiwanese basketball to compete and learn from each other. Although the matches are mostly for training purposes, they are still highly anticipated. There have been rumors that the cross-league matches will continue after various international tournaments, and it has been confirmed that seven teams will participate. The SBL will be represented by Taiwan Bank, Changhua Bank, and Taiwan Beer. P. LEAGUE+ will form an alliance with Dreamers and Fubon Braves. The T1 League will have the highly talked-about Taipei Taiwan Beer Fighting God. Additionally, there will be a Chinese Taipei Asian Games training team and the National Taiwan University participating.

SBL teams participated in cross-league matches last year and showed strong competitiveness. They will participate again this year. After making headlines during the offseason, the newly formed T1 League Taipei Taiwan Beer Fighting God will finally make their debut in actual games, and it will be interesting to see how they perform and if Lin Ping-hsuan will play. As for the National Taiwan University, which has dominated the UBA for the past three seasons and is known as the "Universally Powerful Political University," it remains to be seen if they can demonstrate excellent performance against higher-level teams in preparation for the new UBA season. This is also a hot topic of discussion. The score schedule for the cross-league matches is as follows:
