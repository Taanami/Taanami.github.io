  Interview with Zhiping High School, the team of the 2023 TGF Firefighting Cup Basketball Tournament

Zhiping High School has been participating in the Firefighting Cup since 2021, and they ended their journey in the preliminary rounds of the northern region. After the cancellation of the tournament in 2022 due to the pandemic, they took on the challenge again this year and won both the northern region and the national finals in the single school division. Despite facing tough opponents from all directions, Zhiping High School overcame numerous obstacles. During the southern region finals, the team encountered some difficulties and experienced a setback in the first two days. However, they successfully adjusted and found their rhythm on the third day. In the championship game against Kaohsiung High School of Science and Technology, they achieved sweet revenge and brought the national title back to the northern region after 2018.

Zhiping High School already had a Class A team, but due to the system, they couldn't form a team consisting of regular students to participate in the Class B league. However, these basketball enthusiasts continue to work hard for their passion. They started the team about 5 years ago, with seven freshmen as the core players this year, along with five seniors. Many of them were participating in the Firefighting Cup for the first time, and this new experience brought a completely different playing style and atmosphere.

When asked about the most memorable games in the northern region and national finals, 16-year-old Yu Mengxun said, "In the preliminary rounds, we knew that winning the game would secure our spot in the top four. However, due to our own mistakes, we lost. But in the finals, we had another chance to face Kaohsiung High School of Science and Technology. We improved on our previous shortcomings, increased our three-point shooting percentage, and most importantly, the coach changed our defensive strategy. It was only after adjusting on both ends of the court that we were able to achieve victory and successfully redeem ourselves."

However, Zhiping High School faced some challenges when they traveled to the southern region. The players admitted that they were too relaxed in the first two games of the national tournament, making the first win a difficult one. In the second game, they made too many mistakes and couldn't make the necessary adjustments in time, resulting in a loss. From the third game onwards, they gradually improved their previous issues and became more aggressive in defense. In the semifinals, they reached the expected level of performance. Even after the games, they would discuss the problems they encountered and how to make corrections. With everyone providing feedback and making timely adjustments, along with their growing cohesion, they ultimately achieved the championship.

In addition, Chen Liyu, who was awarded the Finals MVP, made a lasting impression by contributing offensively during crucial moments of the championship game. Yu Mengxun, who had already won the MVP in the preliminary rounds, also became the assist leader in the finals. Zhang Enqi, on the other hand, became the steals leader, becoming one of the biggest winners in the single school division. The synergy between these three players played a key role in Zhiping High School's championship victory.

Coach Huang Defeng, who led the team to victory, was also awarded the Best Coach by the tournament organizers. When talking about this year's journey, Coach Huang said, "I am grateful to the Firefighting Cup for providing such a great stage for these young players to showcase and prove themselves. We didn't expect to win the championship this year, especially compared to last year when we had better physical conditions and experience. However, the trust, unity, and fighting spirit displayed by the players on and off the court are the most touching and proud aspects for me and Coach Wu Zhengxian."

Zhiping High School is grateful to the Firefighting Cup for providing this platform for the players to be seen. They would also like to express special thanks to the school's chairman and parents for taking special care of the student-athletes, allowing them to focus on training and pursue their passion without any worries. They hope that the team can achieve a consecutive championship next year.
