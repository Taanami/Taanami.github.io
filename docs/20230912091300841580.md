 Chat after the United States lost to Lithuania

The United States team lost the game... but was it that serious? First of all, in terms of substance, the author believes that the significance of this defeat is not very important. Please continue reading because the United States does not value the World Cup (including its predecessor, the FIBA World Championship) as much as the Olympics, so naturally their performance is not as good. Here are the results of the United States team (don't call them the Dream Team, it's unfair to the players) after NBA players were allowed to participate:

Olympics: 92🥇, 96🥇, 00🥇, 04🥉, 08🥇, 12🥇, 16🥇, 20🥇 (a total of 7 gold and 1 bronze, experienced 3 losses in 2004 and 1 loss in 2020)

World Cup (including its predecessor, the FIBA World Championship): 94🥇, 98🥉, 026️⃣, 06🥉, 10🥇, 14🥇, 197️⃣ (a total of 3 gold and 2 bronze, in 1998, the team was composed of players from the minor league or those playing overseas due to NBA labor disputes; in 2002, they experienced 3 losses on home soil; in 2006, they experienced 1 loss; in 2019, they experienced 2 losses)

So why does the United States still make such efforts to form a team for the competition? Is it to promote national prestige? It may have been the case when they were still the Dream Team, but after basketball globalized, the strength of various countries has rapidly approached, so promoting national prestige is obviously not something the current United States can easily achieve. The author believes that the goal is still for the Olympics, especially after FIBA made the World Cup a way to qualify for the Olympics, countries have attached more importance to the World Cup than before. In this World Cup, FIBA will generate 7 Olympic tickets based on the ranking of participating countries in each continent: the top two in Europe, the top two in the Americas (United States and Canada), the top team in Asia (Japan), the top team in Africa (South Sudan), and the top team in Oceania (Australia). Therefore, the author believes that the main goal of the United States team in this competition has already been achieved, which is to secure a ticket to the Paris Olympics.

Next, it is to train players for the Olympics next year. First, in the big man department: JJJ may not be a towering figure and may not necessarily be able to defend against big men from Europe or Australia, but his ability to protect the rim, help defense, and transition between offense and defense are all suitable for the United States team... His current problem is to handle fouls well and stabilize his outside shooting to create spacing.

Next is the United States team's attacking main force - the wings. I think A. Edwards' performance in this competition has already proved that he is at least a version of Kobe for the United States team, if not Wade.

However, in the past, the United States team had big wings like Melo or KD, but they are not seen in this team, which is a big crisis. The benefits of having big wings in the past are as follows: they can directly pull up for a shot from the outside after receiving the ball, and their three-point shooting is almost unstoppable and deadly. Moreover, compared to other countries' players in the paint, the United States' big wings may have a slight disadvantage in height, but they have relatively superior physical conditions and can also be used to support the paint when necessary. This year, the highly anticipated small KD - B. Ingram, unexpectedly disappointed everyone, performing poorly from warm-up games to the main competition.

As for Paolo Banchero, I hope Kerr doesn't treat him as a big man. It would be better to train him as an international forward with his skills.
