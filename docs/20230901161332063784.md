 The efforts that can be made in the T1 S3 pre-season draft may be more than in the previous draft with fewer moves.

After the T1 S3-04 pre-season draft, the special situations in both leagues have deepened some of the issues. Although the other league also has problems to face, T1 has also generated many areas for consideration. In this article, the author will explore the current situation of the league from three aspects: "not choosing any rookies," "prioritizing immediate effectiveness," and "the impact of foreign player system." The author will share some opinions with everyone. Please continue reading ▼

Choosing not to play if there is no playing time, is it an excuse or a plan? The focus of this draft was almost exclusively on Taiwan Steel Eagles giving up the draft in the first round. GM Qian Wei Cheng and head coach Liu Meng Zhu mentioned in interviews that the team still has players to develop, so they did not want to make forced selections and were concerned about affecting the players' development. In addition, there are restrictions on rookie signing contracts, so they decided to give up this draft. From these words, it is clear that the thinking of selecting immediate effectiveness is more prominent. However, considering the current situation, there was not much opportunity for teams with lower draft positions, and with players like Gu Mao Wei Jia and Han Jie Yu to develop, the author can understand this choice. However, along with the fact that both leagues have fewer players joining the draft, it has sparked discussions about the system and the thinking of the teams.

From the author's perspective, completely giving up the draft is not a good move. The most significant consideration is definitely "funds." Rather than investing in uncertain rookies, it is better to save them and use them in the free market.

Such thinking is common in professional sports, but it may not be a good phenomenon for Taiwan, which does not have other mature secondary league environments. It is not necessary to provide actual playing time to grow. If there is adaptability and understanding, practicing with the team can also lead to progress. Time for adjustment can also allow players to smoothly integrate into the team's system. This is the bonus that goes beyond the performance of professional sports and can ensure a continuous supply of talent for the national team. If the goal is only to find experienced players to join the team, with the aim of competing for championships, it is not wrong. However, it is not beneficial for the overall development of the environment. Unless the three leagues discuss and merge or establish a hierarchical system to integrate a more orderly system, the problem may not be so significant. But in the absence of such a situation, it is better for teams to take on the responsibility of nurturing rookies.

Although we don't know the true intentions of Taiwan Steel, it is still possible to receive rookies in the case of not choosing. There is a channel because those who are not selected become free agents and can negotiate lower salaries or not be limited by contract years. They may even choose to train without receiving payment. Invisibly, the system becomes an endorsement that favors the labor side, which is what the author meant by "plan." Please continue reading.

Of course, as the author has mentioned many times, professional sports is an industry based on business. It is not wrong for teams to think and operate in this way. However, from the perspective of the overall environment, continuous development is not ideal. Currently, the players' level is not sufficient, and if no one is willing to nurture them, a gap will appear over time, and it may even interrupt the motivation of those players in the intermediate level who want to move up to a higher level.

Therefore, whether the league can observe this phenomenon and discuss adjustments with the teams will lead to better development and benefits for the players. It can also bring more motivation for players to pursue their dreams, which is what we expect and want to see.▼

The demand for immediate effectiveness or the long-term operation mindset. In the draft of the two professional leagues this year, both exhibited a mindset that prioritized immediate effectiveness, and the idea of nurturing players or long-term development was diminished. From the author's perspective, although the number of players is gradually saturating, their abilities have not reached a level where they can significantly affect the team's performance and strength. There are still many imbalances in each team's capabilities.

Short-term speculation in professional sports is not a problem since there is no salary cap yet. Teams can invest heavily and become evil empires, not caring about rookies and only focusing on star players or experienced players in the competition. However, this cannot bring benefits to the long-term development of the environment.

Considering this, integrating or positioning the roles of each league is probably the problem to be faced in the future. In addition to the excitement of the games, the cultivation of talent pool will be another consideration. Just like professional baseball has the first and second teams or the social team system, and Japan's B LEAGUE has a grading system, perhaps "farm teams" will be the next point of consideration for Taiwanese basketball. The long-term operation of the SBL may be the best solution.

If most teams believe that the UBA cannot cultivate immediate effectiveness, another feasible model the author has considered is to cooperate with the basketball association and require players participating in the professional draft to have at least one year of experience in the SBL. This way, they can start from the farm teams to gain experience and provide teams with more observation periods. It will also enable players to showcase their performance in a higher-intensity league, bringing more competition and screening effectiveness. Even if they are not favored by teams, players can choose to continue to hone their skills. Combining this with the recent mention by the basketball association about companies wanting to expand teams, it may be a viable solution. Lastly, instead of focusing solely on immediate effectiveness, the long-term cultivation system operation is actually more important. Players are not magic potions or shape-shifters. It cannot be assumed that they can adapt to any system in the shortest time. Different coaches' guidance will produce various team styles. There are teams like Special Forces and Sea Gods that emphasize the system, and there are teams like the Sun and Clouded Leopards that allow players to play their natural game. But regardless of which style it is, it takes time to adapt, especially for rookies who are experiencing professional sports for the first time.

Instead of rushing to put them in the game and eliminating them if they don't perform well, it may be more mature for players to fully understand the team's system before stepping onto the court. It can also provide them with a longer opportunity for survival. However, that requires teams to invest in long-term cultivation, which is actually a thankless task.
