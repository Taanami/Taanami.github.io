  PLG Flying Ape Coaching Team Strengthens with New Addition - Ma Yi-Hong as Assistant Coach

The Taoyuan Puyuan Flying Apes announced today (10/11) the addition of former national women's basketball player Ma Yi-Hong to their coaching team for the upcoming season.

Ma Yi-Hong, who previously played for WSBL (Women's Super Basketball League) teams Chunghwa Telecom and Taiyuan, was also a key player for the national team and has played for China's WCBA (Women's Chinese Basketball Association) team Heilongjiang. After retiring in 2015, she served as an assistant coach for the men's basketball team at National Taiwan Sport University and as an assistant coach for the Taiwan Steel Falcons. Ma Yi-Hong's transition from player to coach has been marked by her dedication and continuous efforts to improve herself. Speaking about joining the Taoyuan Puyuan Flying Apes as an assistant coach, Ma Yi-Hong said, "Courage is not the absence of fear, but knowing that the decision you make is more important than being afraid." She also added, "As I embark on this new journey, I hope to bring a different perspective through my gender and I am excited to join the Flying Apes family and look forward to the upcoming season."

Ma Yi-Hong's addition strengthens the Flying Apes' coaching team. Head coach Zhang Zhao-Ming expressed that Ma Yi-Hong is a dynamic and passionate player on the court and an excellent coach, and he believes that her presence will bring more strength and influence to the team. Ma Yi-Hong will also work together with current assistant coach Lin Shu-Wei to assist in the team's training and games.

As the new season approaches, the Flying Apes coaching team will continue to strive for excellence with a stronger lineup. We look forward to Ma Yi-Hong's contribution in her new role with her professional knowledge and experience, and we anticipate many surprises and achievements from the team.
