 Recently, veteran media personality Craig Kilborn and Timberwolves reporter Dane Moore shared a story about Anthony Edwards. They talked about Edwards' interaction with MLB legend and Timberwolves owner Alex Rodriguez and how they became good friends.

"A-ROD tried to establish a relationship with Edwards," Kilborn said. "At first, Edwards didn't know A-ROD, but they have become good friends now. One time, Edwards called A-ROD directly and asked him, 'I have something to ask you... how did you end up breaking up with Jennifer Lopez?' That's how he asked. He did it."

"That's just Edwards, right? Isn't that interesting?" Kilborn added.

Alex Rodriguez was in a relationship with actress Jennifer Lopez in 2017 and even got engaged in 2019. However, the two broke up in 2021, and Lopez later married actor Ben Affleck. Edwards had an outstanding performance in the first round of the playoffs against the Nuggets this year, averaging 31.6 points, 5 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per game. The Timberwolves also signed Edwards to a five-year contract worth up to $260 million during the off-season. Edwards also represented the USA in the World Cup this year and was named to the All-Tournament team.
