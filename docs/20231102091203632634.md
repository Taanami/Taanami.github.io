  Knowing Your Weaknesses: Chinese Team Loses by 20 Points to China

In this game, China started with Zhao Rui, Du Runwang, Cui Yongxi, Hu Jinqiu, and Zhu Junlong, while key players Zhang Zhenlin, Hu Mingxuan, and Wang Zhelin were on the bench. It seems that China's strategy for the group stage is to let young players gain experience first and then switch to their main players when needed. The Chinese team initially took advantage of the opportunity and led 7-5 in the beginning.

However, as China increased their defensive pressure, the Chinese team began to struggle on the offensive end. They started making some poor offensive choices, such as Lu Junxian repeatedly being blocked while attempting to drive after a screen, and Zeng Xiangjun hesitating to attack the basket and instead attempting difficult mid-range shots that were all missed.

In the second half of the first quarter, the Chinese team fell into a long scoring drought. Facing China's higher-intensity defense, the pick-and-roll combination of Lin Tingqian and Atino became ineffective. The Chinese players' footwork in screening was unmatched by Hong Kong or Chinese Taipei players, making Atino's screening less effective. This allowed the defender to always stay in front of Lin Tingqian, making it difficult for him to pass to open teammates in time, resulting in delayed passes and the defender being able to recover and defend. Additionally, China's three-point shooting was much better in this game compared to their previous game, with a 48% three-point shooting percentage. The Chinese team tried to use a zone defense to limit the pressure in the paint, but China's accurate three-point shooting was unexpected. Du Runwang made 5 out of 8 three-pointers, helping China build a lead early on. The Chinese team's rotation on defense still needs improvement, as they often left open spaces on the perimeter due to trying to help defend against drives, allowing China to make open three-point shots.

In addition, China's substitute Zhao Jiwei displayed his speed and steady ball handling skills, causing trouble for the Chinese team's defense. He scored 19 points, grabbed 5 rebounds, and dished out 7 assists, constantly running past the Chinese team's defense during their offensive struggles and finding open teammates or scoring himself.

Although some may criticize Atino for not defending on the perimeter, I personally agree with his decision to stay in the paint. If he were to defend on the perimeter, there would be almost no one left to defend China's inside players. Atino did a good job controlling his emotions in this game and fulfilled his role as a protector of the paint.

The Chinese team's rebounding was not inferior to China's, thanks to Atino's ability to box out and limit the Chinese team's center. He also grabbed 6 offensive rebounds on the offensive end, creating problems for China's defense and giving his teammates opportunities to score from the outside.

Today, Atino truly lived up to his nickname of "God of Defense." Source: Chinese Olympic Committee The Chinese team's main source of offense came from their defense and fast breaks. Liu Zheng and Abass constantly applied pressure on the Chinese players, disrupting their offensive rhythm and causing them to miss shots, which the Chinese team converted into fast break points. Abass also used his speed to score in transition.

He displayed the Chinese team's most scarce individual offensive ability. Despite facing taller Chinese players, he was still able to score with his pace and athleticism. However, he needs to improve on controlling the tempo, as he had 4 turnovers in this game which wasted scoring opportunities.

Facing a strong opponent like China, it is not surprising that the Chinese team lost. The key is for us to recognize our weaknesses and find ways to improve.

In my opinion, the biggest flaw in this game was not putting pressure on China in the backcourt. It is well known that China lacks the ability to control the tempo of their offense. If the opponent pressures their backcourt and forces them to pass the ball early, their shot selection will be greatly affected. Today, besides Liu Zheng, the other players were content with just standing in front of the Chinese players and not defending them closely. They should have put more pressure on the Chinese players, especially Zhao Jiwei who ran all over the court. Apart from Liu Zheng, the other players also need to step up on defense. Additionally, the local league players lacked confidence and could not utilize their strengths.

Lu Junxian, knowing that he was at a height disadvantage against his opponent, was constantly blocked and struggled in the beginning. Luckily, he realized this problem and started using screens to make two three-pointers, finally finding his offensive rhythm.

As for Zeng Xiangjun, his height should not be a disadvantage against anyone except for a power forward. However, he was forced to take difficult shots to avoid being blocked. He only scored 1 point in the end. Other local league players also encountered similar difficulties, becoming hesitant and playing even worse against the high-intensity game.

This should be a good opportunity for the Chinese team to gain experience. Hopefully, the players can regain their confidence on both ends of the court and prepare for more intense games in the future.
