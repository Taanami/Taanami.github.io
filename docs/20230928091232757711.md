 The Miami Heat and the Portland Trail Blazers are expected to restart trade negotiations, and the Heat are hesitating about including Caleb Martin in the package. Caleb Martin had a strong performance in the Eastern Conference Finals this year, helping the Heat defeat the Celtics in the series. According to Shams Charania's report on Damian Lillard's trade prospects, Lillard is expected to report to either the Heat or the Trail Blazers' training camp. However, according to Blazers reporter Aaron Fentress, Charania's statement is only partially correct. Fentress stated that if the Blazers reach a trade agreement with another team, Lillard will go to his new team and give his best performance. Fentress also reported Lillard's inclination towards joining the Heat, but his stance has become less firm since the league became involved in the trade discussions.
