 The Revolutionary Impact of the 2023 NBA Finals Vol.2: Three-Pointers Are No Longer a Guarantee of Victory, Nuggets' Championship Ignites the Renaissance of the League

This year's NBA Finals have been full of surprises. The Nuggets and the Heat, who made it to the finals, were not favored to reach this stage before the playoffs began. The Heat started from the play-in tournament and after losing their first game to the Hawks, they fought their way through to become the second eighth-seeded team in history to reach the NBA Finals. Similarly, the Nuggets faced adversity and defeated the Timberwolves with their twin towers, eliminated the Suns with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker, and swept the Suns led by LeBron James and Anthony Davis. They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history and lifted the championship trophy. Please continue reading to learn about the Nuggets' 46-year journey and their historic wait, which is unmatched by any other team in NBA history.

The Nuggets' key player in their championship run, Nikola Jokić, is also an atypical MVP. He was selected by the Nuggets as the 41st pick in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft. Interestingly, when his name was called, there was a Taco Bell advertisement playing during the draft broadcast.

Now, Jokić has become the first player in history to win both the regular season MVP and the NBA Finals MVP despite being drafted outside of the lottery.

The matchups and the FMVP winners mentioned above highlight the uniqueness of this year's NBA Finals, and the Nuggets and Heat's unique experiences have brought many insights to the league's ecosystem.

In this series, through four articles, we will analyze the revolutionary impact of the Nuggets and Heat series on the basketball world. The Revolutionary Impact of the 2023 NBA Finals Vol.1 - Nuggets' Championship Symbolizes the Decline of Small Ball and the Return of Big Men? Please continue reading the previous article to learn about how Jokić and the Nuggets changed people's perception of big men. This article will discuss the characteristics of this year's NBA Finals.

The fast-paced small-ball trend is prevalent in today's league, but the Nuggets go against the grain in many aspects.

This year's NBA Finals were filled with a retro vibe. The series had a pace of 91.70, making it not only the second slowest-paced series among all the playoff matchups this year but also the slowest-paced NBA Finals in the past decade. The last time an NBA Finals had such a slow pace was in the 2014 Spurs vs. Heat series (Pace 88.50). In the era of fast-paced basketball, the Nuggets and Heat's slow-paced battle stood out.

However, both teams naturally play at a slower pace. The Heat emphasize physical and aggressive defense, while the Nuggets focus on half-court organization. In terms of offensive and defensive pace in the regular season, they ranked second to last and seventh in the league, respectively. Please continue reading to learn about the defensive slugfest between the Nuggets and Heat, which resulted in low-scoring games. The Heat have consistently been one of the top defensive teams in terms of defensive efficiency in the league.

As for the Nuggets, despite having a size advantage with all five starters standing at 6 feet 4 inches (approximately 194 cm) or taller, their defensive performance in the regular season was less than ideal, ranking 15th in defensive efficiency. They were the worst-ranked championship team in the past 22 years (the 2000-01 Lakers ranked 22nd).

Fortunately, the Nuggets regained their focus in time. In the five games of the finals, they allowed the Heat to score over 100 points in only one game. From Game 3 to Game 5, the Nuggets limited their opponents to 100.0 points per 100 possessions, showcasing their best defensive performance of the season, including the regular season and playoffs.

Once again, it confirmed the iron rule that "offense wins games, but defense wins championships." In the past few years' playoffs, traditional centers have often been targeted and exploited. Rudy Gobert, wearing the Jazz jersey, was the best defensive player in the regular season but became the primary target for opponents to attack in the playoffs. In last year's NBA Finals, the Warriors constantly set screens to create opportunities for Stephen Curry against Celtics' big men Al Horford and Robert Williams III. Although Nikola Jokić's mobility is not particularly good, the coaching staff knows how to hide his weaknesses and highlight his strengths.

The Nuggets' versatile forwards and guards have above-average defensive abilities, allowing Jokić to stay in the paint without needing to switch frequently to guard the perimeter. In addition, Jokić's defensive instincts are excellent, enabling him to timely help defense and disrupt opponents' offense, performing well as a rim protector. Nice work from Jokic to get a deflection, Denver again turns defense into offense.pic.twitter.com/3VUCXsAm2s— Steve Jones Jr. (@stevejones20)June 13, 2023 Another characteristic of this year's retro-themed NBA Finals is that the Nuggets do not rely heavily on three-pointers. Attacking the paint has been the key to their success.

Although the Heat had a better three-point shooting percentage than the Nuggets in the series and made three more three-pointers per game, they couldn't make up for their lack of interior presence. The Nuggets averaged 13.6 more points in the paint than the Heat in the series, making it the largest paint scoring differential among the 15 playoff series this year. It also set a new record for the largest paint scoring differential in the NBA Finals in the past 23 years. The last time there was such a disparity in interior scoring between the two teams was in the 2000 NBA Finals, where Shaquille O'Neal's Lakers averaged 21.3 more points in the paint than the Pacers.
