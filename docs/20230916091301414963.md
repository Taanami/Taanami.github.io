 Can James Harden and Damian Lillard be traded next season?

With the Philadelphia 76ers and the Portland Trail Blazers being eliminated early in the playoffs and regular season respectively, their star players James Harden and Damian Lillard have both requested trades. The situations for the two players are slightly different. Harden publicly accused the team's general manager, Daryl Morey, of being a fraud during his trip to Shanghai in the offseason, and stated that he would no longer work with Morey. More details can be found in the previous article by the author.

Lillard has always been the face of the Portland Trail Blazers and the hope of the fans, especially after the careers of Greg Oden and Brandon Roy were ruined by injuries. The team has built around Lillard as the core, bringing in many supporting players. For example, the year after Lillard was drafted, CJ McCollum was also drafted, forming one of the most powerful backcourt duos in addition to the Splash Brothers. In subsequent years, the team acquired Jusuf Nurkic from the Denver Nuggets in 2018 to become their starting center, and traded for Josh Hart and Jerami Grant from the Detroit Pistons in 2022 to improve their backcourt defense. These actions demonstrate the Trail Blazers' determination to win a championship with their star player Lillard. Not only has the team made efforts, but Lillard himself has made game-winning shots in crucial moments, leading the team to victory. For example, in the sixth game of the first round in 2014, he hit a game-winning shot against the Houston Rockets, and in the fifth game of the first round in 2019, he hit a game-winning shot against Paul George, who was a contender for MVP that year, leading the team to the second round. Lillard has also played through injuries in recent years, often struggling to sleep at night due to the pain. This proves Lillard's abilities and loyalty. However, after several years of losses and the selection of talented young guards Shaedon Sharpe and Scoot Henderson in the past two years, the Trail Blazers seem to be indirectly telling Lillard that there is no longer a place for him in their new era. This has led Lillard to indirectly express his desire to be traded.

Next, let's discuss the trade value of these two players and where they might go. First, let's talk about James Harden. Harden is currently 34 years old and his salary is around $35 million. He will enter free agency next year, so trading him now would only give a team one year of his services. One of the reasons Harden may be so upset with Morey is likely because he couldn't get a max contract. For Harden, who will be 35 when the free agency market opens next year, he probably wants to secure one last big contract, especially considering the rumors that his former team, the Houston Rockets, is interested in bringing him back. Looking at the Rockets' salary situation in 2024-25, they are likely able to offer a contract that satisfies the former franchise star. Therefore, for teams that want to recruit Harden to contend for a championship, it will be a big gamble. In terms of his current performance, in the past two seasons, Harden has averaged 21 points, 6 rebounds, and 10.7 assists with the 76ers, and 22.5 points, 8 rebounds, and 10.2 assists with the Nets. These numbers have decreased compared to his average of 29.6 points during his time with the Rockets, but his assists have increased (he averaged around 7.7 assists with the Rockets). This is because Harden is no longer the primary ball handler on his current teams, the Nets and the 76ers. He is limited by declining athleticism and the league's crackdown on offensive fouls. These factors have reduced his desire to drive to the basket. Additionally, during his time with the Nets, he played alongside Kevin Durant, a dominant offensive player, and although the three stars rarely played together, Harden mostly served as the team's secondary ball handler, responsible for organizing the offense. This is also the case with the 76ers, who have a versatile offensive lineup with players like Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, Tobias Harris, PJ Tucker, and DeAnthony Melton. These factors make it easier for Harden, whose athleticism is declining, to play his game. The Los Angeles Clippers are currently the team most interested in recruiting Harden. However, in order to acquire him, the Clippers would likely have to give up rotation players like Norman Powell and Marcus Morris, as well as draft picks. Due to previous trades, the Clippers do not have any first-round picks until 2027. Considering this, I believe the 76ers would not be interested in acquiring this package for Harden unless they have no other options. Another possibility is the Houston Rockets, but after signing Fred VanVleet, a championship-winning guard from the Toronto Raptors, in free agency this year, the Rockets already have a backcourt rotation that includes VanVleet, Kevin Porter Jr., Jalen Green, Amen Thompson, and Cam Whitmore. Therefore, I think the most likely outcome is that Harden will stay with his current team next season.
