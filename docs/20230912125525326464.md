  How South Sudan's basketball soul Luol Deng is saving South Sudan with basketball

When Deng's basketball achievements are mentioned, most fans think of his great accomplishments with the Bulls, including two All-Star selections and one Defensive Player of the Year award. Please continue reading to learn how Luol Deng, wearing the jersey of the British team at the 2012 Olympics, dreamed of seeing his homeland, South Sudan, reach the highest level. Although Deng has lived in European and American countries throughout his career, he has never forgotten that his roots lie in South Sudan.

Please continue reading to learn how Deng has been carrying the flag of South Sudan's basketball and giving back to his homeland long before his retirement.

In 2005, Deng established a non-profit organization named after himself, with the goal of providing basketball opportunities for young people and organizing training camps and basketball programs for both genders, expanding from the UK to South Sudan.

Continuing on, for the next two years, Deng served as an ambassador for the NBA's Basketball Without Borders program, assisting in various activities, including helping Lost Boys of Sudan refugees and rebuilding a school in South Sudan that his grandfather had built in 1972.

At the same time, Deng's foundation not only assists in the education, sports, and psychological counseling of people with disabilities but also serves as the main source of funding for the South Sudan men's and women's basketball teams.

"We have built a school in South Sudan, with nearly two thousand students enrolled, and we have provided over 300 scholarships," Deng said.

"Some of them have become doctors or pursued other non-basketball-related professions. Through scholarships and various resources, the young people of South Sudan can grow and develop in all aspects," Deng added. Through the NGO organization "Enough Project," Deng has been dedicated to reducing local conflicts and promoting peace in his home country, playing an important role in this goal. In addition, Deng has promoted the construction of 12 basketball courts and sports changing rooms in South Sudan. In 2008, he was awarded the United Nations Humanitarian Award for his contributions to the development and community building in South Sudan. The ongoing civil war in South Sudan has been the problem Deng wants to solve the most, and he has used basketball as a platform to raise funds, provide aid, and create opportunities. "South Sudan's basketball is undoubtedly something I want to share with everyone," Deng said. "Part of the funds will be donated to the Deng Basketball Academy and help the community, such as bringing in more wheelchairs, allowing doctors to reach more villages for medical treatment, and promoting and advocating for mental health-related issues, which are major concerns in the South Sudanese community."

In 2012, the NBA established NBA Africa, including basketball training academies, facilities, organizing the African league, and promoting social issues such as gender equality and improving the African economy. In addition to Deng, former NBA players Grant Hill, Ian Mahinmi, Dikembe Mutombo, and Joakim Noah are also investors, and former US President Barack Obama is an investor and strategic partner. Deng grew up in South Sudan, and his family has been leaders for generations. His father even served as a government official, including the position of deputy prime minister. When the second civil war broke out in Sudan, Deng's family first fled to Egypt and then sought political asylum in the UK. Deng also had the opportunity to learn from former NBA player Manute Bol during his time in Egypt, which paved the way for his basketball career.

Bol's humanitarian efforts in Sudan were more famous than his ten-year NBA career. He was a member of the Advisory Board of Sudan Sunrise, an organization dedicated to promoting peace in Sudan and establishing 41 schools in South Sudan. Bol founded the Ring True Foundation to raise funds for the reconstruction and assistance of Sudan, and he invested most of his NBA salary into the foundation.

"He is not only a basketball legend in Africa but also an important figure in helping South Sudan gain independence," Deng said. Deng has continued Bol's torch and has been using basketball to aid South Sudan. He built an outdoor basketball court in Juba, South Sudan, named after Bol, where over a thousand children are learning basketball.

Deng made his first visit to South Sudan in 2010, and in 2011, he donated a portion of his salary to help the people who had been displaced due to the civil war and turmoil to return home to vote in the independence referendum. South Sudan officially declared independence in July 2011.

Around the same time, Deng became involved with the South Sudan Basketball Federation and obtained official recognition from FIBA in December 2013.

Despite Deng's resources, South Sudan's basketball resources are still lacking. Apart from the outdoor courts Deng built, there are no comprehensive training facilities. As a result, international games often require teams to arrive early to practice.

"Before joining the British team, Sudan came to recruit me when the country was in the midst of a civil war. I felt it was not suitable at the time and declined, but the idea of representing Sudan has always resonated in my heart," Deng said. After establishing the basketball federation in 2011, Deng has been in contact with many local South Sudanese players with representation qualifications. "Since establishing the federation, I have felt that South Sudanese players cherish this opportunity. They not only get to represent the country in games but also contribute to society and feel the support of the people, improving the country's image," Deng added. Even when he was playing in the NBA, Deng maintained contact with South Sudanese players, arranging training camps and games for them.
