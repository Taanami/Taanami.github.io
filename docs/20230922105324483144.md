They surprised everyone by defeating strong opponents in the district preliminaries and clinching the second place in the central region. The team consists mainly of freshmen and sophomores, who have shown great competitiveness this year. They always give their opponents a tough fight and deliver heavy blows at crucial moments.

Why are they described as the dark horse? In the national tournament, all teams had to overcome the challenge of unfamiliar venues and environments. Despite the difficulties, Xinmin High School remained resilient. Although they did not make it to the top four, they put immense pressure on other teams in the group stage. In their first match against the current national champions, Zhiping High School, they lost by only four points. They also won by a large margin against Jingwen High School and had a close defeat of just six points against Kaohsiung Vocational High School. This shows that they have the ability to compete against strong teams from different regions.

Although Xinmin High School has a majority of freshmen and sophomores, they are mainly supported by the senior players in their third year. Under the guidance of these seniors, the team will become even stronger. The seniors say, "These younger players have more talent and better physical qualities than us. We hope they will work even harder in the future. Their ultimate goal is to help the team secure a spot in the southern district of Taichung, and they also hope to achieve a better ranking in the next Firefighting Cup." One of the key players and team captain, Lin Yuke, plays a crucial role in stabilizing the team's morale. He leads the team to break through difficulties when they are in a slump. His most memorable game was the district preliminaries against Dajia Industrial High School, where the match went into double overtime. Through the team's collective effort, they secured the victory, advanced to the top four, and achieved an impressive second place finish. Lin Yuke was also selected as one of the tournament's best five players. As captain, he has learned to listen and discover the most suitable roles for each team member on the court when there are disagreements or difficulties in implementing tactics. Listening and discovering have been the biggest rewards for Lin Yuke as captain. After graduation, he will pursue his dream and study at the police academy, embarking on the next journey of his life.

The rest of the younger players will continue to strive for improvement, carrying the expectations of their seniors. Whether they can achieve their goals in the league and how far this dark horse can go in the future, is something everyone is eagerly anticipating.
