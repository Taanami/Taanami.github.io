 PLG's Observation on Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions' New Season from FIBA Asia Cup Singapore Exhibition Game

Let's talk about the most concerning aspect of the foreign players' strength on the team. Daniel Ochefu, also known as "Ou Lion Fu," is a typical playmaking center. He serves as the second or third initiator, and is able to hold the ball and observe his teammates' movements while being double-teamed. He is able to make the right pass to the most suitable spot, making him a versatile player who can quickly adapt to any team's system. The only concern is his speed, as he seemed to struggle to keep up with the fast-paced offense of the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions. However, this could be due to his desire to conserve his energy against the shorter Singapore team.

As for his offensive performance, we will have to wait until the official warm-up matches to see if he can contribute to the team's scoring. On the defensive end, he is solid and does not easily fall for fake moves. He carefully observes his opponent's shooting position and tries to disrupt their shot. However, his rebounding skills may need some improvement. 

Taylor Braun is a familiar face, having played for the Taiwan Beer team and the Yulon Luxgen Dinos before joining the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions. He is an all-around player who can play positions 1 to 4, but he is not a dominant foreign player. He is more of a utility player, and his impact on the team may not be as significant as Ochefu and Attinella. With Attinella and Chou Po-hsun currently preparing for the Asian Games, we have yet to see how well they can integrate into the team. Braun's value may only be fully realized during the playoffs, but this also depends on the team's coaching staff being more flexible in their tactics.

Let's move on to discuss the local reinforcements for the team. The most notable addition is Prince Chien-kang, who played for Taiwan Beer last season. In 25 games, he averaged 31.6 minutes per game, 12.5 points, and 3.2 assists. His three-point shooting is his highlight, as he averaged 2.6 three-pointers per game with a 37.6% shooting percentage. As Taiwan Beer's leading scorer last season, he can bring a much-needed three-point threat to the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions. However, he will need the right tactics to fully utilize his shooting skills. Last season, it seemed like the coaching staff did not have a specific strategy for their shooters, and players had to create their own opportunities with their ball-handling skills. Hopefully, with the twin towers on the team, Chien-kang will have more chances to shoot.

Another promising addition is Liu Guang-shang, who was selected in the draft but did not make the final cut. He was picked up by the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions, and we believe this was a smart move. He has a soft shooting touch, stands at 192cm, and is very mobile. In terms of potential, his ceiling and floor are higher than at least 70% of this year's draft picks. Compared to his college days, he has visibly bulked up without sacrificing his speed. This has also improved his ability to control his body after physical contact. While the Singapore team may not have a high-scoring offense, their players have a bigger build compared to the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions. The team should focus on improving their physicality as well. If they only prioritize speed and steals, they will be easily exposed by their opponents without a solid foundation.

Finally, let's talk about the team's defense. FIBA referees are known to be strict, especially when it comes to physicality and collisions between players. This is something that local players need to pay attention to, discuss with their teammates, and communicate with the referees on the court. The referees' perspective may differ from the players', which can lead to confusion and frustration. It's important to understand the referees' criteria to make quick adjustments during the game.
