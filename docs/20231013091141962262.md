PLG Team arrived in Singapore yesterday (22nd) to participate in the 2023 FIBA Continental Cup exhibition game.

In addition to having all coaches and players, PLG Team also brought their home court host, DJ, Muse Girls, and interactive activities to Singapore, hoping to share their professional basketball management experience with the Singapore Sports Council and strengthen their cooperation with Singapore and East Asian basketball in the future.

PLG Team has gained recognition from the high-quality local construction brand "Da Yan Construction" in Hsinchu, and the two have officially joined forces under the name "Hsinchu Da Yan PLG Team" for this exhibition game. This morning, Muse Girls and mascot Ridi led a group of fans to visit historic buildings in Singapore, including the Asian Civilizations Museum, Victoria Theatre, Old Singapore Parliament House, and Merlion Park. They also designed interactive games during the trip to help the fans get to know Muse Girls and Ridi better, hoping to leave unforgettable memories for the fans on this trip to Lion City.

Muse Girls' captain Linlin happily said, "This is my first time traveling with the fans as a cheerleader. I'm glad that through these few days of activities, the fans can support PLG Team even more. I also hope that after this international exchange, Muse Girls can gain more recognition in Asia!" PLG Team played against the Singapore Slingers at the Singapore Indoor Stadium this afternoon. In order to allow local and foreign players to bond through the game, PLG Team sent out Kao Kuo-hao, Wang Zi-gang, Shih Yan-tsung, Bo Lang, and Ou Shi-fu as starters. Right from the start, PLG Team showed their strong determination, and after building a double-digit lead, the bench players, including Zhang Jie-wei, Liu Guang-shang, and Jiang Guang-qian, contributed their firepower with 12, 11, and 10 points respectively. In the end, PLG Team defeated the Singapore Slingers 84-61.

It was Ou Shi-fu's first time representing PLG Team in an open competition. He played for 15 minutes and scored 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 blocks with an 83% shooting percentage. He was voted by the fans as the best player of the game. Ou Shi-fu said, "I'm very happy that I could help the team win in my first game. Although we played in a different city today, having fans from Hsinchu come to watch made me feel like I was playing at home. I believe that in this kind of team atmosphere, I can quickly blend in with the team." When asked about the team's chemistry, head coach Lin Guan-lun said, "Today's main goal was to integrate the team and give more playing time to our young players. Since the foreign players have fewer opportunities to practice with the team, I hope that through games, they can become more familiar with the team. Today was an experiment with our new lineup."
