  According to reporter Jason Dumas, sources revealed that Dwight Howard has completed his two-day interview process with the Warriors.

 The Warriors will make a decision as soon as today on whether or not to sign Howard. Veteran players on the Warriors have informally agreed to the team signing Howard, who will now travel to Los Angeles to train with Chris Paul and Draymond Green.

 The Warriors' lack of depth in the paint has been a weakness for the team, and adding Howard would alleviate some of the pressure on Looney and Green on both ends of the court. Afterwards, Green retweeted the news and commented, "Someday, someday, nothing will be leaked. Someday. By the way, Jason, you're good. But someday, nothing will be leaked. I have a dream." Green's comment has a reason behind it, as the rumors and video of him punching Poole were leaked by an internal source. The Warriors even investigated their internal confidentiality as a result, with Steve Kerr particularly hating when the media knows the starting lineup before the game.
