The Chinese women's 3x3 basketball team dominated against India in the quarterfinals of the 2023 Asian Games, winning by a score of 21-10. Led by players from UBA Taiwan, such as Chen Yu-jie from Taipei Normal University, Huang Chiao-chun and Guo Hong-ting from Chinese Culture University, and Xu Shi-han from WSBL, the team has now advanced to the semifinals after securing four consecutive wins.

In the previous Asian Games, the Chinese women's team made it to the bronze medal match but narrowly lost by one point to Thailand, missing out on a medal. This year, they have continued their strong performance, defeating Japan, Kazakhstan, and Nepal in the preliminary rounds and finishing at the top of their group. In the quarterfinals, they faced a strong Indian team, but were able to maintain a lead throughout the game, with Xu Shi-han's 2-point shot giving them a 9-8 lead early on. A 6-point run extended their lead and they were able to prevent India from scoring for the last five minutes of the game, ultimately winning by 21 points.

Chen Yu-jie scored 8 points and had 6 rebounds, while Xu Shi-han contributed 7 points, Guo Hong-ting had 4 points, and Huang Chiao-chun had 2 points and 4 rebounds. The Chinese team will now face their next opponent in the semifinals.
