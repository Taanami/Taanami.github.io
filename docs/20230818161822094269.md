 The most talented basketball player, Dwight Howard, would have been a spiritual master if he didn't play basketball.

Recently, the news of former NBA star Dwight Howard joining the T1 Taoyuan Yung Fu Clouded Leopards professional basketball team in Taiwan has become a hot topic in the sports world.

This star, who has been selected to the NBA All-Star Game eight times, has a fierce competitiveness on the court that seems like he wants to devour his opponents. However, in private, he has a side that most people don't know about. First of all, he is very fond of "fragrance." For example, he has four perfumes that he is very fond of, such as "Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Crystal Flame," "Maison Francis Kurkdjian OUD," "Louis Vuitton L'IMMENSITE," and "Louis Vuitton Les Sables Roses." Among them, "Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Crystal Flame" has floral, amber, and woody notes, bringing out the mineral fragrance of ambergris with floral scents like jasmine and saffron, as well as woody and red cedar spicy scents. On the other hand, "Maison Francis Kurkdjian OUD" showcases sweet saffron, labdanum, Moroccan cedar, sweet vanilla, and musk in the top notes, while the base notes are dominated by Laotian agarwood and Indonesian patchouli.

In addition, there is also "Louis Vuitton L'IMMENSITE," which is a blend of grapefruit, ginger, rock rose, and a moderate amount of amber fragrance, as well as "Louis Vuitton Les Sables Roses," which combines rose with agarwood from Baghdad and has spices, leather, and animalistic scents. These are the perfumes that Howard loves.

Furthermore, Howard is also very fond of scented candles. Whether at home, on the road, or even when watching movies, he always brings scented candles with him. Another item that Howard likes to carry with him at all times is "sage." He has different types of sage, such as rosemary sage, blood sage, and wheel sage. Every time he returns home or enters the team's locker room, he smokes sage to purify himself.

In the past, Dwight Howard (@dwighthoward) used to bring sage and smoke the entire court and every teammate before every game in the NBA.

For Howard, this practice allows his mind to find peace and gain energy on the court. Apart from sage, there are also other objects that bring peace to Howard's mind, such as the Bible, quartz, and singing bowls, which open his mind.

In addition to the above, he has many different habits and interests. For example, he loves chewing gum and mala beads, which freshen his breath. He also has as many as 20 to 30 speakers at home, and he always brings a speaker to the court to play music during practice. His teammates even call him "Radio Raheem" or "MC Tight Sound."

It is worth mentioning that this former NBA star is just like you and me, a fan who loves watching TV shows and movies. His favorite TV show is "Game of Thrones," and he has watched each season at least 10 times. However, no matter how much he loves it, he also feels dumbfounded and disappointed with the ending. If you are curious about this basketball superstar who has the most fame in Taiwanese basketball history, you can follow Howard on his social media accounts. After previously live-streaming and sharing various local snacks he tasted in Taiwan, he will surely show his unique side on the court again.
