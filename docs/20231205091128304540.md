 ItsAllAbout18 continues on the road of saying goodbye to Ainge and belongs to the team-building philosophy of Brad Stevens.

As we bid farewell to Robert Williams, many Celtics fans may feel emotional, but we cannot help but admire Stevens' trading skills. This article will not focus on the team's performance, but rather take a look back at the team-building philosophy that Stevens has demonstrated from being a coach to a general manager. Please continue reading below.

1. No such thing as a traditional "ball-handling" role Since Stevens took over as head coach, except for Rajon Rondo, the team has had no traditional ball-handlers.

From Isaiah Thomas, Kyrie Irving, Terry Rozier to Kemba Walker, they are all offensive-minded guards. Of course, this may be a result of the changing environment and the evolution of player abilities. However, Stevens' Motion Offense philosophy puts more emphasis on quality screening and players' ability to read and react, so we can see different players initiating tactics in the half-court offense. Please continue reading below.

Moreover, this influence also appears in transition attacks. In games under Stevens' coaching, we can see big men or wings quickly passing or pushing the ball after grabbing rebounds. If there is no chance for a fast break, they will quickly pass the ball to the primary ball-handler and set screens to create a second opportunity for early offense.

One of the early offensive tactics Stevens likes to use.

2. Shooting is secondary, high-quality screening and playmaking big men are key

Celtics fans may mistakenly think that under Stevens' recent management, he loves stretch-shooting big men. Of course, Kelly Olynyk also became a stretch-four in his system, but in reality, even in the small-ball era, Stevens still puts on the court big men with no outside shooting ability, such as Amir Johnson, Aron Baynes, Tristan Thompson, and Enes Kanter (Freedom). Apart from height and rebounding, he values their screening abilities.

Among them, Al Horford and Daniel Theis are undoubtedly Stevens' favorites.

These two players not only provide high-quality screening, but also have good passing abilities from the high post. They can also execute pick-and-pop plays or be ready on the perimeter to open up space for the offense. After Stevens became the GM, he brought these two big men back to Boston, showing his love for them.

3. "Swiss Army knife" wings are never too many

In Stevens' system, the role of a swingman is clear and simple. As long as they can defend or shoot threes, they can definitely earn playing time and serve as a reliable role player.

From Jae Crowder, Jonas Jerebko to Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford.

Although some of these players' potentials were not fully developed, they still shone in Stevens' system compared to the undersized guards drafted by Ainge. After reading the three points above, we should have some understanding of Stevens' management and team-building philosophy.

Next, let's take a look back at some key moves he made in the past two seasons. (Ignoring salary structure, injury exceptions, etc., and only looking at player transactions) ※Bold→stretch big man; underline→swingman; italic→guard

We can see that Stevens' team-building strategy is not much different from his preferred player lineup during his coaching tenure. Whether it's a ball-handling guard, high-quality screening big men, versatile wings, or having depth in key positions, these are all part of his philosophy in building a team.

After Ainge's departure, Stevens' team-building philosophy continues to evolve, and we can't wait to see his next move as a general manager.
