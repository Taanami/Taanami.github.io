  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Dončić, the Rising Stars in International Competition

Sharp as a weapon, swift as the wind. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is comparable to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Dončić, the rising stars in international competition. Let's discuss and share various views on the game. The score of the quarterfinals of the 2023 FIBA World Cup between Canada and Slovenia was 100:89. Canada, which has made remarkable progress in the world basketball arena in recent years, won the game and made it to the top four for the first time in their history, crushing Slovenia's dream of reaching the top four.

The biggest pre-game focus and post-game topic undoubtedly revolved around the world's number one star, Luka Dončić. Before the game, there was speculation about whether Dončić, who was expected to be a candidate for NBA MVP in the new season, could dominate and lead a strong Slovenian team to achieve their best international performance. The question was whether they could advance towards the championship and achieve personal milestones in the highly competitive World Cup. However, the post-game focus shifted to Dončić being ejected from the crucial battle due to two technical fouls.

Dončić revealed after the game that a referee had told the Slovenian players that he would not give him the calls he wanted because of his disrespect towards the referees. This was evident in most situations during the game, as Dončić created collisions with the ball, but the referees did not blow the whistle. This was followed by Dončić's various expressions of dissatisfaction towards the referees, but his efforts to earn the calls were in vain.

To be honest, in this quarterfinals game, it was clear that Canada had a slight advantage in terms of the calls. Dončić may have had reasons to complain, but he paid the price by receiving technical fouls for his complaints. Although the team fought hard and the final point difference was only four points when Dončić was ejected, his absence in the second half of the game hindered Slovenia's comeback.

Dončić could be considered a double loser, but Canada's star player, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, was a double winner. He had an outstanding individual performance, and Canada achieved victory and advanced, creating a new milestone in their team's history. The meeting between the two players in this international competition, with one rising and the other falling, was something rarely anticipated.

Regarding Dončić, he first came into the spotlight during the 2017 EuroBasket when Slovenia unexpectedly won the championship. At that time, the team's point guard, Goran Dragić, won the tournament MVP, but the 18-year-old Dončić had already shown his ability to take on the responsibility of a key player. People noticed that, similar to Ricky Rubio from Spain in the past, a young basketball prodigy who attracted everyone's attention had emerged from Europe. From that EuroBasket tournament onwards, Dončić, as a basketball prodigy, quickly rose to prominence on the world stage. He received significant attention during the 2018 NBA Draft and could have challenged for the top pick if it weren't for Deandre Ayton's perfect fit for the Phoenix Suns, regardless of position or background. Dončić ultimately became the third pick in the draft and joined the Dallas Mavericks through a trade. Since then, no one has been able to stop Dončić from shining on various basketball courts. In his rookie year in the NBA, he averaged 21.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 6.0 assists, and his numbers have only improved throughout his five-year career. This season, he has reached the level of "30-8-8," which is truly remarkable. In terms of the world stage, Dončić has undoubtedly inherited the baton from Dragić and has become the absolute core of Slovenia's self-built system. In this year's World Cup, with the absence of Nikola Jokić from Serbia, Gianis Antetokounmpo from Greece, and other top American players, Dončić posted impressive stats of 26.3 points (the highest in the tournament), 6.8 rebounds, and 6.5 assists, living up to his reputation as the top star of the tournament.

Speaking of his performance, there is no doubt about Dončić's skills and the "wunderkind" label that has been attached to him since his early years. The problem lies in the increasing number of instances where Dončić has been seen arguing with referees, possibly due to tasting success in the NBA. In the past three seasons, Dončić has consistently ranked in the top three in technical fouls in the league, exceeding the threshold of 16 technical fouls that would result in a suspension. In this World Cup quarterfinals game, he was ejected due to two technical fouls. Not only did Dončić express his dissatisfaction with gestures, but he even made a money-counting gesture towards the referees, implying that they were being bribed and unfair. Although the referees' officiating may not have been ideal, Dončić's actions were unacceptable and could be considered a stain on his reputation.

Of course, objectively speaking, Slovenia may not have been the most favored team to win the championship. The only reason they received some expectations was because of Dončić. Having such a superstar raises hopes for him to create miracles. However, miracles did not happen this time, and Slovenia failed to make it to the top four. Looking at the results, it may not necessarily be considered a disappointment, but the way Dončić swallowed defeat along with his ejection from the game is reminiscent of the 2021 NBA playoffs, where MVP Jokić was ejected from a game and watched his team get swept while trailing 0-3.
