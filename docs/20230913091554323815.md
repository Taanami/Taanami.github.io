  Coexistence of Pressure in the 2023 World Cup and Reflections of Steve Kerr

August 24th holds great significance for the head coach of the USA basketball team, Steve Kerr.

This day is not only important for the USA team because it marks the first game of the 2023 FIBA World Cup, but also because it is associated with Kobe Bryant, who wore the jersey number 24 throughout his 20-year NBA career. Please continue reading to learn more.

During the official press conference before the opening game against New Zealand on August 26th, both Steve Kerr and Jalen Brunson were interviewed about their first impressions of the Philippines and the challenges they are about to face. However, for Kerr personally, August 24th holds a special significance.

"August 24th is my mother's birthday, and that's what stands out to me the most about this day," Kerr replied with a smile when asked about his memories of Kobe Bryant.

He humorously added, "Happy birthday, Mom, but I'm sure she's not watching right now." Reflecting on his memories of Kobe, Kerr said, "I had the opportunity to play against him as a player, and after I started coaching in the later stages of Kobe's career, I have cherished memories with him. It was a great privilege to be on the same court as one of the greatest players in NBA history. We still remember Kobe and what he meant to all of us and the entire league."

The USA team is currently competing in the FIBA World Cup, with the mission of reclaiming the world championship title after finishing in 7th place in 2019, which was the second-worst result in the history of the USA team.

However, after losing to Lithuania and Germany in the quarterfinals, it is confirmed that the USA team will not win the gold medal this time.

Kerr praised the team, saying, "That experience really determined how we selected this team. We wanted players who we believed could come together as a team in a short period of time."

"We have a great group of players who are connected to each other, can pass the ball, and enjoy this experience," he added.

Kerr also admitted that his team learned valuable lessons in the early stages. The USA team won all five warm-up games against Puerto Rico (117-74), Slovenia (92-62), Spain (98-88), Greece (108-86), and Germany (99-91).

"The most important thing is to be familiar with FIBA rules and to be united. Throughout this process, we faced strong opponents, and while we have confidence, we also faced some setbacks. Spain and Germany presented challenges, and these experiences have helped us because we know how talented these teams are," Kerr praised the German and Spanish teams that pushed them to their limits during the warm-up games.

For the USA team, anything other than a gold medal is considered a failure, but the team's point guard, Jalen Brunson, does not shy away from the challenge.

"For me personally, there is no such thing as 'pressure'," the New York Knicks star responded when asked about pressure. "I understand that as long as I give my best in my game, there is no such thing as pressure. There are moments and situations that require facing tough odds, but my confidence comes from my professional ethics. As long as I continue to work hard and understand that I strive for improvement every day, there is no pressure. I think for the team, in such moments, we rely heavily on each other," Brunson analyzed.

Kerr, who won the gold medal in the FIBA World Cup in 1986, also talked about the weight of responsibility. Kerr explained, "Pressure is self-imposed. We all love what we do, and I love coaching. I also love pressure or what we call competition. Being a competitor means accepting the possibility of defeat. That's the essence of the game, there are wins and losses." He also added, "Effort, approach, and chemistry are key. I love being part of a team, I love what we are doing right now, trying to build something and putting something on the line. Of course, the charm of sports is that there is no risk to our lives. However, we compete, we give our all, we strive to win honors, and we know that failure may come with criticism, and we are okay with that." Kerr concluded, "But our mindset is that this is an incredibly enjoyable thing. We are extremely fortunate to be a part of all this, to compete, and when we look back on all this in our lives, we know that we gave it our all. Like I said, we are working hard, and we want to win, but whatever happens, happens, and we accept it. That's part of the game."
