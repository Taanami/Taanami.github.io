  Portland Arms Dealer Discusses Three-Team Trade for Lillard

Bucks Part: The Bucks send Jrue Holiday, Grayson Allen, Bucks' 2029 first-round pick, and the 2028 and 2030 pick swap rights. In return, they acquire Damian Lillard. It's surprising that Damian Lillard's final destination turned out to be the Bucks. Why didn't I consider the Bucks in my list? It's not only because Holiday is irreplaceable, but also because they didn't have enough draft assets to trade for Lillard. Upgrading the backcourt commander to a Tier-0 guard scorer with just Holiday, a first-round pick, and two pick swap rights is definitely a steal.

Although it's not entirely a downside, Holiday focuses too much on defense, resulting in his inconsistent offense in the playoffs. Especially since Giannis expressed the desire for the team to strengthen and Holiday mentioned that he would retire after his contract expires, it's understandable that the Bucks would have their eyes on him.

What's even more important is that the Bucks have never had a backcourt scorer who requires so much ball possession since Giannis joined the team. Lopez, Giannis, and Middleton don't need much ball possession, especially with MVP Giannis being able to play off the ball. Although it's not possible for Lillard to play the same way he did with the Trail Blazers, where he had complete control, it should be a role that Lillard can adapt to, being the pick-and-roll ball handler with a reduced self-shot ratio.

Do you still need to play every possession like you did with Nurkic as your pick-and-roll partner when you have Giannis? So, here's the question, how will the team compensate for the loss of Grayson Allen and Jrue Holiday's perimeter defense? Honestly, it's not necessary. The Bucks have always had issues with inconsistent offense from their guards. As mentioned earlier, Holiday's problem has been discussed, and Carter, Allen, and Connaughton are all guards who prioritize defense but have inconsistent offense. The Bucks seem to be willing to sacrifice some perimeter defense in exchange for a more stable backcourt initiator.

Especially since their defensive advantage has always been in the interior, as long as the guards can provide screens and block the first shot opportunity, allowing Giannis to help defend with his mobility and Lopez to clean up the paint, it will suffice.

The Bucks have reduced their opponents' paint field goal percentage by 2.8% this year, thanks to their interior protectors. Although the responsibility of guarding star players has always been given to Holiday, it may be difficult to find someone to take on that role in the future, especially with Middleton getting older and Crowder not being a suitable option. It might really be Lillard or Connaughton, but it must be said that Lillard had a defensive presence at the beginning of the season, and his poor statistics were largely due to the team's overall defensive struggles. However, if they use a 3-2 defensive formation, positioning Lillard as a chaser with low activity, I believe Lillard won't become a black hole within the team.

I was initially going to criticize the Bucks' offseason upgrades as being inadequate, but now with Lillard suddenly appearing, it seems like I need to reconsider.

- Trail Blazers Part: The Trail Blazers send Damian Lillard, Jusuf Nurkic, Nassir Little, and Keon Johnson. In return, they acquire Jrue Holiday, Deandre Ayton, Toumani Camara, Bucks' 2029 first-round pick, and the 2028 and 2030 pick swap rights.

Let's start with the trade rumors surrounding the Heat, which were the most intense. Faced with Lillard's desire to go to the Heat, the Trail Blazers obviously didn't comply and couldn't find a favorable trade package from the Heat, such as Herro, Lowry, and Robinson in a 3-for-2 deal, along with two first-round picks. It's no wonder the Trail Blazers had no interest in negotiating with the Heat.

But sending him to the Bucks also satisfies Giannis, who clearly likes Lillard. After all, during this year's All-Star draft, Giannis skipped Holiday and chose Lillard as his first pick. Now, he's doing the same thing again.

I never thought that Lillard, Nurkic, Little, and Keon could bring in so many assets. One first-round pick, two pick swap rights, this year's All-Star Holiday, and the first overall pick center Ayton. It looks quite substantial on paper.

Especially with Holiday having only a remaining 1+1 contract and a salary of 36 million that's not too difficult to match, the trade value is still high. The Trail Blazers should act as arms dealers, taking advantage of other teams' desire to strengthen while the Bucks trade for Lillard and acquire more assets.

For example, we can sell Lillard to the Bucks and then tell everyone, "The East is dangerous now, do any of you need Jrue Holiday to guard Lillard?" and deceive them of their assets. As long as the next team for Holiday can offer an expiring contract and enough first-round picks, I believe the Trail Blazers would consider it.

Of course, the combined 90 million contract of Simons, Grant, and Ayton for at least three more years is not something the Trail Blazers would consider swallowing.

But if they can acquire young wing potential, I believe the Trail Blazers would still consider it. As for Ayton, sigh. Personally, I'm not a big fan of him, even though his overall potential is undoubtedly higher than the already established Nurkic. But Ayton's excellent interior defense is already the Trail Blazers' best reinforcement.

Although they would lose the threat of the pick-and-pop and handoffs, if Billups plans to completely reshape the offensive and defensive system, reduce double-teaming, increase pick-and-roll and low-post frequency, the Henderson-Ayton connection can still be a threat in the future.
