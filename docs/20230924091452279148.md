 NBA Powerhouse Victor Wembanyama Commits to Representing France in Olympics

French player Victor Wembanyama recently confirmed in an interview that he will participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Wembanyama stated, "Achieving success in the Olympics would be a great story, with the goal being nothing less than a gold medal. I will compete in the Olympics." He also mentioned watching this year's World Cup, expressing disappointment in the results for the French team. However, he remains unfazed and refrains from making any judgments. He explains that he was not part of the team at the time, and the team was in the hands of top players. Nevertheless, he believes that the World Cup loss will not affect their chances of achieving something significant in Paris next year.

To maintain his physical condition, Wembanyama chose to skip the recently concluded 2023 FIBA World Cup, which seems to be a wise decision considering his NBA debut. Last November, Wembanyama made his debut for the French national team during the FIBA World Cup European qualifiers. He played four games, averaging 19.0 points and 8.3 rebounds per game.
