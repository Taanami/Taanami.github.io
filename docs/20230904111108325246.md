 Jaylen Brown will participate in the Big3 league, founded by Ice Cube, and he is my hero. The Big3 league will hold its All-Star Game and Championship Finals in London tomorrow, and Boston Celtics player Jaylen Brown will be playing in the All-Star Game, becoming the first active NBA player to participate in the Big3 league.

Ice Cube, the founder of the Big3 league, announced this on Twitter: "Jaylen Brown is my hero, and he will be the first active NBA player to participate in the Big3 competition. This is a great statement. He is working hard to help the league succeed, preparing for tomorrow's All-Star Game. Celebrate with fireworks, forever grateful." According to the official website, Jaylen Brown will provide assistance to a local charity organization called the "London Youth Team," which aims to support and improve the lives of young people in London through community organization networks. BIG3 will donate to this organization together with Jaylen Brown, further raising awareness of the "Bridge Program." Jaylen Brown's "Bridge Program" is a learning and leadership program designed to help young people from marginalized communities become the next generation of leaders.
