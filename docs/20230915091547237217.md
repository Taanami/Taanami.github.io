  NBA pitcher Michael Porter Jr. unexpectedly embraced by a fan during opening pitch at CPBL game

September 9, 2023, 18:25 - In a charity event in Taiwan, Michael Porter Jr., former forward for the NBA's Denver Nuggets, was invited to throw the opening pitch at a game for the Chinatrust Brothers. However, an unexpected incident occurred when a fan rushed onto the field and embraced Porter. Despite the intrusion, Porter remained friendly and shook hands with the fan. The fan was subsequently apprehended by staff, while Porter shouted, "Run, my boy!"

Porter's visit to Taiwan included a series of charity activities, with the highlight being the opening pitch for the Chinatrust Brothers. Although the game was delayed due to rain, Porter still took the opportunity to throw the first pitch. However, just before the pitch, a fan made a sudden and surprising move.

During an interview with the host, a man in a white shirt abruptly entered the field and tightly embraced Porter with open arms. The host and translator quickly pushed the man away, but Porter maintained a smile and shook hands with the fan in response. The man in the white shirt managed to escape the control of the staff and ran around the field. Seeing this, Porter laughed and said, "Run, my boy, run!" Finally, the fan's intrusion came to an end, and Porter continued the interview, expressing his happiness to be there and his excitement about throwing the first pitch. He jokingly warned the audience to be careful, as he expected the pitch to be fast. Porter also learned some techniques from the Brothers' pitching coach, Edison, before the game, hoping to showcase them to the fans. However, due to an incorrect angle, the ball bounced and landed prematurely in the hands of the catcher, Zhou Siqi.
