In today's mid-season showdown between the Cavaliers and the 76ers, the game was only decided in overtime. Led by Darius Garland's 32 points, 8 assists, and 5 rebounds, the Cavaliers were able to come back in the final moments and defeat the 76ers 122-119. Donovan Mitchell is still out due to injury, but the Cavaliers showed their strong offensive firepower in today's game, taking a 27-23 lead in the first quarter and extending it to 65-53 by halftime. The Cavaliers maintained their lead throughout the second half, but the 76ers fought back in the fourth quarter with consecutive points from Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid to tie the game. In the final moments, Patrick Beverley's jump shot put the 76ers in the lead.

However, the Cavaliers tied the game with two free throws from Darius Garland after a foul, and the 76ers called for a timeout. After the timeout, Joel Embiid missed a jump shot while being defended by Jarrett Allen, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, Jarrett Allen scored two points, and Tyrese Maxey quickly cut in with his speed to tie the game again. The two teams continued to go back and forth, with Tobias Harris hitting a three-pointer from the corner to give the 76ers a one-point lead. However, Garland found Allen, who made a hook shot to give the Cavaliers the lead once again in the final moments.

Embiid missed the game-winning shot, and the 76ers had to resort to using their fouls, which resulted in Embiid fouling out of the game.

In the end, Garland made two free throws to extend the Cavaliers' lead to three points, and the 76ers' final shot was intercepted by Dean Wade.
