  How Baron Davis Transformed from a Crazy Guard on the Court to a Top Venture Capitalist in the NBA

 Simon Baron Davis had a spectacular career on the court, making two All-Star appearances and winning two steals titles. After retiring in 2017, he became a commentator for NBA games on TNT. However, Davis is not just a basketball player, he is also a low-key top entrepreneur.

 During his playing career, Davis signed six contracts and earned a total salary of approximately $147 million. However, he did not rely solely on his salary to make money. Davis is currently the founder of multiple companies spanning various industries.

 From sports content platform Sports Lifestyle in Culture (SLiC) to multimedia company UWish, Davis has his hand in many different ventures.

 In 2020, when the Taiwan Professional Basketball League, P. LEAGUE+, was established, CEO Chen Chien-chou publicly announced that Baron Davis became a shareholder through the introduction of Silicon Valley Taiwan Help, led by New Taipei City Kings CEO Chen Hsin-sheng.

 Davis is also a shareholder in the East Asia Super League, which is set to launch a new home and away game format in 2023 and is focused on using content and videos to expand the influence of basketball in Asia.

 Davis is a representative of players who invest early and enjoy the benefits early. What's more important is that he brings his precise vision from the court into the business world. His first investment was in Vitaminwater. In 2007, Coca-Cola announced that it would acquire Vitaminwater for $4.1 billion, and Davis received a substantial return on his investment. In 2014, Davis became an angel investor for online membership-based retailer Thrive Market, which saw a surge in performance during the pandemic, once again showcasing Davis' successful investment acumen.

 In 2016, Davis participated in the Series A investment of flower delivery company Bloomthat, which was valued far beyond the initial evaluation. Due to his accurate vision and diligent research, Davis mainly focuses on early-stage investments. His investment selection criteria not only include potential profitability, but also a positive impact on society and minority entrepreneurship.

 For example, in 2021, he invested in the women's medical cannabis care brand House of Wise. "I like investing in startups because these companies have the potential to become the next generation of social change agents, moving us towards a better future," Davis said. "I use investing as a way to be a change agent and help these companies have a greater impact."

 "I have experienced all kinds of teams during my playing career - strong teams, weak opponents, being upset, and being a dark horse that defeats strong teams - so I understand the ups and downs," Davis said. "Now, as a serial entrepreneur, I understand the passion, energy, and determination needed for startups, and I am also willing to take risks and discuss different situations and ways to cope with pressure with these entrepreneurs. My advantage is being bold and detail-oriented."

 Although Davis' talent as a player was not considered top-notch, he has a knack for investing and managing wealth. At the age of 43, Davis can be considered a pioneer in player entrepreneurship. His salary and endorsements during his playing career were not lucrative, but he used his research, investments, and entrepreneurship to forge a new path.

 Davis may be one of the few retired players who are even busier after retirement, with a busy schedule and budget every season. "I usually research 25-30 companies per season and invest in five of them," Davis said. One of the venture capital firms he owns, Business Inside The Game, mainly invests in minority groups such as Black, women, Middle Eastern or Indian, and LGBTQ+. "I want to empower them and use investment to amplify the ideas and wills of these minority groups for the majority to understand and benefit from each other's cultures," he said. He also founded content branding company Black Santa, creating cross-cultural animated characters and launching exclusive content and merchandise to achieve both profit and public welfare goals. "I want to bring stories of heroes and cartoon characters to African Americans and all ethnic groups, so that people of all skin colors can identify, unite, and entertain each other."

 However, in addition to investments with a public welfare purpose, Davis is also involved in major business mergers and transactions. In 2020, when Adidas expressed its intention to sell Reebok, Davis and a group of investors led by rapper Master P made a bid.

 In addition to some mature business models, Davis is also very willing to try new and high-risk investments, such as the Metaverse, Web 3.0, cryptocurrency blockchain games, and NFT. Black Santa released a charity NFT during Christmas in 2021, which sold out in just 14 minutes. "When faced with this new technology and field, don't be overwhelmed, but try to understand and participate. Technology is just a tool, how to use it is the key," Davis said. He believes that Web 3.0 and cryptocurrency are very suitable for professional athletes with a voice and influence, and for creative people who don't like commercialization. "This is a new opportunity, and everyone has the chance to participate." In recent years, Davis has been involved in Web 3.0-related content platforms such as Overtime and Fireside. Davis believes that NBA players themselves have a voice and influence, and with their star power, they can create their own brands and earn wealth and fame like other influencers. However, he does not like to do so. "I like to help and give back, that is the true value for me," Davis said. Former NBA player Brandon Jennings has called Davis the godfather of Los Angeles basketball. "Besides being a great player, he often comes back to the streets to take care of us. He has always been giving back, especially to his hometown. You can call BD anytime, he will definitely answer the phone." Davis' investment enlightenment came from wanting to break away from the exploitation of the professional player industry. "I feel like I have to be 'robbed'. When I was a rookie, I had no idea, so I needed agents and business managers to assist me. But after my three-year contract was over, I decided to do it myself." Davis not only broke the mold by not hiring an agent, but also started thinking about how to invest in himself. He decided to negotiate contracts and build a team to handle commercial activities. "I'm not afraid to go against tradition, I'm very willing to try new things and break the status quo."
