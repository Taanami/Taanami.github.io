 The Chinese White team secured a victory in the fourth quarter of the Jones Cup and finished the tournament in sixth place. 

In the last day of the Jones Cup, the Chinese White team faced Iran in the second-to-last game. The Chinese White team's last win was on Sunday's game, so their goal today was to end the tournament with a victory and leave a good impression. The Chinese White team carried on the good momentum from their previous game against South Korea, performing better on both offense and defense than in previous matches. They took a 12-6 lead, with Ma Jianhao, Chen Fanboyuan, and Hong Kaijie scoring from the perimeter. The first quarter ended with the Chinese White team leading 25-15.

In the second quarter, the White team maintained their lead with two fast-break layups and a three-pointer from Hong Kaijie. Iran's offense woke up in this quarter, repeatedly scoring from the outside. The White team called two timeouts to regroup and temporarily held an 8-point lead at halftime.

In the second half, the He brothers continued to contribute points with their shooting, but Iran still put significant pressure on the White team, patiently handling each possession. Ma Jianhao ignited the crowd's emotions with a fast break dunk with just over 3 minutes remaining, but Iran managed to close the gap. The teams entered the final quarter with a 3-point difference. 

At the start of the last quarter, He Dan immediately hit two consecutive three-pointers, and He Bo's fast break dunk broke the deadlock for the game. Ma Jianhao then made another three-pointer, giving the White team a 6-point lead with just under 2 minutes remaining. 

In a crucial moment with 1 minute and 29 seconds left, Ma Jianhao made a fadeaway shot, and Bai Yaocheng made a left-handed layup to score, increasing the lead to 8 points. However, Iran managed to score three-pointers and draw fouls to narrow the gap to 2 points. Then, a turnover occurred during the inbound pass. Fortunately, after Iran's timeout, the White team successfully defended against Iran's offense. Chen Fanboyuan made two free throws after being fouled, and Iran missed their shot again. The game ended with a 91-86 victory for the White team, finally breaking their five-game losing streak. In this tournament, they had 3 wins and 5 losses.

He Bo scored the highest total of 18 points in the game, with He Dan and Ma Jianhao both contributing 14 points. Chen Fanboyuan scored 13 points, and Ban Ba added 10 points to the team's tally.
