 Introduction to Teams Participating in Changyao Cup International Division

The Skills Factory (TSF), located in Atlanta, Georgia, is one of the most highly anticipated teams in this year's Changyao Cup International Division. Founded in 2011, TSF's goal is to train and develop the potential of athletes through age-specific, systematic skill training, personal physical development, and self-organized competitions. Many NBA stars, including James Harden, Trae Young, and Kemba Walker, have trained at TSF during the off-season to prepare for the upcoming season.

TSF offers five levels of training programs, ranging from Introductory Level to Professional Level, tailored to the individual needs and goals of each student. With a focus on developing individual potential, TSF has successfully placed over 200 students in top high schools and universities in the United States, with over 100 students advancing to the NCAA Division I level.

Some notable alumni of TSF include Isaiah Collier (USC), Cam Kraft (Xavier), Aguek Arop (SDSU), first Taiwanese player to receive a full scholarship from a Division I school Che Yu-Cheng (USF), and Filipino rising star Kai Sotto. TSF has established itself as a premier destination for young basketball players from around the world, serving as a launching pad for their dreams of playing in the US.

In addition to hosting their own tournaments, TSF also travels overseas to compete against other countries. This year, they will be making their first trip to Taiwan and are excited for the opportunity to exchange experiences with local players.

The team roster for TSF's first appearance at the Changyao Cup includes top players from different states in the US, such as Julian Whitsey, Juvon Gumory, Ej Smith, and Jeremiah Wilkinson. Their participation is sure to attract a lot of attention to the tournament and bring a new level of competition to Taiwan's basketball scene.

Other teams participating in the Changyao Cup International Division include Manila Yatthai University High School (Philippines), Fukushima Commercial High School (Japan), Sakuragaoka High School (Japan), and Pohang Commercial High School (South Korea).
