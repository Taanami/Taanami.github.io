A few weeks ago in the group stage of the FIBA World Cup, Serbian player Borisa Simanic lost one of his kidneys due to an elbow strike and complications with the local medical environment. Recently, he returned to his home country for an interview, talking about the situation at the time and his current recovery.

First, he mentioned the process of dealing with the injury at the time, saying, "Although everything seemed to be going well at first, there were serious complications and I had to have one kidney removed. It felt strange at first, but my condition is getting better and I can start walking and eating. I hope to recover quickly."

In fact, Simanic's injury was not minor. He had to undergo two surgeries to have his kidney removed, and the complications persisted because his remaining kidney was not functioning properly, according to the doctors. Recalling the situation at the time, Simanic said, "After the two surgeries, there were five days where I had no idea what was happening in the outside world, I didn't even have my phone. When I finally got my phone back after the first surgery, I sent a message to the team to boost their morale, and their victory meant a lot to me. In this regard, we support each other. During the rest of the games, I could only follow them through my phone."

The report also revealed his current condition, with Simanic stating that he has to rest for three months without doing anything, and he won't know his future until at least December. "This time is for my kidney to rest and heal. After this period, I'll have further tests and we'll know if I can continue playing," he said.

Finally, Simanic expressed his gratitude to the fans and his team, saying, "I want to thank everyone who has cared about me, especially my team. I wouldn't have been this strong without their support. I also want to thank all the fans who support the Serbian national team. Your support means a lot to me. I will do everything I can to recover and hope to return to the court as soon as possible."
