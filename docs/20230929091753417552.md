 Who is Mizuno Wave Rider 27 or 26? 

When someone asks, "I want to start running, does Mizuno have recommended shoes?" I just started running and my goal is to finish a full marathon, which Mizuno shoes are more suitable? I have started following a training plan seriously, are there any recommended Mizuno running shoes for daily training? The answer to all these questions is most likely Mizuno Wave Rider. As Mizuno's most classic and evergreen running shoe, the Wave Rider series has always maintained a stable focus on functionality, creating shoes that are suitable for entry-level runners or daily training. It performs well in cushioning, stability, durability, and comfort. Although it may not have the flagship specifications in terms of weight, flexibility, and other aspects, it is definitely a series of shoes that you don't have to worry about stepping on a landmine.

You don't have to worry about the kind of shoes that you are used to wearing. What if they are discontinued? The Wave Rider series is the kind of series that you can continue wearing.

If your Wave Rider 25 is worn out and you can't find it anymore, you can seamlessly transition to the 26th or 27th version. They are both good choices that you can adapt to without any discomfort. This has also become one of the biggest features of the Wave Rider series. Although there may not be significant updates between generations, they all have a relatively stable functional output. This directly leads to today's conclusion: comparing the differences between the two siblings, Rider 26 VS 27. The two shoes have about 90% similarity in terms of functionality. Choose the pair you like based on the color (continue reading for Mizuno Wave Rider 27 configuration: floral breathable mesh upper, dual-layer Mizuno Enerzy cushioning midsole, Wave Plate stability wave board embedded in the midsole, Smooth Ride flex grooves, X10 durable rubber outsole, heel drop: 12mm (26.5mm in the front, 28.5mm in the back), weight: approximately 270g for US men's size 9 (295g for SSW version). Mizuno Wave Rider 26 difference: heel drop: 12mm (24mm in the front, 36mm in the back). Please continue reading for a high-visibility comparison of Wave Rider 26 & 27. The two models have almost identical configurations, with the biggest difference being the last. Rider 27 has two lasts, a regular last and a 2E extra wide last. However, compared to the previous generation, the wide last of the 27th version is approximately between a regular D last and a 2E last, while the 2E extra wide last is similar to a regular 2E last.

The last design of the 26th version can be said to be a significant increase compared to the 27th version. The 2E extra wide last of the 26th version is approximately equivalent to a regular 4E last, so you need to pay attention to the size selection of these two shoes.

PS: Rider 27 has released a limited edition color for breast cancer, available for both men and women, very attractive! Please continue reading for the difference in upper: Both shoes have a similar design in terms of the upper. Rider 27 uses floral breathable mesh upper with TPU accents, while the 26th version also uses TPU strips. They have similar performances in terms of breathability, support, and stability, including reinforced durability in places like the lace holes.

The dual-layer breathable mesh upper is not too thick, so you don't have to worry too much about breathability. Even with temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius, there is no overly stuffy feeling after running. Although it may not have the same breathability as racing shoes, where you can feel the breeze when riding a motorcycle, taking off the Rider shoes after a run, your socks won't feel damp and hot. They are also suitable for daily wear. If the breathability of racing shoes is rated 95 out of 100, Rider 26 & 27 should score around 75. They also have similar performances in terms of stability and support. The tongue design of Rider 26 & 27 is also quite similar, with a breathable tongue of moderate thickness. The thickness of the tongue can reduce the pressure from the laces. The 27th version has larger mesh holes and both tongues use a half-sock design to prevent them from moving around. Another difference is the length of the laces! The laces of Rider 26 are really too long, even with the bunny ear lacing method, they are still quite long. The regular lacing method may even reach the ground. In Rider 27, the length of the laces has been adjusted. In terms of heel design, the height of the collar and the thickness of the padding are not significantly different. When pressing the built-in cup-shaped stability plate, there seems to be a slight difference. In Rider 27, the curvature of the heel is smoother. However, in terms of stability, support, and fit, there is not much difference. It is still stable and does not require much attention.

Midsole difference: Both Rider 27 and 26 use a dual-layer Enerzy cushioning material with a Wave Plate stability plate embedded in the middle. I remember when I jumped from the 24th version to the 26th version, the difference in foot feel was quite obvious. It felt too soft and comfortable at the time. The dual-layer Enerzy cushioning midsole is soft and provides a slightly elastic foot feel. Although the cushioning may not be top-notch for extreme running, as a daily training shoe for someone with a weight of 82kg like me, it is more than enough. It is suitable for easy runs, long slow distance (LSD) runs, and other steady-paced runs.

The Wave Rider series is designed for runners who finish a full marathon in approximately 4.5 hours. Therefore, running at a pace of around 5 minutes 30 seconds to 6 minutes per kilometer is highly recommended. It has a perfect balance of not being too heavy or too light, providing a comfortable running experience. Its speed increase performance is also not bad. Overall, it is a well-balanced shoe without any particularly outstanding features. For example, if you are looking for a propulsion system like carbon-plated shoes or an extremely soft cushioning feel, you won't find them in the Rider series. It may even be a bit challenging to use them for intervals at a pace of 4 minutes 30 seconds per kilometer. However, for daily training, they are definitely more than enough.

The built-in Wave Plate stability plate provides good support and stability in the soft midsole. It does not put too much burden on the ankles, making it suitable for recovery runs. Although the Rider series is not a stability shoe, its support is already among the top-class for regular shoes. It feels like more than friends but not yet lovers. Therefore, it is very friendly for runners who are just starting out and still training their muscles.

When you put on both shoes and step on them, there is actually not much difference in terms of the feeling of stepping on the midsole. Only when you wear one shoe on each foot, you can feel that the 27th version seems to be slightly softer by about 10%. But the difference is not significant (the height of the midsole of the two shoes differs by 2mm). PS: Wave Rider 26 & 27 also have foam insoles similar to Ortholite, which provide a good foot feel.
