 As LeBron James enters his 21st season in the NBA, is he really getting old?

At 38 years old, James has taken good care of his body and remains in top physical shape, making it hard to believe that he will turn 39 on December 30th. This number is especially scary for a professional athlete.

The NBA official social media team asked James about being the league's oldest player, to which he responded with a cartoonish scream and then proceeded to easily score a dunk in a simulated game. â˜»Please continue reading for James' reaction to being considered the oldest player in the league: https://x.com/NBA/status/1710053275750244726?s=20

Howard Beck explains that it is extremely rare for any professional athlete to play in their 21st season.

What James is attempting to do now is unprecedented in the NBA. Playing at a high level for a team like the Los Angeles Lakers is a challenge for young players, but for a 39-year-old veteran, it is even more difficult.

At least James was able to do it at 37 and 38, especially in the second half of last season when the Lakers made an incredible run and advanced to the Western Conference Finals.

Howard Beck describes it as the best performance in the 20th season by any veteran in NBA history.

Now entering his 21st season, James joins the likes of Robert Parish, Kevin Willis, Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, and Dirk Nowitzki as the sixth player to reach this milestone, and he is still a starting member of the Lakers.

No one doubts his ambition to compete for a championship, and he is still in the running for league MVP, with his veteran skills giving us goosebumps just thinking about it, right? Please continue reading to see James' recent performance and how it translates to this season. In his first season with the Lakers, James played 55 out of 82 games, and in the shortened 2020-2021 season, he played 45 out of 72 games. In the past two seasons, he played 56 and 55 games respectively, but still managed to maintain impressive averages of 28.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 6.8 assists. Unfortunately, his numbers took a hit in the second half of last season due to a foot injury, with a decrease of 4 points per game and a 6% drop in three-point shooting, yet he still averaged 24.5 points, 9.9 rebounds, and 6.5 assists per game.

Therefore, it is necessary for the coaching staff to adjust and ensure that this veteran stays healthy and performs well in the playoffs, otherwise, there is a risk of a repeat of last season's decline, which could affect the Lakers' chances at a championship. In addition to his own performance, James is also a mentor on the Lakers team, guiding the young players on the team. Rookie Rui Hachimura, who joined the team in a trade last season, has been training with the superstar every day. James says, "My relationship with Rui Hachimura is like the relationship between Daniel-san and Mr. Miyagi in the movie "The Karate Kid", passing on my skills to him."

Normally, we wouldn't expect much from a 39-year-old player, but this is LeBron James we are talking about. From every perspective, he has no intention of retiring and still has a strong desire to win.

Please continue reading for James' interview where he says, "I never consider being mentally and physically tired because once you start thinking about it, it will actually happen. Fatigue only exists in your mind. If you tell yourself you're tired, your body will feel tired. I don't have this thought, so I don't feel tired handling a long season." In any case, this is not just a 21-season veteran, but a once in a lifetime prodigy. If he doesn't feel tired, then we should sit back and appreciate his greatness.
