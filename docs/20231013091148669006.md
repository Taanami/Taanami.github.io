  The PLG accuses Taishin of lacking sincerity and officially files a lawsuit against the Hsinchu Attack Lions.

The Hsinchu Attack Lions basketball team respects the results of the first mediation meeting held by the Chinese Basketball Association on (date), and looks forward to Taishin's proposal for negotiations. However, today the Attack Lions received a response from Taishin rejecting negotiations and choosing to hide behind the players to avoid responsibility, clearly violating the conclusion of the meeting. As a result, the Attack Lions officially filed a lawsuit this afternoon.

Taishin has stated that they refuse to negotiate with the Attack Lions as a team, and only agree to deal with the contract dispute through Lin Ping-sheng alone. The Attack Lions believe that this goes against the consensus reached at the first mediation meeting, and that Lin Ping-sheng's absence from the meeting without reason and Taishin's inconsistent attitude show a lack of sincerity in negotiations. Therefore, the Attack Lions, accompanied by their appointed legal team, went to the Taipei District Court this afternoon to sue Lin Ping-sheng for damages in regards to the team's losses. They also filed a joint claim against Taishin for joint tort liability and violation of Article 25 of the Fair Trade Act.

In addition, they have also filed a complaint with the Fair Trade Commission against Taishin.
