 Jeremy Lin, a former NBA player of Taiwanese descent, has officially announced that he will be joining the PLG Kaohsiung Steelers in Taiwan. The announcement was made by the team, and Lin also shared a photo on social media wearing the team's jersey, expressing his excitement to come to Kaohsiung.

Rumors of Lin's return to Taiwan to play basketball have been circulating since the end of last year. However, the team had not confirmed the news until now. The PLG League's Kaohsiung Steelers chose to make the announcement on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, causing a sensation in Taiwan's basketball scene. Lin's addition to the team, along with the recent signings of other NBA stars like Dwight Howard, brings together two big basketball stars in Taiwan.

Lin's decision to return to play in Taiwan comes after his departure from the CBA's Guangzhou Long Lions in China at the end of last year. Lin's younger brother, Lin Shu-wei, currently plays for the PLG team New Taipei Kings, and Jeremy had expressed his desire to play alongside his brother. Although they won't be playing on the same team, they will have the opportunity to compete against each other in the league, taking a step towards their dream of playing together.

In addition to sharing a photo of himself wearing the Steelers' jersey on social media, Lin also wrote, "Kaohsiung, I'm here." Many fans have expressed their support and excitement for Lin's return to Taiwan to play basketball.

The Kaohsiung Steelers, as the only team in southern Taiwan in the P. LEAGUE+, have been promoting the "Great Southern Project" to address the imbalance between the north and south in Taiwan's basketball resources. With Lin's support and participation, the team hopes to make significant progress in this project.

Lin's basketball journey has been filled with ups and downs. He gained international attention during his time with the New York Knicks in the NBA, where he led the team to a winning streak and became a global sensation known as "Linsanity." He has also played in top professional leagues such as the CBA and won an NBA championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019. Lin's determination and resilience have made him a respected figure in the basketball world.

With Lin joining the Kaohsiung Steelers, he is expected to become a key player for the team and bring valuable experience to the backcourt. His addition will not only boost the team's performance but also provide more opportunities for young talents like Chen Yu-wei and Wang Lu-xiang to develop their skills.

As a devout Christian, Lin has a special connection to the Kaohsiung Fengshan Gymnasium, the home stadium of the Kaohsiung Steelers. In 2016, he shared his life experiences and faith with nearly 5,000 believers and fans at the stadium. Lin's basketball career has been marked by overcoming challenges and discrimination, and he continues to inspire others with his resilience and determination.

The Kaohsiung Steelers' general manager, Gao Jing-yan, revealed that Lin has always had a sense of responsibility and a mission for his own development and the overall development of basketball. He understands that basketball resources in Taiwan have been concentrated in the north, while the south has been relatively neglected. With Lin's joining, the team hopes to change the basketball culture in southern Taiwan and bring more resources and improvements to the market.

Jeremy Lin's basketball journey has been defined by defying expectations. Despite facing setbacks, he has achieved success and recognition both on and off the court. Now, with his decision to join the Kaohsiung Steelers, fans are eagerly anticipating whether he can replicate the success of "Linsanity" and become a savior for the team.
