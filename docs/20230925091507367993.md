 NBA player Nikola Jokic, the center for the Denver Nuggets, is a champion, NBA Finals MVP, and two-time MVP. He is considered one of the best basketball players currently active. However, it is apparent that his passion for horse racing surpasses his interest in basketball. This can be seen from his performance during the championship and is also acknowledged by his former teammate Austin Rivers. When asked by sports media personality Bill Simmons about how long he thinks Jokic will continue playing, Rivers responded, "No, there is absolutely no possibility of him playing until he's 39." Rivers further stated, "I think he will play for another 5 or 6 years. He really doesn't care about American popular culture, trends, or fame. He has no interest in those things. What interests him is not those things."
