 NBA once again traded Jrue Holiday to the Celtics.

Photo/Reuters According to reporters Adrian Wojnarowski and Shams Charania, the Trail Blazers have sent Jrue Holiday to the Celtics in exchange for Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams, and the 2024 Warriors' first-round pick (top-four protected) and the 2029 Celtics' unprotected first-round pick. The details of the trade are as follows: Wojnarowski also reported that the Celtics were one of the teams that Holiday wanted to go to, and they were willing to keep him for a long time.

Holiday has one year left on his contract with a player option for the following year. Boston's offer beat out many other teams in the league that were also interested in acquiring Holiday. In recent trades, the Trail Blazers have sent out players such as Damian Lillard and Holiday in exchange for Deandre Ayton, Robert Williams, Malcolm Brogdon, and Toumani Camara, as well as three first-round picks (the 2024 Warriors' top-four protected pick, the 2029 Celtics' unprotected pick, and the Bucks' unprotected pick) and two pick swaps (the Bucks' 2028 and 2030 picks). The Trail Blazers' current plan is to keep Robert Williams and pair him with Ayton, while Brogdon is expected to be traded again as the team focuses on developing young guards.
