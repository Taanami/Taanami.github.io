 In a surprising move, the Sacramento Kings have decided to waive Nerlens Noel, who they just signed in the summer, along with young player Neemias Queta. The main reason for this decision is the recent signing of center JaVale McGee, who was recently waived by the Dallas Mavericks. The Kings signed Noel to a one-year, $3.1 million contract on July 19 (link to news), but with the addition of McGee, the center position became overcrowded, leading to the decision to let go of two centers at once.

It was reported at the time that Noel's contract was not fully guaranteed and he would have to play the entire season to receive the full $3.1 million. However, in less than two months, the Kings found a better backup center and decided to release Noel to seek a new team. With this move, the Kings' center rotation will consist of starter Domantas Sabonis, with Alex Len and JaVale McGee coming off the bench. In the 2022-23 regular season, Nerlens Noel has played for the Pistons and Nets, appearing in 17 games and averaging 11.5 minutes per game, with 2.1 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 0.9 steals per game.
