 Article: In the fourth quarter of the first game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference first round, Grizzlies guard Ja Morant fell to the ground in pain after a drive and went straight to the locker room due to a hand injury, ending his battle in that game.

Subsequently, the Los Angeles Lakers turned a closely contested game into an easy away victory. Soon after, a similar scene unfolded in Milwaukee, as Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo lay on the court in agony, clutching his back.

Without Antetokounmpo, the Bucks lost the opportunity to win their first game of the series.

Morant and Antetokounmpo, the two star players of their respective teams, not only suffered injuries in the playoffs, but also had something in common: the way they got injured. Both Morant and Antetokounmpo fell hard after driving to the basket, with defenders attempting to draw an offensive foul.

Anthony Davis successfully blocked Morant, while Kevin Love was called for a foul, sending Antetokounmpo to the free-throw line.

With star players spending less and less time on the court, the league needs to start thinking about how to keep them on the court for longer. Besides raising the threshold for awards, another issue worth discussing is whether the penalties after fouls are sufficient to protect players from unnecessary harm caused by dangerous landings.

Although Morant and Antetokounmpo both missed the following second game, they did not sustain career-ending injuries and returned to play in their respective series.

However, we have seen many promising young stars prematurely fall due to injuries, making it a top priority to avoid the next player with a similar experience.

The most extreme possibility is to prohibit any help defenders from drawing offensive fouls, an idea proposed by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban in his personal blog in 2004. Cuban acknowledged that the Mavericks were good at drawing offensive fouls and that players willing to endure physical pain for defensive purposes should be commended, but he believed that this rule was "terrible" for the NBA. He mentioned in the article, "Not only does it put both players at risk of injury, but it also weakens some of the most exciting and watchable performances in basketball.

Players no longer focus on launching spectacular, incredible shots towards the basket, but instead lower their heads and look at the ground to see if someone will try to impede them by drawing an offensive foul."

It is worth noting that this proposal would not reduce the blocks made by primary defenders to prevent players like Antetokounmpo from attacking the basket.

According to ESPN Stats & Info, he committed 233 offensive fouls on drives in the past 10 seasons, and that only happened when facing opponents who tried to block his drives.

Furthermore, even if players can knock down help defenders without being called for traveling, NBA rules also prohibit players from initiating "non-basketball contact" beyond the cylinder concept, meaning that deliberate unnecessary shoving against help defenders is not allowed.

However, in this era where offensive efficiency is higher than ever before, such changes seem to favor the offensive side too much.

When Cuban proposed this idea in 2004, offensive efficiency was at its lowest, so they had to find a way to give an advantage to offensive players. The league's average offensive efficiency in the 2003-04 season was 101.4 points per 100 possessions.

This season, that number has risen to 114.1. It is commendable that even before Morant was born, the NBA already had a rule aimed at preventing player injuries, which is the "restricted area" under the basket, and since the 1997-98 season, the restricted area has been expanded to its current size (four-foot radius). The NBA was the first league to introduce the restricted area, and later NCAA and FIBA also adopted this regulation.

However, since the implementation of this rule 26 years ago, the game has undergone significant changes. Back then, the offensive range was much smaller than it is now.

In the 1997-98 season, only 16% of shots came from three-pointers, while this season, the proportion of three-point attempts has reached 39%. As long-range three-pointers become more common, the average shooting distance continues to increase.

According to ESPN's statistics, in the 1997-98 season, the average distance of jump shots outside the paint was 18.4 feet (excluding logo shots), while this season, the average shooting distance outside the paint is 22.8 feet, an increase of over 4 feet compared to the past. The expanded offensive space requires defenders to cover more ground, which means they are more likely to move actively to legal defensive positions near the ball handler when they jump from outside the paint.

According to the rules, this "delayed standing" defensive action is prohibited. Defenders are not allowed to enter the path of the offensive player when the offensive player starts to receive the ball and jump towards the basket.

In other words, as long as the offensive player starts to jump towards the basket after receiving the ball, the defender cannot try to step into a position outside the restricted area to draw an offensive foul, which was the reason Love was called for a foul when defending Antetokounmpo. However, in practice, referees find it difficult to simultaneously determine the position of the defender and the timing of the offensive player's jump. Therefore, whether the defender is within the restricted area often becomes the primary criterion for distinguishing between a blocking foul and an offensive foul. That's why Cuban advocates for increasing the radius of the restricted area to five feet. This suggestion is not made hastily; as early as 2006, Cuban publicly proposed expanding the restricted area and hoped it would "cover the entire paint." If the restricted area were larger, Morant's injury case would be considered Davis's foul, and Davis would not attempt to draw an offensive foul at the first opportunity. Instead, Davis might prepare to block Morant's shot, which is his expertise. He contributed a total of seven blocks on Sunday, repeatedly denying the Grizzlies' offense.
