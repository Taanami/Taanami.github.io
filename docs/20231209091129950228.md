 Before leaving, Terry Stotts had a disagreement with head coach Adrian Griffin over a meeting issue.

The reason was that after the shootaround, Griffin told the coaching staff that he wanted to have a separate meeting, but Stotts went to talk to the players about offensive issues. Griffin asked Stotts to join the coaches' meeting, and Stotts requested some time to talk to the players, but Griffin yelled at him in front of the whole team, telling him to join the coaches' meeting immediately. Reporters speculate that this incident is not the sole reason for Stotts' departure, as he has been a head coach for several decades and may have struggled to adjust to a coaching role on the bench. Some also believe that he did not receive the respect and treatment he deserved based on his experience. 

 When asked about Stotts' departure, Griffin said in a press conference earlier today, "It was surprising for all of us, but we support him. He's a great guy. I've learned a lot from him in the few months I've been here. He's done a great job in his role. This is a personal decision, and all we can do is respect it." When asked about the reason for Stotts' departure, Griffin told reporters that it was not a question he should answer and should be directed to Stotts for clarification. "You'll have to ask Terry. I'm just glad to have gotten to know him. He's a great coach and a great person. It's his decision, and I can only wish him the best." Damian Lillard was also asked about Stotts' departure today, to which he responded, "We talked directly. I don't expect anything to be different. We've been in this league together for a long time. We spend 7-8 months together, practicing, flying together, staying at hotels, having dinner together, watching game footage. We're often in the same space together." "Like I said, I've been playing for him for 9 years, and we've been together for a long time. Even in the two years he wasn't the head coach, we kept in touch. So when he called me directly, I didn't expect anything to be different. That's just how it is."
