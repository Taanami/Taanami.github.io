 NBA legend Magic Johnson, who has invested in baseball and American football teams after retiring, recently mentioned his interest in becoming a shareholder of an NBA team. He specifically mentioned the New York Knicks as the only team he is interested in. However, Johnson believes that his association with the Los Angeles Lakers may impact his ability to invest in a basketball team. He expressed his admiration for the passionate basketball fans in New York and his enjoyment of watching Knicks games at Madison Square Garden. While Johnson has been approached by other teams, such as the Warriors, Pistons, and Hawks, to become a shareholder, he declined due to potential competition with the Lakers. Johnson has not yet discussed this topic with Knicks owner James Dolan and does not plan to actively seek a conversation with him. Despite his interest in potentially becoming a Knicks shareholder, Johnson remains committed to supporting the Lakers and is content with his current role within the organization. Since retiring, Johnson has been actively involved in sports affairs, including his previous role as the President of Basketball Operations for the Lakers from 2017 to 2019, where he played a part in signing LeBron James. However, the team did not make the playoffs that year, and Johnson subsequently resigned from his position.
