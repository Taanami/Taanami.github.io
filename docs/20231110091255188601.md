 Introduction: In this article, we have adapted Tim Cato's Mavs mailbag series in a Q&A format, hoping to help everyone better understand the 2023-24 new Dallas Mavericks. The main content of this article includes: 1. According to Jason Kidd, at least one rookie has a chance to enter the starting lineup this year. Who do you think will be the lucky one, Olivier-Maxence Prosper or Dereck Lively II? Like many coaches, Kidd tends to trust veterans rather than young players, but both Lively and O-Max have a high chance of becoming immediate contributors and even pushing into the starting lineup before December, despite Kidd's statement that "teams can't rely on young players to win." However, these two young players are just that good and are worthy of more expectations. Keep reading to find out more about Lively and O-Max's defensive awareness and understanding of their role on the offensive end, which makes them more trustworthy than Josh Green and Jaden Hardy, and closer to the reliable Reggie Bullock, who played his career-high minutes under Kidd last year.

Considering the team's vision of needing a big wing and a starting center, don't be surprised if they get more playing time this season.

As for their future development? It all depends on their own destiny. Further reading: Will there be a successor to "The King of Boxing" Tyson Chandler? Rookie center Dereck Lively and the Mavericks' first summer. Keep reading 2. How will the Mavericks view the roles of Tim Hardaway Jr., Jaden Hardy, and Seth Curry in the new season? THJ and Seth Curry should be ahead of Jaden Hardy in terms of playing time, there should be no doubt about that. Seth has missed an average of 21 games in the past four seasons, and Hardaway is well aware of the team's efforts to trade him, even saying on media day, "To be honest, I'm not even sure if I'll still be playing here this season." If he does get traded, it wouldn't be too surprising. Hardy will be a backup in case of injuries to the above two players, and he can also fill in for Kyrie Irving, especially when he is limited by health issues.

Hardy's ability is enough to earn him more playing time, as we have already seen towards the end of last season, and the coaching staff will continue to find suitable opportunities for him.

Keep reading 3. Will the team be satisfied with their current center rotation? This is a very interesting question. During the offseason, the Mavericks were frequently rumored to be trying to acquire a star center, including Deandre Ayton and Clint Capela, with the former eventually being sent to the Trail Blazers.

Considering that Lively was already being discussed as a possible starter so early on, the team's situation still needs to be further observed.

Perhaps the Mavericks still lack a "starting-level" big man to compete for the championship, but is it really necessary to pay a higher price at this stage? The current center rotation is enough to deal with this year's games, and Lively's rate of growth will determine the direction of this issue. 4. In recent years, the Mavericks have always given us a lot of surprises on the trade deadline, but the composition of the team for this season has already taken shape in the preseason. Can we predict the rotation lineup after the All-Star break? Before answering this question, we have two things to consider. One is "whether the rookies will enter the rotation," and the other is "whether the Mavericks can trade away Hardaway." If we optimistically assume that the answer to both questions is yes, the starting lineup could be Doncic, Irving, Josh Green, Grant Williams, and Dwight Powell; at times, O-Max and Lively will have the opportunity to replace Green and Powell, and Seth Curry and Maxi Kleber will also be key bench players. Derrick Jones Jr. could be the next member to compete for playing time, as his defense and athleticism can complement Doncic well, and he has a stronger presence than his official listed height of 6 feet 5, which could be a small-ball center alternative for Kidd.

As for Richaun Holmes, his role is not that prominent and may overlap with Powell and Lively, so we need to see how things play out when the season starts.

Further reading: A $6 million "win-win-win" gamble? Grant Williams talks about the Celtics' and Mavericks' journey in the trade. This is a lineup with two stars, a quality starter, and a group of young players and veteran reserves.

If Green can make a leap in his fourth year, the situation will be even better. But if the rookies don't perform well, things could get a bit awkward.

Perhaps Doncic will continue to improve the team's strength, and hopefully, THJ's trade will bring back another good player - ideally with a contract that can last until summer, making the team's salary and trade situation healthier - but these are things that need time to prove, and hopefully Doncic will continue to dominate while Irving stays healthy. So there is still a lot to do! (Source: SI.com, Tim Cato)
