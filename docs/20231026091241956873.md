Photo/Reuters NBA free agency transfer focus figure Dillon Brooks transferred to the Rockets this summer, leaving the only team he has played for before. Today, each team held a media day, and Brooks was also asked about facing the Grizzlies.

"I am very concerned about this. We will face them four times in the new season. I have already marked them down. It's very cool." Brooks said. In addition, Brooks also added that he plays hard no matter which team he plays for. This is my attitude towards basketball and life every day. I want to infect all the team members and prepare them for new challenges. Brooks spent a very difficult time with the Grizzlies, in addition to being defeated by the seventh seed Lakers in the first round, the team wanted to trade him in the mid-season, and at the end of the season, they directly told Brooks that they would not renew his contract. For Brooks, these experiences will definitely stay in his mind.

"I know this is a business decision, but I won't forget these things. I will continue to work hard and play my best." Brooks said.
