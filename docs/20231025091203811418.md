 The Charlotte Hornets have announced the release of Kai Jones, who was selected in the first round (19th overall) of the NBA Draft two years ago and traded to the Hornets. Jones averaged 2.7 points and 2 rebounds in his two years with the team. The NBA rookie contract is a 2+2 team option, and the Hornets had already exercised their option for the 23-24 season last year. However, with so many changes happening this summer, the Hornets have decided to cut their losses and release Kai Jones. The team will still have to pay his salary for this year and it will count towards their salary cap. Jones has been making headlines on the internet for his unique personality, but with the team's roster already full, it may have been a factor in the decision to release him.
