 RegBulls refers to BedBull, also known as the Chicago Bulls in the Regular Season. According to most season predictions, we may not have to consider the playoffs, so I want to take a different approach.

 In the first game at home, the Bulls started off strong and gave a refreshing performance in the first half. However, they were completely overshadowed by the Thunder in the second half, and it was reported that the players immediately held a meeting with only players in attendance. Let's review this game using the following points.

 Please continue reading below for "Stats": Last season, the Bulls had the lowest three-point attempts per game in the league at 28.9. In this game, they attempted 42 shots, although only 12 were made with a dismal shooting percentage. However, this at least shows that the team is moving towards improving their shot distribution.

 Please continue reading below for "Good": The Bulls outperformed the Thunder in offensive rebounds and steals, which also gave them many more shot opportunities. "Bad": They were completely torn apart by the Thunder's Drive and Kick plays in the second half, which led to the Thunder's already hot hands becoming even more dominant. Was this the result of defensive strategy decisions? "Player": The player I want to highlight the most in this game is Torrey Craig. His presence allows for more versatility in the Bulls' lineup, and he may be able to pair up with the young wing players to create some bold lineups. "Moment": There were three moments that I think are worth mentioning: The first was the first shot of the game, which was a single-handed shot by Patrick Williams. The second was the first three-pointer of the game, which was made by DeMar DeRozan. The third was when Andre Drummond used a crossover move to shake off Chet Holmgren and score.

 "Next": The Raptors, who no longer have Fred VanVleet, have also changed coaches to Darko Rajakovic. Even without tanking, they have managed to maintain a competitive presence in the Eastern Conference with players like Scottie Barnes leading the way and Dennis Schroder, the World Cup MVP.
