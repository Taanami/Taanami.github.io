  Glory Review of the 2023 Basketball Hall of Fame

Without a doubt, the Basketball Hall of Fame pays tribute to the most outstanding individuals in the industry every summer. However, compared to any previous list of Hall of Fame inductees, this year's list beautifully embodies the ever-changing nature of the sport.

We witnessed the entry of the NBA's winningest coach into the highest hall of basketball. We also saw one of his protégés enter the Hall of Fame, who, in her first year as a head coach, won the WNBA championship, following a brilliant career as a WNBA player.

Please continue reading considering that all five previous regular-season MVP awards were won by foreign players, so it is understandable that three international stars have been included in the list.

Finally, one of the superstars who initiated the trend of super teams will also add a new record to his personal achievements.

Gregg Popovich can be said to be the person in NBA history who knows how to win games better than anyone else. He has won five championship rings, although he has never won consecutive championships. The beauty of his coaching career lies in the fact that the Spurs never relied solely on a championship roster to build a dynasty. Instead, through personnel or stylistic changes, along with subtle adjustments, he cultivated a team of excellent players.

In fact, Popovich was once questioned early in his career. He called Avery Johnson and David Robinson to his home and told them that if the underperforming team lost to the Rockets the next day, he believed he might be fired.

This ignited the team's passion, as they went on to win 31 of their last 36 regular-season games and embarked on a journey of greatness.

Please continue reading that led by former MVPs Tim Duncan and Robinson, the Spurs won the championship in 1999 and again in 2003.

However, in 2005 and 2007, after Tony Parker and Manu Ginóbili became the offensive core, the composition of the lineup underwent fundamental changes. Nevertheless, under Popovich's leadership, the Spurs won championships in those seasons. Just when the GDP combination was criticized due to their age, a miracle happened in 2014.

After the Spurs' appearance in the 2013 NBA Finals, they welcomed a new lineup. With the aging GDP as the core and the addition of superstar Kawhi Leonard, they played an unselfish style of basketball, prioritizing ball movement over individual stardom.

This change led them to defeat the star-studded Heat in five games and win their fifth championship on the biggest stage of the sport.

(Not to be overlooked, under Popovich's guidance, the Spurs made the playoffs for 22 consecutive years, setting an NBA record.)

At the age of 74, Popovich is still the head coach of the Spurs. In a way, he has come full circle in his professional career in San Antonio, with a promising young star on the team and the hope of contending for another championship. Becky Hammon, please continue reading.

Hammon's path to fame was not easy, even as a scorer. Her skills and talent as a precise shooter were somewhat overlooked, and her journey in high school was not ideal. She then went on to Colorado State University and was not selected in the professional league draft.

However, she quickly made the managers who ignored her look foolish with her dominant performances. She showcased not only the skills of a sharpshooter but also the exceptional vision and gritty playing style of a point guard.

She began her professional career with the New York Liberty, where she became a fan favorite before being traded to the San Antonio Silver Stars.

In the 2007, 2008, and 2009 seasons, she averaged 18.8, 17.6, and 19.5 points, respectively. (In 2008, Hammon led the Silver Stars to the WNBA Finals and became the seventh player in WNBA history to reach the 5,000-point milestone.)

Hammon suffered an ACL tear in 2013, which ended her playing career. During her recovery, Popovich allowed her to participate in Spurs practices and coaching meetings, and then invited her to join the team in 2014, becoming the first full-time female assistant coach in league history. Since leaving that position at the end of 2021, Hammon became the first female coach in WNBA history to win a championship in her first season and may begin her own illustrious coaching career with the Las Vegas Aces.

When Dwyane Wade led the Miami Heat to their first championship in 2006, this Marquette University player was considered the NBA's premier player for a period of time. Wade may not have been the most outstanding outside shooter, but whenever he took off from mid-range, he was a moving threat. Besides his long-range shooting, he excelled in other areas.

Wade was an exceptional basketball player and a suffocating defender. Despite standing only 6 feet 4 inches tall, he holds the NBA record for the most blocks by a guard. True to his nickname "Flash," he was an agile slasher and would cut to the basket when defenders least expected it.
