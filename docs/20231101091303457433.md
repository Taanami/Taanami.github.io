 Revolutionary Impact of the 2023 NBA Finals Vol.3: The Fierce Battle Between JokiÄ‡ and Embiid, the Gap Between the Nuggets and 76ers

This year's NBA Finals have been full of surprises. The Nuggets and Heat, who made it to the final stage, were not favored to advance this far before the playoffs began.

The Heat started from the play-in round and after losing their first game to the Hawks, they fought their way back and became the second eighth-seeded team in history to make it to the NBA Finals. The Nuggets also overcame multiple obstacles, defeating the Timberwolves with their twin towers, eliminating the Suns with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker, and sweeping the Lakers led by LeBron James and Anthony Davis. They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history and lifted the championship trophy.

Please continue reading below to learn about the 46-year-long perseverance that led to the Nuggets' first championship in franchise history. In NBA history, no other team has endured a longer wait than the Nuggets.

The key player in the championship victory, Nikola JokiÄ‡, is a non-traditional MVP. He was drafted in the second round in 2014, as the 41st pick by the Nuggets. Interestingly, when he was selected, the draft broadcast was interrupted by a Taco Bell commercial.

Today, JokiÄ‡ has become the first player in NBA history to be selected outside of the lottery and win both the regular season MVP and Finals MVP awards.

The above, whether it is the matchup or the Finals MVP, highlights the extraordinary nature of this year's NBA Finals. The unique experiences of the Nuggets and Heat also bring many insights to the league's ecosystem. This series will analyze the revolutionary impact that the Nuggets and Heat series has brought to the basketball world in three articles.

In the previous article, we discussed how the Nuggets won the championship with their steady interior attack, which stands out in today's basketball world dominated by three-point shooting. Their success may spark a new wave of renaissance. This article will focus on the tactical core of the Nuggets - JokiÄ‡. The term "chandelier complex" is a perfect description for the competition between Nikola JokiÄ‡ and Joel Embiid, who have been ranked first and second in the MVP voting for three consecutive seasons. However, while JokiÄ‡ belongs to the Nuggets, who ended a 46-year-long championship drought this year, Embiid's 76ers have been eliminated in the second round of the playoffs for the third consecutive year.

Although he has been unable to win the MVP award, JokiÄ‡ has once again outperformed Embiid in a different way.

In terms of team lineup, the Nuggets have a much more complete and well-rounded roster, and their offensive and defensive systems are also slightly better than the 76ers.

In this year's playoffs, the 76ers' offense mainly relies on three strategies: Embiid's low-post isolation, the high pick-and-roll between James Harden and Embiid, and forcing the opponent to switch defensively with screens and then taking advantage of the mismatch with either Harden or Embiid. In general, the 76ers' offense is based on individual play. On the other hand, the Nuggets have a wide range of tactical variations. JokiÄ‡ can handle the ball in the low post and can also act as a facilitator from the high post. He can also work together with guards in a two-man game. Additionally, the Nuggets' players have excellent awareness of moving without the ball and setting screens, constantly keeping the ball and players in motion, making it difficult for opponents to defend.

Even when JokiÄ‡ and Jamal Murray execute the pick-and-roll, the shooters positioned in the corner are not just standing still, waiting for the ball. They are constantly seeking opportunities to cut to the basket. Furthermore, in the face of the Heat's trademark zone defense, a comparison between the Celtics and Nuggets shows the Nuggets' deep tactical knowledge.

The Celtics, who were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals, mainly used high pick-and-roll to create mismatches and then attack the defender who had to switch. However, when the Heat changed their zone defense from "2-3" to "1-2-2" or "2-2-1," this weakness was easily exploited.

In contrast, the Nuggets have more options to counter zone defense. In addition to pick-and-roll, JokiÄ‡ can also play as a facilitator from the high post, disrupting the Heat's defensive formation.

Moreover, in Game 3 of the NBA Finals, the Nuggets even used the triangle offense, a tactic commonly seen in European basketball, to break through the zone defense.

Despite the fact that every team wants a once-in-a-generation talent or even form a "Big Three," the comparison between the Nuggets and 76ers proves that having an MVP-level player does not guarantee dominance. The key is still finding suitable role players and a diverse tactical system to support the star player's performance.
