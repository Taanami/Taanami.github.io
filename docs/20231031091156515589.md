 NBA player Rui Hachimura has made an appearance in the popular Japanese animation "Crayon Shin-chan" and will join the show's main characters, Shin-chan and Shiro, in their fight against a meteor attack. The episode will air next week (11/4) on Asahi TV.

The collaboration takes place on the streets of Los Angeles, where Hachimura will team up with Shin-chan and Shiro. In the episode, the characters get too absorbed in practicing basketball and forget to eat, leading to a frenzy of burger eating. Later, a meteor threatens their planet and Hachimura uses his basketball skills to destroy it, ultimately making a slam dunk in space.

In an interview, Hachimura expressed his excitement for the collaboration, saying "My family and I are all big fans of 'Crayon Shin-chan.' In the episode, I appear as myself and work with Shin-chan to tell the story of his slam dunk in space. It was my first time doing voice acting and it was really fun. It was a dream come true and I hope they invite me back again!"
