 NBA's new naturalized player candidate Onyeka Okongwu is open to representing the Philippine national team.

Onyeka Okongwu, the center for the Hawks, is open to playing for the Philippine men's basketball national team, according to a report by Filipino media outlet Rappler. If Okongwu successfully becomes a naturalized player, it will greatly enhance the strength of the Philippine men's basketball team in the paint.

Okongwu grew up in a Filipino community in Chino Hills, California, and he also trains with PBA star Alex Cabagnot and Fil-Am Nation.

According to the report by Naveen Ganglani, the Nigerian men's basketball team is also interested in naturalizing Okongwu, but the Philippines has an overall advantage. Okongwu is currently seeking his second NBA contract and will become a restricted free agent after the next season. Last season, Okongwu averaged 9.9 points, 7.2 rebounds, 1.3 blocks, with a shooting percentage of 64% and a free throw percentage of 78% for the Hawks.
