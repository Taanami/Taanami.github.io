Chinese Taipei men's basketball team, represented by the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, lost to the host China team with a score of 69-89 in the "Strait Battle" today, shattering their goal of securing the top spot in the Hangzhou Asian Games men's basketball group. Tseng Wen-ting, the 39-year-old veteran, admitted that although the team had a long training period and showed visible improvement, it was still "not enough". After starting training in June this year, the Chinese Taipei men's basketball team underwent training in Japan, participated in the Jones Cup, and then went to Australia for two weeks before evaluating their performance in the Hangzhou Asian Games. Although they won their first game against Hong Kong, their offense broke down in the first half today, leading to a 20-point defeat. Tseng Wen-ting, who returned to the national team, frankly said, "We have had such a long training period, and there has been improvement, but honestly, it's not enough. We need to get better and elevate everyone within the limited time."

Tseng Wen-ting pointed out the problem, mentioning that all the players in the Chinese Taipei team are main players in their respective clubs, but when they enter the national team, they need to switch roles and mindsets, and find ways to help the team within the limited time and possession.

The Chinese Taipei team has been plagued by injuries in the backcourt this year. The original main point guard, Chen Ying-jun, was absent from the Asian Games due to injury, which forced shooting guard Lin Ting-chien, who usually plays a scoring role, to step up as the team's commander. He rated his performance as a point guard today with 7 assists as "unsatisfactory". There were many deficiencies in the first two games of the group stage, and they still need to reflect and strengthen. Lin Ting-chien, 23, participated in the CBA draft in 2020 and showcased his skills with the Tianjin Ronggang Pioneer team. In July, he announced the signing of a 3-year maximum contract extension with Tianjin. Today, he has also become the focus of attention for the Chinese media. Lin Ting-chien mentioned that after three seasons in the CBA, he expected to face high-intensity physical confrontations today. The actual game on the court was not much different from the CBA, but the atmosphere of the Asian Games and the CBA league were completely different, and the referee's standards also varied. It was still a different experience.
