#  Lin Shuhao is coming to Taiwan 
  Lin Shuhao is coming to Taiwan. After becoming a sensation in the last season of Taiwan's professional basketball league PLG, Lin Shuhao announced last Thursday that he will be joining the New Taipei Kings, fulfilling his dream of playing with his younger brother Lin Shuwei. The Kings have also announced that Lin has arrived in Taiwan and will attend a press conference tomorrow afternoon to officially join the team.

With extensive experience in the NBA, Lin Shuhao joined the Kaohsiung Steelers in the middle of last season and helped turn the team's losing record around. Although the Steelers missed the playoffs due to Lin's concussion in the last game of the regular season, he has proven himself as a superstar in the PLG and has broken multiple assist records.

After celebrating his 35th birthday in August, Lin Shuhao announced that he will continue to play for another season. He then made the decision to join the New Taipei Kings, fulfilling his lifelong dream of playing with his brother Lin Shuwei. The brothers are excited to join forces and help the team, with Lin Shuhao calling it a dream come true and thanking the Kings for the opportunity.

The details of the collaboration between Lin Shuhao and the Kings are still being discussed, but it has been confirmed that Lin will wear the number 7 jersey previously worn by Lin Li-jen. The Kings have also announced that Lin has arrived in Taiwan and will attend a press conference at 4:30 pm tomorrow, along with CEO Chen Hsin-sheng, GM Mao Chia-en, and head coach Ryan. The press conference is expected to end at 5 pm and Lin will immediately join the team's training session in the evening.
