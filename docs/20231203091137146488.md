Aaron Gordon, known for his explosive energy, was a key player in the Nuggets' championship win last season. Not only did he shine on the court, but his shoe game also caught people's attention.

In this review, we will be unboxing Aaron Gordon's shoe from the NBA Finals, the "Aaron Gordon 361° Zen 5 'People's Champion (Ren Min Bravo).' Let's take a closer look at what makes this shoe so special. The design of the "361° Zen 5" is inspired by the game of Go, incorporating the concept of the "circular heaven and square earth" with Go to encourage players to view the game as a strategic battle and take control of the winning position.

The "People's Champion" is one of the signature colorways of the "361° Zen" series. The shoe tongue features the "Zen" logo, and from different angles, the shoe gives off different shades.

The back of the shoe is covered with "Ren Min Bravo" elements, with the 361° logo on one side and Aaron Gordon's number 50 on the other, showing attention to detail. The shoe tongue also features the words "禪 ZEN."

The 361° shoes are known for their outstanding design, and the Zen 5 is no exception. The rubber chessboard pattern on the outsole provides excellent traction, and the internal nylon anti-torsion plate offers stability. This shoe is perfect for players who rely on their explosive energy, as it provides great grip and torsion resistance.

As for dirt and dust, the Zen 5 has a strict anti-dust control on the outsole. The rubber material is hard and not sensitive to dust, making it suitable for indoor and outdoor courts.

The midsole features 361° technologies, including the full-length "Enrg X" and the "Quick CQ Tech" in the forefoot. The TPU reinforcement on the front and side of the shoe provides both bounce and protection. The cushioning is comfortable, and there is no disjointed feeling when running. For lighter players, the cushioning in the heel is perfect, with no risk of losing stability.

The upper is made of TPU shuttle weaving and hot-melt material, providing excellent lateral support for movements like running, cutting, and stepping. The multiple layers of materials in the upper also provide both breathability and support.

Overall, the Zen 5 is a comfortable and secure basketball shoe, perfect for outdoor play. It offers strong containment and is an improvement from the Zen 3 and 4. If you're interested, be sure to get your hands on a pair!
