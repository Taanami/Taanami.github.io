In the preseason warm-up games this year, the Mavericks traveled to two countries and played three games. Their final stop was Luka Doncic's former team, Real Madrid, before joining the NBA. In this game, Doncic only played for five minutes, while Irving did not play at all. The Mavericks wasted a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter and were overturned by Real Madrid. Doncic was limited to five minutes of playing time due to a left calf injury. This information was announced to the fans before the game. However, Doncic still managed to make three three-pointers during his short appearance.

On the other hand, all players from Real Madrid participated in the game. Facundo Campazzo, who had played for the Mavericks in previous years, made a game-winning three-pointer at the end of the match. Doncic was very happy for his former teammate. Campazzo scored 20 points, 6 rebounds, and 8 assists in this game.

Although this was just an exhibition game, it was evident that Real Madrid took it very seriously. They have already started their regular season. Other players' performances included Guerschon Yabusele scoring 18 points and 9 rebounds, Sergio Llull scoring 19 points and 3 rebounds, Rudy Fernández scoring 14 points and 2 rebounds, and Vincent Poirier scoring 19 points and 10 rebounds. This victory marked the third time in Real Madrid's history that they defeated an NBA team. The previous two victories came against the Raptors in 2007 and the Thunder in 2016.
