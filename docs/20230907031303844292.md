As most of the members of Taichung United are graduating seniors, this tournament serves as an opportunity for them to connect with each other on the basketball court before graduating. The majority of Taichung United members come from traditional A group schools, such as Wan Neng Industrial and Commercial Vocational High School, Hou Zong Senior High School, and Qingnian High School. They have demonstrated their strong abilities in the preliminary and cross-school group stages, narrowly losing to the two-time champion, TGF Firefighters, in the group stage with only a slight difference in points. The team's leader, Wu Yue-ting, performed exceptionally well, scoring 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 6 assists.

It was a close match that went down to the wire, and Wu Yue-ting sealed the victory with a crucial free throw, leading the team to the zone championship game and eventually advancing to the national finals as the zone runner-up.

Wu Yue-ting's outstanding performance on the court has earned him a spot on the Central Region's Best Five. He expresses his gratitude to the Taichung United team manager for always taking care of the players, allowing them to fully showcase their abilities without any worries.

Unfortunately, due to the absence of several players in the national tournament, Taichung United was unable to advance past the group stage. However, they displayed a fighting spirit against strong opponents, which was truly inspiring. Wu Yue-ting hopes that his teammates, who will be going their separate ways in the future, whether choosing to pursue further education or continue playing basketball, will remain committed to their goals and choices, never forgetting their original intentions. Wu Yue-ting will be attending the National Taiwan Sport University, majoring in Sports Science. He chose this university because he wanted to study at a national institution that is close to home. He also hopes to excel in both basketball and academics, believing that he will find his own path at the National Taiwan Sport University and inject new energy into the Sports Science Department.
