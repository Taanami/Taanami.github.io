  US Team Suffers First Defeat to Lithuania in the World Cup

The game between the US and Lithuania in the second stage group stage of the basketball World Cup has concluded.

Lithuania emerged victorious with a score of 110-104, handing the US their first defeat. However, the US team still advanced to the quarterfinals with a record of 4 wins and 1 loss, securing their spot in the Olympics. Led by NBA veteran Jonas Valanciunas, Lithuania managed to defeat the US team with a score of 110-104, even without Domantas Sabonis. The 17-point lead in the first half quickly narrowed down to just 4 points as the US team launched a comeback in the third quarter. By the end of the third quarter, the US team had closed the gap to 65-71.

However, Lithuania maintained their lead with their second unit, with each player contributing evenly and showcasing their strengths. Both teams had already secured their spots in the quarterfinals last week, so this game determined the matchups for the next stage.

As one of the top two teams from the Americas in the World Cup, the US team earned their spot in the Olympics.

The US team, finishing second in the group, will face Italy, the group leader, in the quarterfinals, while Lithuania will take on Serbia.

Jonas Valanciunas scored 12 points, grabbed 7 rebounds, and had 2 blocks. Tadas Sedekerskis contributed 11 points and 11 rebounds, Mindaugas Kuzminskas scored 14 points, Kariniauskas scored 15 points, Ignas Brazdeikis scored 11 points, Tomas Dimsa also scored 11 points, and Eimantas Bendzius scored 10 points.
