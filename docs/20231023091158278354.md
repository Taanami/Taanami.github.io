  P. LEAGUE Warm-up Match Kicking off in Keelung- 916 Hot Start for Cross-League Basketball Invitation Tournament

Amidst the chaos in domestic basketball, as the Chinese national team prepares for the upcoming Asian Games in Hangzhou at the end of this month, the domestic basketball environment has not slowed down. P. LEAGUE+ today released information about the 2023-24 season warm-up matches, and the cross-league tournament that debuted last year is also reported to continue this year. Not only will the newly added T1 League's Taipei Taiwan Beer Brave participate, but also the National Taiwan University of Political Science and the University Basketball Association (UBA) three-time champions will also be joining. Taiwan basketball is very busy during this offseason. Just recently, the William Jones Cup, which had been on hiatus for three years, ended, and the World University Games representative team completed their schedule for the Chengdu World University Games. However, the Asian Olympic qualifiers in August, which Taiwan was supposed to participate in, was ultimately cancelled due to the location, Damascus, Syria, being designated as a red alert travel destination by our government. The originally planned training team, mainly composed of T1 League players, also returned to their respective teams. Please continue reading below.

Two other teams from Taiwan, named "Chinese Blue" and "Chinese White," participated in the Jones Cup. "Chinese Blue" consists of current members of the national team and will also compete in the upcoming Asian Games. In the later stages of the Jones Cup, there was still a dispute regarding the contracts of Lin Ping-sheng, the new signing for Hsinchu JKO Lioneers of the P. LEAGUE+, and Taipei Taiwan Beer Brave of the T1 League. This week, the JKO Lioneers have filed a lawsuit, and it is confirmed that the two parties will settle the issue in court. Additionally, there were also negative rumors of the former head coach of the Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology, who allegedly instructed an assistant to damage a car. Among all these news, it is clear that the offseason in Taiwan basketball has not come to a halt.

Today, P. LEAGUE+ released a statement announcing the schedule for the 2023-24 season warm-up matches. Last year, the warm-up matches were held at the Fengshan Gymnasium in Kaohsiung, and this year, the home team, Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology, is still the partner for the league. However, the location of the matches will not be in Kaohsiung, but will move north to "Rain City," Keelung. The matches will take place from October 7 to 9, with a total of six games, bringing professional basketball back to Keelung, which has not held adult-level basketball games for many years.

Last offseason, P. LEAGUE+, T1 League, and the Super Basketball League (SBL) all participated in a cross-league tournament. In the end, the T1 League Taiwan Beer defeated the Xinbei Citicorns to win the championship, successfully fulfilling the vision of having three leagues/tournaments competing against each other at the same time. Although the teams were all playing for training purposes, the games were still entertaining. This year, there were reports that the tournament will continue even after many international games, and seven teams have already confirmed their participation. Among them, the SBL will have Taiwan Bank, Changhua Bank, and Taiwan Beer participating; P. LEAGUE+ will have Dreamers and Yulon Luxgen Dinos forming an alliance; and the T1 League will have the highly talked-about Taipei Taiwan Beer Brave. Additionally, there will also be a training team for the Asian Games and the UBA's National Taiwan University of Political Science participating.

The SBL teams that participated in the cross-league tournament last year also put up a good fight. This year, they will be participating again. The Taipei Taiwan Beer Brave, which recently formed during the offseason and caused quite a buzz, will finally make their debut in a real game. People will be paying attention to how they perform and whether Lin Ping-sheng will take the court. As for the National Taiwan University of Political Science, who swept through thousands of opponents in the UBA for the past three seasons and was dubbed "Political Universe," whether they can showcase their excellent skills against higher-level teams and prepare for the new UBA season is also a hot topic.
