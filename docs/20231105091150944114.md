On September 23, 2023, the United Daily News/ Special correspondent Tseng Szu-ju/ Hangzhou - The Chinese men's basketball team, who reached the top 4 in the previous Asian Games, arrived in Hangzhou yesterday with the goal of coming out on top in their group.

Photo/ Basketball Association The Chinese men's basketball team, who reached the top 4 in the previous Asian Games, arrived in Hangzhou yesterday. Head coach Tom Maoson stated that all players are currently in good health. Despite being in the same group as the host China, their goal is still to come out on top in the group stage. In the preliminary rounds, the Chinese team was originally placed in Group B with China, Lebanon, and Mongolia, with the top team in the group advancing directly to the quarter-finals. The second and third teams will compete for the remaining two spots. However, Lebanon recently withdrew from the competition and was replaced by Hong Kong, who will be the Chinese team's opponent in their first game on the evening of the 26th.

Maoson mentioned that although their first opponent has changed from Lebanon to Hong Kong, which is a completely different team, there will still be challenges as it is the Asian Games. The team must approach every game with a normal mindset. In the second game against China and the third game against Mongolia, their goal is still to come out on top in the group stage.

One concern for the Chinese team's goal of topping their group is the uncertainty surrounding naturalized player Attinuo's eligibility to play. Maoson said, "We've heard that there will be a team leaders' meeting to make the final confirmation. We asked the team's management yesterday, but we haven't received any news. It seems like he can play, but we still have to wait for the team leaders' meeting." The Chinese team has also prepared for the worst-case scenario. If Attinuo is unable to play, besides Li Dewei, who is originally a center, power forward Zeng Wendong will also have to take on the role of a key player. However, Attinuo is still part of the team's starting lineup and is expected to play alongside Lin Tingqian, Liu Zheng, and Zeng Wendong. The small forward position will be filled by either Li Qiwei or Lu Junxiang, with the "Black Panther" Abassi coming off the bench. "We hope that Abassi can be the best sixth man because he can easily change the game and bring a lot of scoring power to the team," Maoson stated. He also mentioned that Abassi will likely be the sixth man, and the final starting lineup will be chosen between Li Qiwei and Lu Junxiang. Currently, they are leaning towards Lu Junxiang as he can help ease Lin Tingqian's workload as a guard and relieve some pressure from him.
