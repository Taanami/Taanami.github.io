 Article: In the first game of the Western Conference first round between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies, Grizzlies guard Ja Morant fell to the ground in pain after a drive and went straight to the locker room due to a hand injury, ending his fight in the game. Subsequently, the Los Angeles Lakers turned a closely contested game into an easy away victory.

Shortly after, a similar scene played out in Milwaukee, with Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo lying on the court in pain, clutching his back.

Without Antetokounmpo, the Bucks also lost the chance to win their first game of the series.

Morant and Antetokounmpo, the two star players of their respective teams, share a commonality in addition to their injuries: the way they got injured.

Both Morant and Antetokounmpo fell hard after drives, with defenders trying to create offensive fouls. Anthony Davis successfully blocked Morant, while Kevin Love was called for a foul, sending Antetokounmpo to the free-throw line. With star players spending less and less time on the court, the league needs to start thinking about how to get them on the court more.

In addition to raising the threshold for awards, another issue worth discussing is whether the penalties after fouls are enough to protect players from unnecessary injuries caused by dangerous landings.

Although Morant and Antetokounmpo were both absent from the following second game, they did not suffer career-ending injuries and returned to play in their respective series. However, we have seen many promising young stars whose careers were cut short due to injuries, so avoiding the next player with a similar experience has become a top priority. The most extreme possibility is to prohibit any help defenders from creating offensive fouls, an idea proposed by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban in his personal blog in 2004.

Cuban acknowledges that the Mavericks have done well in creating offensive fouls, and players who are willing to endure physical pain for defensive purposes deserve praise, but he believes that this rule is "terrifying" for the NBA. In his article, he mentioned that "it not only exposes both players to the risk of injury, but also weakens some of the most exciting and watchable performances in basketball."

Players no longer focus on launching spectacular and incredible shots towards the basket, but instead keep their heads down, looking to see if someone will try to block them by creating offensive fouls.

It is worth noting that this proposal does not reduce the blocks made by primary defenders to prevent players like Antetokounmpo from attacking the rim. According to ESPN Stats & Info, he committed 233 ball-handler charging offensive fouls in the past 10 seasons, and those were only against opponents who tried to stop him from driving to the basket.

Furthermore, even if players can knock down help defenders without being called for traveling, NBA rules also prohibit players from making "non-basketball contact" outside the concept of their body cylinder, meaning that intentionally pushing or shoving against help defenders is not allowed. However, in this era where offensive efficiency is higher than ever, such changes seem to favor the offense too much.

When Cuban proposed in 2004, offensive efficiency was at its lowest, so they had to find ways to make offensive players more advantageous.

The league's average offensive efficiency in the 2003-04 season was 101.4 points per 100 possessions.

This season, that number has risen to 114.1. It is commendable that long before Morant was born, the NBA already had a rule aimed at preventing player injuries, which is the "restricted area" under the basket, and since the 1997-98 season, the restricted area has been expanded to its current size (four feet in diameter). The NBA was the first league to introduce the restricted area, and later the NCAA and FIBA also adopted this rule.

However, since the implementation of this rule 26 years ago, the game has undergone significant changes.

Back then, the offensive range was much smaller than it is now. In the 1997-98 season, only 16% of shots came from three-pointers, while this season, the proportion of three-point attempts has reached 39%.

With the increasing popularity of long-distance three-pointers, the average shooting distance has also continued to increase. According to ESPN's statistics, in the 1997-98 season, the average distance of jump shots outside the paint was 18.4 feet (excluding logo shots), while this season, the average shooting distance outside the paint is 22.8 feet, an increase of more than 4 feet compared to the past. The expanded offensive space requires defenders to cover more area, which means they are more likely to actively move to their legal defensive positions when the ball handler takes off from outside the paint. According to the rules, this "delayed establishing" defensive action is prohibited.

If defenders try to block offensive players by creating offensive fouls, they are "not allowed to move into the path of the offensive player when he starts his upward shooting motion."

In other words, as long as the offensive player takes off to attack the basket after receiving the ball, the defender cannot try to step into a position outside the restricted area to create an offensive foul. This is the reason why Love's defense against Antetokounmpo was called a foul. However, in reality, it is difficult for referees to accurately judge the defender's position and the timing of the offensive player's takeoff. Therefore, whether the defender is inside the restricted area often becomes the main criterion for distinguishing between blocking fouls and offensive fouls, which is why Cuban advocates for increasing the radius of the restricted area to five feet.

This suggestion was not haphazardly proposed. As early as 2006, Cuban publicly suggested expanding the restricted area to cover the entire paint. If the restricted area were larger, Morant's injury case would be regarded as a foul by Davis, and Davis would not attempt to create an offensive foul in the first place.

Instead, Davis may focus on preparing to block Morant's shot - something he is good at, as he contributed a total of seven blocks on Sunday, repeatedly thwarting the Grizzlies' attacks.
