  Australia: A World Cup Note on Multiculturalism and Basketball Industry Reform

Australia has been a significant force in the development of basketball over the past two decades, and the current national team coaching staff is a reflection of this progress. Head coach Brian Goorjian, who is now 70 years old, is originally from the United States. After graduating from college in 1977, he came to Melbourne and played for the Melbourne Tigers until 1988 when he became the head coach. He can be considered a coach among coaches, having coached players such as Matthew Nielsen, Andrew Gaze, Shane Heal, C.J. Bruton, and Mark Worthington. Many of the players he coached, as well as opponents' players, have now become well-known Australian players, including Dante Exum and Ben Simmons.

The three assistant coaches on the Australian team also have notable backgrounds. Matthew Nielsen, in particular, is well-known in recent Australian basketball history as one of the most representative interior players. He has also had years of experience playing in Europe and has served as an assistant and head coach for the Austin Spurs. Starting in 2021, he joined the San Antonio Spurs.

Adam Caporn has played a crucial role in recent years as a key figure in Australian players' journey to the United States. Before Caporn, players like Nielsen followed a more European path, balancing high school and college education while playing in local leagues and the National Basketball League (NBL). Caporn joined St. Mary's College in California in 2001, becoming a senior player on the team alongside the team's first import, Jonathan Sanders. At the time, St. Mary's was a young program under head coach Randy Bennett, with only around 2,000 students and a modest history in the NCAA tournament. One of the most famous basketball alumni from the school is Mahershala Ali, who has won two Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor.

After Caporn graduated, he helped Australian players find another path to St. Mary's, resulting in a series of Australian players such as Patty Mills, Matthew Dellavedova, Stephen Holt, and Clint Steindl transforming the small college into a mid-major powerhouse on the West Coast. The team even ranked in the preseason Top 25 in the United States.

Another coach with deep connections to Australia is David Patrick. Although he is also originally from the United States, he played a crucial role in bringing Australian players to St. Mary's alongside Caporn. Any team he has been with for more than a season has left a significant mark of Australian players. He is also known for his recruitment skills and connections. He is the godfather of Ben Simmons, helping Simmons secure a spot at LSU in 2013. When Patrick was at TCU, he recruited Kouat Noi, and during his time as head coach at UC Riverside, he brought in five Australian players. Currently, he is with Sacramento State and has brought four players with him. This is Patrick's first time coaching the national team for the entire tournament. In the past, Goorjian has mentioned that the Australian national team cannot do without Ben Simmons, but this year he has hinted that Simmons may still be considered, though the undisclosed reasons behind this change remain a mystery.

Dante Exum, who has struggled with injuries throughout his career, had a breakthrough season with the Belgrade Guerrillas, averaging 13.2 points, 2.7 assists, and shooting 52% from the field and 39% from three-point range in 23 minutes per game. After being involved in a brawl with Guerschon Yabusele, Exum played a total of 74 games in the season, which is the most he has played since 2017.

The Australian team has a significant age gap, with players like Dyson Daniels and Josh Giddey being only 20 years old, while Patty Mills and Joe Ingles are already over 35 years old.

Patty Mills and Joe Ingles participated in the Jones Cup in 2006, alongside Aron Baynes. Although Baynes was born in New Zealand and initially intended to join the New Zealand national basketball team, he ultimately chose to represent Australia after moving there with his family at the age of three.

Aron Baynes, who almost saw his career end last year, had a solid season with the Brisbane Bullets, averaging 11.2 points and 7.6 rebounds in 23 minutes per game. At 36 years old, he still possesses the skills to compete at the NBA level and could potentially continue playing for a few more years.

The Australian team also represents a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds. In addition to white Australians, players like Dyson Daniels, Josh Green, Xavier Cooks, and Dante Exum have fathers who immigrated to Australia to play basketball and settled there. Chris Goulding's father is British and came to Australia to play Australian rules football. Matisse Thybulle's father is of Haitian descent, and although he has no ancestral ties to Australia, he chose to naturalize due to his family's seven-year stay in Sydney during his childhood. Duop Reath was born in South Sudan, and team captain Patty Mills has a unique background as he comes from an indigenous Australian and Torres Strait Islander family. The composition of the entire team is a true reflection of the multiculturalism in Australia.
