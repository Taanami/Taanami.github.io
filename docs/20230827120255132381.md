 The arrival of the San Antonio Spurs' first overall pick, Admiral David Robinson:

"He saved the entire team. That's it." 

Please continue reading as former Spurs owner Red McCombs talked about how important David Robinson, also known as the "Admiral," was to the San Antonio Spurs before the start of the 1999 NBA Finals.

In 1987, the Spurs were in trouble. Their home attendance had been declining for eight consecutive seasons, with an average of only 8,009 fans attending games during the 1986-87 season. They had the smallest market in the NBA and ranked 42nd in the US television market. In terms of revenue, season ticket sales, and any other relevant indicators, the Spurs were at the bottom of the league. The main problem was the team's performance. Since the departure of their star player George Gervin in 1985, who was known as the "Iceman," the Spurs had been in decline. They had never been able to break a winning percentage of .500. "The team was dead," said McCombs. Please continue reading (the disappointing number of spectators on the sidelines) "We were at a critical moment."

That's what the team's general manager, Bob Bass, said at the time. "We need to do something to bring the fans back to the arena." Please continue reading. If the Spurs hadn't been lucky enough to get the first overall pick in 1987, San Antonio might not have been able to keep its last professional sports team, McCombs recalled. NBA Commissioner David Stern told him in 1987 that the Spurs might not survive in San Antonio, and McCombs couldn't argue. However, the Spurs did get the first overall pick, and the basketball history of South Texas was rewritten.

All the hope of the Alamo rested on a seven-foot Naval officer: David Robinson.

Typical NBA top draft picks usually start to shine in seventh or eighth grade. They are taller, faster, and have better basketball skills than their peers. They dominate in high school, attend high-level basketball camps, and are pursued by coaches from top basketball colleges. They make a name for themselves in college basketball and become highly sought-after prospects, with everyone vying for them to become the top draft pick. However, Robinson, the consensus top pick in 1987, didn't follow this standard path. He only had one year of high school basketball experience, didn't attend any basketball camps, and when he entered college, he was only 6'6" and 175 pounds. He attended the Naval Academy, and his dream was to become a naval officer; professional basketball was never on his list of aspirations.

However, the height limit for admission to the Naval Academy was 6'6", and Robinson grew seven inches after enrolling. Suddenly, he became the center of attention. His height increased, but his coordination and speed remained outstanding. On the court, he was faster and taller than anyone else. "I didn't even notice how fast I was growing," said the 7'1" Robinson. "I just noticed more and more people looking at me and saying, 'Man, you have to play basketball!'" About 5% of Naval Academy students continue to grow to 6'8" after enrollment, but even with that height, it was still not enough to establish a foothold in Division I college basketball. Moreover, the Naval Academy was not primarily a basketball school, and no player had been selected to the All-American team since 1933.

However, having a 7-foot giant at the Naval Academy allowed the team, under Robinson's leadership, to become a powerhouse in the NCAA. They not only made it back to the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16 for the first time since 1960 but also reached the Elite Eight, setting a new record for the team. Robinson also grew into a super beast, receiving many invitations from colleges to transfer and becoming the coveted future top draft pick for NBA teams. Getting a million-dollar contract in the professional league was not a problem. However, being at the Naval Academy raised questions about Robinson's basketball career. When asked if Robinson had any flaws, Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) general manager Bob Ferry bluntly said, "Yes, his flaw is that he's in the Navy." Because Naval Academy graduates had to serve for five years, the discussion about whether Robinson should transfer to another basketball powerhouse to resolve his military service issue became the headline of newspapers and magazines at the time. However, Robinson's father was a loyal Navy man, which led Robinson to decide to stay at the Naval Academy, effectively cutting off his NBA path, causing a major controversy.

However, the Naval Academy's high-ranking officials found a win-win solution. After all, having Robinson stay not only proved the loyalty of Naval Academy graduates but also made Robinson a ready-made advertising face for the military. However, being 7 feet tall still posed limitations for certain submarine missions, so the Navy willingly adjusted Robinson's service period to two years, creating a situation that pleased everyone.

Robinson could remain loyal, and the NBA could gain a future generation of centers.

For the struggling Spurs at the time, both in terms of on-court performance and off-court ticket sales, having the lottery pick to choose Robinson was a godsend.

Robinson not only played the crucial position of center in the NBA but also excelled off the court. He scored 1320 on his SAT, majored in mathematics at the Naval Academy, and was skilled in music and computers. Apart from basketball, he had dabbled in gymnastics, bowling, golf, taekwondo, and tennis, and he was known for his humility and openness.
