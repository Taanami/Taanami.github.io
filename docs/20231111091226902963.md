In the 2223 season, the surprising player of the Flying Apes team has always been Guan Dayou. In his first season as a rookie, he stood out from the bench and even started for a while.

In the second season, Guan Dayou returned to the bench but gained the coach's trust in the middle of the season.

However, after Coach Caminos joined the team, Guan Dayou's playing time and number of appearances hit an all-time low.

Even though he remained healthy throughout the season, his average playing time dropped to only 10 minutes. This time, Guan Dayou did not have the same comeback as before. It was obvious that under Coach Caminos' system, Guan Dayou often received blame and this continued for the entire season.

This also presented the biggest challenge for Guan Dayou since he entered the professional league. Even during the middle of the season, Guan Dayou expressed on social media his desire to play. Is Guan Dayou not training diligently? Based on his past seasons where he fought for playing time from the bench, he definitely has the ability, but is his value what Coach Caminos is looking for? After Coach Caminos joined the team, the Flying Apes emphasized stability and reduced their fast break ratio, which removed the open style of play that Guan Dayou relied on. Once the pace slowed down and entered half-court play, the offense became heavily reliant on individual one-on-one skills and reading the game, which are not Guan Dayou's strengths. Since the team changed their style and direction, Guan Dayou has struggled to adapt.

In the cross-league invitation tournament, once Guan Dayou's engine starts, he can leave most defenders behind.

Just in terms of explosiveness and speed, Guan Dayou clearly has the level of a professional player, but the question is how he can utilize his skills.

Please continue reading below. Although struggling to adapt is related to the new direction of the Flying Apes, the author believes that playing half-court basketball is a natural thing, even if Guan Dayou goes to a team that plays an open style, he will thrive.

When the game becomes tense, there will always be a need to play half-court basketball. The author believes that this is a turning point in Guan Dayou's career. If he can understand the art of half-court offense and combine it with his physical and active defense, his value will definitely rise. How to adapt to the battlefield of half-court basketball will be the biggest challenge for Guan Dayou in his fourth season.

This is not an easy skill to master and it's not something that can be learned by practicing alone. Please continue reading below for the analysis of the team's style this season.

Even though it was known at the beginning of the season that the Flying Apes were lacking in point guards, Coach Caminos did not immediately promote Guan Dayou, who had often served as a backup point guard in the past. Instead, he let Shi Jinyao take over Wu Jiajun's position. It wasn't until the second half of the season that Guan Dayou started getting more playing time and became the point guard.

However, Guan Dayou still lacks the ability to read the defense and often gets his timing off despite his explosiveness. Therefore, the main reason Coach Caminos lets Guan Dayou play is for his defensive skills.

This task is not unfamiliar to Guan Dayou, as it was also highly valued by the Flying Apes in the third season.

However, there are many defensive aces on the Flying Apes team, and Guan Dayou is not Coach Caminos' first choice. When there are important defensive tasks, Coach Caminos still relies on Huang Honghan, Shi Jinyao, and Chen Yurui, or even the newly activated Li Jiakang in the second half of the season.

Although Guan Dayou has excellent individual defensive skills and natural talent, the author believes that his performance in team defense this season is not that great (refer to the animation below). On the offensive end, Guan Dayou is still the familiar and sharp fast break arrow, but in the Flying Apes, this skill set seems to be gathering dust. As mentioned earlier, the Flying Apes have tried playing fast break at one point, and during that time, Guan Dayou's performance was outstanding and even scored 15 points in a single game.

If we only look at his performance on the court, it seems that Guan Dayou's progress this year is relatively small and we haven't seen many new skills.

In fact, Guan Dayou has had more turnovers than steady improvements in his three years. In his first season, he had a turnover every 1.3 assists.

In the second season, it improved to 1.6 times, and in the third season, it reached 2.0 times, and this was even with his playing time cut in half from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. This may be related to his role, as he played less as a point guard this season and his possession time may have decreased.

But regardless, the improvement in assist-turnover ratio is something that the Flying Apes are happy about, as the team did a good job controlling turnovers last season.

Lastly, let's summarize Guan Dayou's performance this season with the animation below. This play is a successful elevator door tactic executed by Guan Dayou, and Dreamer didn't guard his man properly. The position and pace that Guan Dayou created were comfortable, and he made a quick pass for Zhang Zhenya to score. This was the Flying Apes' first offensive play in the second quarter of a certain game. Behind this successful tactic, it may have been Coach Caminos' command. Also, the reason this elevator door tactic was successful was that the defender guarding Zhang Zhenya was not focused enough at that moment, it was not because of Guan Dayou's actions. On the court, it still felt like a training drill. The author believes that the paint was empty at that moment, and the defender was too relaxed. With his superior physical and explosive abilities compared to Wu Jiajun, Guan Dayou could have tried to disrupt the defender's focus by making a cut. This season, we have seen Guan Dayou complete his point guard duties successfully a few times, but there are still many areas where he can improve his tactical thinking and observation of defenders.
