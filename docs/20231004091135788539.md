 NBA compromised, Harden will go to 76ers training camp. Beverley is excited about this.

According to ESPN reporter, James Harden, a player for the 76ers, did not attend the team's training at Colorado State University. He was still in Houston, but it is expected that he will arrive in Colorado today to join the training camp.

Harden did not participate in the team's media day yesterday. Multiple sources revealed that Harden is expected to continue pressuring the team, as he is still dissatisfied with the team's failure to trade him to the Clippers.

ESPN reporter Tim Bontemps revealed some news related to Harden in an interview.

Harden exercised his $36.5 million contract option in June and hoped that the team would trade him before the training camp.

However, the 76ers have not taken any action and hope that Harden can return and fight alongside them. According to sources, Harden has already received 50% of his salary for the new season, including 25% received on July 1.

Sources also revealed that during a previous investigation conducted in cooperation with the NBA, Harden stated that he would fulfill his contractual obligations with the 76ers if no trade is made.

Today, new 76ers recruit Patrick Beverley was interviewed during the training camp and talked about the possibility of Harden returning. "Very excited. As I've always said, it's very difficult to replace or find a player similar to James Harden, so of course. We are building chemistry here, and we welcome him with open arms." "Obviously, things related to players and management are beyond our control, but as teammates, we can't wait to see him."

During media day yesterday, longtime teammate PJ Tucker commented on Harden's absence, saying, "My relationship with him goes far beyond basketball, and I support him no matter where he goes." When asked if Harden will eventually join the 76ers, Tucker said, "I don't know, but I know he is firm in his feelings." Both Tucker and Beverley have been teammates with Harden on the Rockets.
