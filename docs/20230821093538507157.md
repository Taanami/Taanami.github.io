 Terror balance with a heavy head and light feet, three problems to watch in the recent Sun's trading of Bol Bol for Cam Payne and collecting second-round picks.

The Suns have been one of the most active teams during the offseason, making headlines with the Bradley Beal trade rumors. After the start of the free agency period, they have also signed Drew Eubanks, Keita Bates-Diop (KBD), Chimezie Metu, Yuta Watanabe, and Eric Gordon. They have also reached contract extensions with Josh Okogie and Damion Lee.

With their roster taking shape for the new season, the Suns have been making adjustments through signings and trades. First, they sent backup point guard Cam Payne along with a second-round pick to the Spurs in exchange for a protected future second-round pick. They then acquired 23-year-old forward Bol Bol, who was recently waived by the Magic, in a trade involving draft picks.

Bol Bol, like Eubanks, KBD, Metu, and Watanabe, can play multiple positions in the frontcourt. However, he stands out with his unique physical attributes. Standing at 7'2" (218cm) with a wingspan of 7'8" (234cm), Bol possesses a versatile skill set similar to this year's top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama (7'4" tall with a 7'10" wingspan). This has earned him the nickname "Original Wembanyama."

Last season, Bol had his best performance since entering the league four years ago. In 70 games played, he averaged 9.1 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game, all career highs. However, his performance fluctuated throughout the season.

In the first two and a half months of the season, Bol played 37 games, starting in 32 of them and averaging 26.1 minutes per game. He contributed an average of 12.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, and shot 58.8% from the field. But as the Magic's injured players Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, and Jalen Suggs returned in 2023, Bol's playing time and production decreased. In the next 33 games, he only started in one game and averaged 10 minutes less on the court, resulting in 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds per game.

The most significant impact of the inconsistent playing time was seen in Bol's three-point shooting. In the first two and a half months, he had a catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage of 38.1%. However, in 2023, it dropped to a dismal 8.6%.

Despite this, Bol remains a unique player when looking at advanced statistics. His height and smooth shooting touch make him difficult to stop on cuts to the basket, ranking him in the top 5% in efficiency. His height and wingspan also give him an advantage in offensive rebounding, with a top 5% efficiency in putbacks.

Bol's excellent ball-handling skills allow him to drive the ball on his own during fast breaks, making decisions based on the defense's positioning. He can either take it to the rim or make a quick stop-and-pop three-pointer. His transition offense accounted for 27.6% of his overall offensive contributions last season, ranking him 15th in the league, higher than any other Suns player.

Unlike most big men who act as screeners in pick-and-roll situations, Bol, with his versatile ball-handling skills, can also act as the ball handler. In today's positionless basketball trend, where big men handle the ball and forwards and guards can play multiple positions, Bol stands out as the number one among 7' tall players in pick-and-roll ball handling, accounting for 8.6% of his overall offensive contributions.

In summary, Bol Bol's all-around abilities in shooting, cutting, and passing make him a valuable piece in the coach's tactical adjustments on the offensive end. However, his impact on defense may not be as significant due to his thin frame despite his towering height. Within 6 feet of the rim, opponents' shooting percentage actually increases by 1.1% when defended by Bol, ranking him seventh from the bottom among all 7' tall players in the league last season.
