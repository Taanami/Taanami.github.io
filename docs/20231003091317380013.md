 NBA star Carmelo Anthony, also known as "Melon," announced his retirement from basketball in a heartfelt video on Twitter. After 19 seasons in the league, Anthony, who will turn 39 next week, decided to hang up his sneakers. Throughout his career, he played for the Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Los Angeles Lakers. With a total of 28,289 points, he ranks 9th on the NBA's all-time scoring list. 

Anthony, a 10-time NBA All-Star and 6-time All-NBA selection, expressed his gratitude for the game and the pride it brought him. Although he played for the Lakers in the 2021-22 season, he did not record any playing time in the current season (2022-23).

Despite not winning an NBA championship, Anthony's accomplishments are well-established. He was selected as one of the NBA's 75 greatest players and had a successful career, but the elusive championship ring remained out of reach. He led the Nuggets to the Western Conference Finals in 2009 but fell short against the eventual champions, the Lakers.

However, Anthony achieved great success representing the United States in the Olympics, winning gold medals in 2008, 2012, and 2016. He also played in a total of 31 Olympic games, the most by any American male basketball player. 

Drafted by the Nuggets as the third overall pick in the highly regarded 2003 NBA Draft, Anthony was part of a talented class that included LeBron James, Chris Bosh, and Dwyane Wade. Among them, Anthony is the only one who did not win an NBA championship. His prime years were with the Nuggets and Knicks, but his teams couldn't achieve the expected results due to his offensive-minded style of play. As injuries and age took a toll on his performance, his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game since joining the Thunder in the 2017-18 season, breaking his streak of 14 consecutive seasons with over 20 points per game. In his final season with the Lakers, he averaged a career-low 13.3 points per game.

On October 24, 2021, Anthony surpassed Moses Malone on the all-time scoring list, securing the 9th spot. After retirement, Anthony plans to focus on his son Kiyan, who is currently a highly regarded shooting guard in high school. Kiyan intends to attend Syracuse University, his father's alma mater, and hopes to follow in his footsteps and eventually make it to the NBA.
