The FIBA World Cup quarter-finals continued on the second day, with undefeated Germany facing the dark horse of the tournament, Latvia. Germany's key player, Franz Wagner, returned to the court after missing four consecutive games. However, Dennis Schroder had a poor performance, shooting only 4 out of 26. Fortunately, Germany had a comfortable lead in the fourth quarter and managed to win 81-79, setting up a semi-final match against the United States on Friday.

In the first quarter, Latvia started strong, taking advantage of Germany's offensive struggles and going on a 13-3 run, with Davis Bertans hitting three 3-pointers. However, Germany quickly adjusted their defense and players like Voigtmann and Franz Wagner made crucial 3-pointers. Maodo Lo and Andreas Obst stepped up to stabilize Germany's offense, as Schroder struggled in the first half, shooting 0 for 9. Germany had a slight lead of 36-34 at halftime. 

Both teams found their rhythm in the third quarter, with higher scoring compared to the previous two quarters. Schroder finally made his 13th shot, and Franz Wagner played more decisively, contributing to Germany's score. Latvia relied on Arturs Zagars to initiate their offense, with Bertans continuing to have a hot hand, making two more 3-pointers.

In the final quarter, Germany decided to bench Schroder and increase their height advantage by having Franz Wagner take on the role of point guard. They started the quarter with an 8-0 run, opening up an 11-point lead. However, Latvia managed to narrow the gap with two 3-pointers in the middle of the quarter, and Schroder, who had struggled throughout the game, finally started scoring. The score difference came down to ten points.

In the crucial last two minutes of the game, Rodions Kurucs made a 3-pointer, followed by a successful block from Bertans, and Zagars scored six consecutive points with difficult layups, bringing the deficit down to two points.

In the final seconds, Daniel Theis made two free throws for Germany, and Schroder attempted a drive but was blocked. Bertans had a chance to make a 3-pointer and turn the game around, but unfortunately missed. Germany secured an 81-79 victory and will face the United States on Friday for a spot in the finals.
