 Introduction to Bundang Business High School, the Empress of Korean High School Women's Basketball

This year, the Changyao Cup is being held in the form of an international invitational tournament. Among the international teams, Bundang Business High School from South Korea, also known as the "Empress of Korean High School Women's Basketball," has been announced as one of the prominent teams. Not only has this school established a dynasty in the Korean high school basketball scene, but it has also played a significant role in the professional development of women's basketball in Korea and the nurturing of national team players.

Despite its relatively short history, Bundang Business High School women's basketball team quickly rose to become one of the powerhouses in Korean women's basketball. Since its establishment in December 2007, the team has achieved remarkable success. They won third place in the 2010 National Federation Chairman's Basketball Championship and a silver medal in the 92nd National Sports Festival in 2011. In the following years, from 2014 to 2015, they swept all major competitions in the national high school women's division, winning numerous gold medals. Currently, they maintain an unbeaten record in the KSSBF Korean Middle and High School Basketball League for three consecutive years. This year, the team aims to achieve a three-peat in the national competitions.

As a rising star in Korean high school women's basketball, Bundang Business High School has produced numerous national team players and professional basketball talents in the past decade. One of the most well-known players is Park Ji-soo, who earned the titles of "Korea's Greatest Center of All Time" and "Basketball Prodigy." She became the youngest (16 years old) female national team player in Korean history and was selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the 5th overall pick in the 2018 WNBA Draft. Park Ji-soo is the second Korean player to enter the WNBA after Jung Sun-min, who played for the Seattle Storm in 2003. Additionally, key players such as Byun Soo-jung, Ko Na-yeon, and Park Soo-hee, who led the Korean team to the Round of 16 in the 2021 U19 World Cup, also hail from Bundang Business High School. Byun Soo-jung and Park Soo-hee were even selected as the second and third overall picks in the previous season's WKBL draft, earning them the nickname "Monster Rookies." Park Ji-soo, who emerged from Bundang Business High School, is considered one of the most promising female basketball players in recent years.

In the first half of this year, Bundang Business High School women's basketball team achieved a three-peat in national tournaments, winning the 60th Spring National High School Basketball Federation Championship, the 48th Association Chairman Ki Middle School Basketball Championship, and the 2023 King of Kings Weekend Basketball League. The active players who have secured their spots in this year's Changyao Cup include Seo You-jung, Park Do-won, and Byun Heo-jung, who was named the FMVP of the King of Kings tournament. These players are highly regarded in the development of Korean high school women's basketball and have recently announced their participation in the 2023-24 WKBL draft, becoming the latest focus of the national basketball scene.

Despite being a highly influential high school team in Korea, Bundang Business High School faces the challenge of achieving better results on the international stage. This is an issue that cannot be ignored at various levels of Korean basketball. However, as one of the five international high schools invited to participate in the Changyao Cup, the coaching staff of Bundang Business High School sees this as an important opportunity. They hope to not only share and showcase their championship-winning skills and abilities with their international counterparts but also foster the development of the team through cultural exchanges. Additionally, they aim to provide their players with more international experience, which will contribute to their personal growth and future careers. The participation of Bundang Business High School women's basketball team in the 10th Changyao Cup (pictured above) is eagerly anticipated.
