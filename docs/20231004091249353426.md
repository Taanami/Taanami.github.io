  Curry's Three-Point Record May Be Threatened by Buddy Hield's Potential Long-Term Threat

Two years ago, Stephen Curry surpassed Ray Allen with a career three-point shooting percentage of 42.8%, breaking the NBA's personal three-point shooting record and cementing himself as the greatest shooter in NBA history.

As we approach the 2023-24 season, Curry continues to maintain a high level of performance, currently with 3,390 career three-pointers, poised to further stack up the record.

Given Curry's current form and style of play, there is a strong possibility that he could play well into his 40s. If Curry does play for such a long time, there is a good chance that his career three-point total could surpass 4,000.

However, interestingly, there is a player currently in the league quietly chasing this Hall of Fame-level superstar shooter, and his name is not a household name in the NBA, nor is he a player that casual fans would immediately think of as a star player.

That's right, it's not James Harden. Although Harden, currently ranked third, has a chance this season to move up to second in the all-time three-pointers list, his career three-point shooting percentage of 36.3% and his age of 34 make it difficult for him to catch up. It's also not Luka Doncic. He may have a chance to surpass 3,000 career three-pointers, but to reach the 4,000 level, his current career three-point shooting percentage of 33.8% needs to improve to another level.

Some might guess Damian Lillard and Paul George, both known for their elite shooting accuracy. Currently ranked 10th and 26th, respectively, they have a chance to reach the top five in NBA history. However, like Harden, they are both 33 years old and already in the later stages of their prime, making it difficult for them to catch up to Curry.

Many might guess Klay Thompson, Curry's teammate currently ranked 18th in the three-pointers leaderboard. Thompson indeed had a chance, but two major injuries significantly slowed down his progress. If it weren't for those two major injuries, he might have already surpassed 2,300 three-pointers and secured the sixth spot while still in his prime. However, Thompson is also reaching the age of 34, making it equally challenging for him to keep up with Curry's pace. Please continue reading. So, who is the most likely candidate? You read it right, it's Buddy Hield.

Since the 2017-18 season, no player, including Curry, has made more three-pointers than Hield's 1,557. In the past five seasons, Hield has averaged 276 three-pointers made per season. If he can maintain the same level in the 2023-24 season, he will move up from 29th to 17th in the all-time list. If he can maintain it for another season, he will surpass Dirk Nowitzki and become 16th. If he can make a few more and reach 284, he will surpass Jason Kidd and become 15th. In the 2022-23 season, Hield made 288 three-pointers, second only to Thompson's 301.

Hield is currently 30 years old and has played at least 70 games in each of the past six seasons. He played 80 games in four seasons and missed only three games in the past two seasons.

Please continue reading. Let's assume Hield and Curry can both play until they are 40 years old. That means Curry has about five more seasons, while Hield has 10. Hield's average three-pointers per season have already surpassed Curry's (around 243). If Hield can maintain an average of 276 three-pointers per season until he is 40, his career total will be close to 4,500. If Curry can maintain a season average of 300 three-pointers for the next five years, he will accumulate around 4,890 three-pointers by the time he's 40, which is still far more than Hield. However, this is an overly optimistic assumption, as Curry's injuries and declining skills will undoubtedly have an impact. As long as Hield can have a few breakout seasons in the coming years, he may have a chance to get closer to, or even challenge, Curry's record. Nevertheless, it remains extremely difficult for Hield to surpass Curry's record due to the significant gap in shooting consistency between them. Throughout Hield's nine-year career, he has only had four seasons with a three-point shooting percentage above 40%. In contrast, Curry, excluding his injury-plagued 2019-20 season, has only had one season with a three-point shooting percentage below 40%.

But based on his current accumulation and form, Hield is the most likely contender. He still has several good years ahead of him, and most importantly, he is very healthy and plays a style of basketball that is less prone to injury. As long as he is willing, he will definitely have playing opportunities in this era of three-point shooting. According to Synergy data from the 2022-23 season, Hield had a spot-up three-point shooting percentage of 45.8%, a pull-up three-point shooting percentage of 42%, a catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage of 41.5%, and a step-back three-point shooting percentage of 61.5%. His overall three-point shooting percentage was as high as 42.5%, with his left and right corner three-point shooting percentages reaching 51.1% and 45.7%, respectively.
