New Taipei Kings announced today (9/8) that they have signed power forward Billy Preston, a former five-star high school player from the United States, as their third foreign player in the Jingtai Army. The team hopes that the young and experienced player Billy can contribute to both offense and defense.

Billy, from California, is 25 years old and stands at 208cm tall. During his student years, he was selected as a five-star high school player and received recruitment offers from prestigious NCAA schools, including the University of Kansas. His remarkable athleticism is his signature, and he also possesses excellent shooting skills from the perimeter. His exceptional ability to drive often creates scoring opportunities. Although he was not highly regarded in the 2018 NBA Draft, he later represented the Cleveland Cavaliers in the summer league and signed a two-way contract with their G League team, the Cleveland Charge, thus starting his professional career. He then played in various professional leagues in other countries, most recently in the South African Basketball League for the Cape Town Tigers, averaging 16.6 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. Regarding Billy's joining, General Manager Mao Gaen said, "Billy can be considered a modern-day stretch four, with excellent athleticism and offensive disruption skills, being able to slash and shoot. His agility and height also provide strength to the Jingtai Army's defense. At only 25 years old, he is still a young player with immense potential. We are very excited to see his combination with Mullen and Manny in the upcoming season, and we believe it will bring more flexibility to the Kings in terms of lineup adjustments and help the team achieve better results."
