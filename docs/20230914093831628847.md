 PLG Season 4 Pre-Analysis - Taipei Fubon Warriors

In the previous season, the Taipei Fubon Warriors experienced ups and downs in the first half but managed to secure the championship after the return of their veteran players in the second half, achieving a three-peat in the PLG league. This season, the Warriors have once again recruited several talented players with the goal of winning a fourth consecutive championship.

The Stability of the Veterans: As the saying goes, having an experienced player is like having a treasure. The Fubon Warriors have at least three veteran players who continue to perform at a high level.

Lin Chih-chieh, known as "The Beast," is an unstoppable force and has proven himself to be the top player in Taiwanese basketball with his outstanding performance in the playoffs.

Jet Chang's sharp breakthroughs, excellent finishes, and consistent performance demonstrate his ability to dominate games. Veteran Tsai Wen-cheng efficiently contributes points and has even delivered game-winning shots.

With these three players on the team, the Warriors stand undefeated. The Rise of the Mid-generation Players: In the previous season, we witnessed the impressive performances of mid-generation players like Chang Wen-ping and Hsieh Tsung-jung, who often played the role of surprise contributors, helping the team secure crucial victories. Chang Wen-ping's memorable three-point shot in the championship series helped the Warriors secure a critical win. Hsieh Tsung-jung's performance in the paint was also remarkable, and if they continue to seize playing time this season, they have the potential to perform even better and contribute to the team's success. The Emergence of the Rookies: The Warriors' most anticipated aspect is the rise of their young players. Players like Chien Ting-chao, Hung Kai-chieh, and Chen Fan-bo-yen have all shown impressive performances while playing for the Chinese Taipei White Team. Chien Ting-chao and Hung Kai-chieh, as the team's first and second options, impressed in the Jones Cup, particularly with Chien Ting-chao's control of the game's pace and Hung Kai-chieh's drives to the basket. Chen Fan-bo-yen's performance deserves special mention. Despite initially being on the bench, he earned the coaching staff's recognition with his precise three-point shooting and solid defense, leading to his promotion to the starting lineup. Chen Fan-bo-yen's exceptional talent, showcased in last year's physical fitness test, will undoubtedly make him a key player for the Warriors in the future.

Additionally, the inclusion of Zhou Gui-yu and Tseng Hsiang-chun in the Chinese Taipei Blue Team is a testament to their impressive performances last year. Tseng Hsiang-chun, a 205cm local center with three-point shooting ability and good lateral movement, earned his spot in the national team through his skills. Zhou Gui-yu's outstanding defense against Manny Harris in the finals amazed fans, and he rightfully secured a place in the Chinese Taipei Blue Team's 18-man roster. Zhou Gui-yu's evident improvement in shooting accuracy, defensive pressure, and ability to score after driving to the basket demonstrates his potential. With more playing time next season, he will fully showcase his skills.

The Torch Continues: The torch of the Fubon Warriors' legacy seems to have smoothly passed to the young players' hands.

Continued Contracts with Foreign Players: The Warriors have re-signed all three of their foreign players for this season. It is well-known that these players possess exceptional skills, and their excellent teamwork sets them apart from foreign players on other teams. This is the Warriors' greatest advantage. For example, in the semi-finals against the Yulon Luxgens, Xavier Alexander played a crucial role. In the championship series against the Formosa Dreamers, coach Xu Zhin-jiun chose to pair Marcus Keene with Charles Garcia, which ultimately led to their championship victory. This proves that these three foreign players have excellent compatibility with the team and are indispensable for the Warriors' championship aspirations.

Off-season Strengthening: During the off-season, the Warriors made several additions to their roster. They selected Tsai Chen-yueh, a 197cm power forward, in the draft. Tsai possesses excellent physical qualities. They also signed a new foreign player, Shi Men, whose athletic abilities are evident from various videos. However, their most significant reinforcement came from the Dreamers, with the acquisition of Wu Yong-sheng, a point guard at the Chinese Taipei national team level. Wu's signing addresses the previous season's issue of relying on frontcourt players to handle the ball. With coach Xu's leadership, Wu Yong-sheng is expected to quickly integrate into the team and achieve excellent results.

The Best Head Coach: When talking about the Fubon Warriors, one cannot overlook their coach, Xu Jin-zhe, known as the best head coach in the world.

Coach Xu Jin-zhe's tactics and player management skills are top-notch. He possesses a keen understanding of the game and excellent personnel deployment. In the previous season's championship series, he perfectly demonstrated his coaching abilities. He utilized different players in different situations and ensured that they all performed well. This is the strength of Coach Xu Jin-zhe, the best head coach in the world.

The Only Concern: The only concern for the Fubon Warriors is injuries. It is undeniable that as players age, they become more prone to injuries. This is a common occurrence.

The Warriors may also face this issue. While their overall team strength is exceptional with almost no weaknesses, injuries are the only potential threat to their success. As long as the Fubon Warriors can protect their players from excessive fatigue and maintain their physical condition by rotating players, they have a great chance of winning a fourth consecutive championship.
