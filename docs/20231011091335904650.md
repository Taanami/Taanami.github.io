 Jeremy Lin, the former leader of the P. LEAGUE+ Kaohsiung Steel, made a surprising move by joining the PLG New Taipei Kings after their miraculous journey to the playoffs last season. Lin's decision to join the Kings was unexpected but not entirely surprising.

Many Taiwanese basketball teams, including his former team the Kaohsiung Steel and the T1 LEAGUE's Taipei Fubon Braves, had expressed interest in signing Lin since he became a free agent. However, it was always clear that the Kings had the upper hand, as they had the valuable asset of Lin's younger brother, Lin Shu-Wei.

It has always been Lin's dream to play alongside his brother, and even during their time in the SBL with the Taipei Fubon Braves, Lin expressed his openness to joining the league to team up with his brother. After joining the Kaohsiung Steel earlier this year, Lin mentioned in interviews that he and his brother had always wanted to be teammates rather than opponents. However, they felt that last season was not the right time for them to play together, as Lin Shu-Wei was having a successful season with the Kings.

While there were rumors of Lin returning to the CBA, it seems that the limitations of the league's foreign player system and the physicality of the game were deterrents for him. The CBA's "four quarters, four foreign players" rule restricted his playing time and role in the past two seasons, even leading to his marginalization during his time with the Guangzhou Loong Lions last season.

In contrast, playing in Taiwan allows Lin to fulfill his dream of playing basketball with his brother and offers incentives that the CBA cannot provide. Despite the physicality of the PLG, Lin's presence will undoubtedly benefit the Kings, as he has consistently shown his prowess on both ends of the court.

Last season, Lin averaged 26.32 points, 8.47 rebounds, 8.89 assists, 1.84 steals, and 0.53 blocks per game, ranking first in scoring and assists, second in steals, and among the top guards in rebounds and blocks. He also set several milestones in the PLG, including a career-high 50 points in a single game, the highest-scoring half (32 points), and two games with the most assists (15 and 16). With a more complete roster in the Kings, Lin's performance is expected to reach new heights.

Looking at the Kings' frontcourt, pairing Lin with a capable big man will be beneficial, as seen in his previous collaborations with Ekpe Udoh and Justin Hamilton in Beijing. Last season, the addition of Wendell Lewis, who had better physicality and competitiveness than Viacheslav Kravtsov, also contributed to Lin's improved performance with the Kaohsiung Steel.

The Kings currently have several talented big men, including Tony Mitchell, who can attack the rim, Billy Preston as a stretch four, and Byron Mullens and Quincy Davis III, who possess all-around offensive abilities. With Lin's expertise in the pick-and-roll game, the Kings should be able to increase their tactical flexibility in the upcoming season.
