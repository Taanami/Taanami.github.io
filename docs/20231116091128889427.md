#  從進攻端來說，Chet擁有不錯的外圍觸角，不時的幫助雷霆打開外線空檔，或是自己拉出來幹掉對方中鋒，但最重要的是，Chet在禁區內的一手包夾也不遑多讓，有時他還會在左右兩側輪流包夾一名低位的大個子，讓對方在接到球後就陷入苦戰，防守效率更是排在全聯盟最佳的前五名。

 雖然一開季就傷兵滿營，但隨著Jaylin Williams和Kenrich Williams的快速回復，還有Olivier Sarr的進步，雷霆在內線的補強也算合格，除了Jaylin Williams外，Kenrich Williams和Olivier Sarr都可以在比賽中展現出不錯的實力。

 雷霆在這週的表現讓人眼前一亮，尤其是年輕球員們的成長和表現，讓球隊未來的前景更加光明。雖然有些挑戰，但隨著傷兵的回復和球員的成長，我們相信雷霆將會在這個賽季取得更多的勝利！

The Oklahoma City Thunder, who are still good at playing on the road, had a tough start to the 2023-24 season with injuries to key players Kenrich Williams and Jaylin Williams. With only Chet Holmgren and two-way player Olivier Sarr left as centers, the team had to face the opening games of the season. However, the Thunder performed well in the first week of the season, defeating the Chicago Bulls on the road and then the Cleveland Cavaliers in a comeback win with an 18-5 run in the last 2 minutes and 40 seconds.

In their home opener, they faced the defending champions Denver Nuggets and suffered a 33-point loss. However, they quickly bounced back and defeated the Detroit Pistons the next day, ending the week with a 3-1 record.

In the first game against the Bulls, both teams had a close battle in the first three quarters, with the Bulls trailing by only one point with 3 minutes left in the third quarter. However, the Thunder's guards were able to break through the Bulls' defense and hit a series of three-pointers in the fourth quarter, securing the opening game victory.

In the next game against the Cavaliers, who were missing Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen, the Thunder faced a tough defensive battle. Both teams had strong defenders inside and outside, resulting in a low-scoring game. Donovan Mitchell of the Cavaliers tried to attack the Thunder's defense by using screens, but the Thunder's defense held strong, with Luguentz Dort and Chet Holmgren making key plays to secure the win.

After two consecutive wins on the road, the Thunder returned home to face the Denver Nuggets, but unfortunately suffered a big defeat with poor shooting from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the team's perimeter players. However, they quickly regrouped and defeated the Detroit Pistons the next day with strong defense from Dort and Holmgren, limiting the impact of Cade Cunningham and Jalen Duren. This was also the only game where Holmgren played all three quarters.

Despite the injuries and setbacks, the Thunder's young players showed great potential and growth in the first week of the season. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, known for his strong performances on the road, led the team with an average of 65 points, 16 rebounds, and 6 steals in the first two games. He also showcased improved passing skills, making beautiful skip passes to open teammates. However, he will need to work on his free throw shooting, with only 11 attempts in the first three games.

As for Chet Holmgren, despite a tough first game against Nikola Vucevic and Andre Drummond, he quickly proved himself to be a perfect fit for the Thunder's system with his defense and offensive versatility. He also helped create open looks for his teammates and was a force inside the paint. Despite not having the same level of physicality as other centers, Holmgren's length and defensive awareness allowed him to block shots and rank in the top five in the league in defensive efficiency.

Although the Thunder had a lot of injuries to start the season, the return of Jaylin Williams and Kenrich Williams, as well as the improvement of Olivier Sarr, have strengthened the team's frontcourt. And with the young players' growth and potential, the Thunder have a bright future ahead. Despite the challenges, we believe that the Thunder will continue to improve and achieve more victories this season.
