With the addition of Damian Lillard, the Milwaukee Bucks' roster is now even more formidable. However, the real challenge lies in how they can integrate Lillard into head coach Adrian Griffin's system. According to the latest sports betting odds, the Bucks are the clear favorites to win the championship in the 2023-24 season. Lillard's arrival has definitely raised the stakes for the Bucks, as they now have two star players who can both score over 20 points per game, making them one of the most powerful duos in the NBA.

Offensively, the integration process should not be too difficult. Lillard's outside shooting and Antetokounmpo's inside presence will complement each other well. After playing together in their first preseason game, both players expressed how comfortable they felt playing with each other.

"When the opponent double teams me or sets traps, I have Giannis to pass to. It's just too easy," Lillard said after their first game against the Lakers. "It was the first time I felt so free on the court," Antetokounmpo added, as Lillard's elite shooting and scoring ability created more space for him to operate.

With a top-notch inside-outside combo, the Bucks will have a unique and powerful offensive attack. Compared to Jrue Holiday, Lillard brings a stronger individual offense and outside shooting, not only freeing up space for Antetokounmpo, but also creating more opportunities for Khris Middleton on the perimeter.

Last season, the Bucks ranked 7th in the league for the number of pick-and-rolls executed per game (16.7). They also did not have much off-ball movement or isolation plays. Lillard's ball-handling skills will be a perfect addition to the Bucks, who lacked this type of player. He can create opportunities in pick-and-roll situations and also create his own outside shot. This will allow Antetokounmpo and Middleton to focus on their strengths as finishers.

With his athleticism and height, Antetokounmpo will have more opportunities to cut to the basket when Lillard, a skilled playmaker and outside shooter, is on the court. Not to mention, his passing ability will also be a threat. Photo credit: Getty ImagesNext, let's talk about defense. In the past 5 seasons, the Bucks have ranked in the top 10 in defensive efficiency for 4 of those seasons.

In the 2022-23 season, when Holiday was the primary defender against opponents, the team's defensive efficiency ranked 4th in the league.

Although Lillard's defense is not on the same level as Holiday's, the Bucks are not too concerned, as they have two former Defensive Player of the Year candidates in Antetokounmpo and center Brook Lopez.

Another important change is that the Bucks have lost their veteran depth in recent seasons. While players like Jae Crowder, Pat Connaughton, and Bobby Portis are still on the team, Wes Matthews and Joe Ingles have left, and Grayson Allen was traded in the Lillard deal. New additions to the team include Malik Beasley and backup point guard Cameron Payne.

Beasley is expected to be a key reserve for the Bucks, as he has a career 3-point percentage of 37.8% and has averaged over 20 points per game in a single season. With above-average defense, the Bucks will need him to provide scoring off the bench. Please continue readingDespite some concerns, this roster revamp is highly anticipated. In 2020, the Bucks underwent major changes in order to win a championship. They traded away starting point guard Eric Bledsoe, who struggled with his shooting in the playoffs, for Holiday, a top-notch defender. Head coach Mike Budenholzer also adjusted the team's offensive strategy, focusing more on attacking the paint and being more aggressive in rebounding. At first, this new approach did not work well and the team even faced a 5-game losing streak, their worst in 4 years, with only 16 wins and 13 losses in 29 games.

"We all understand that things won't always go as planned," Middleton reflected on that season. "We knew we needed to use different strategies to win. That's what a successful team does: they are able to adapt their roster and strategies. Because in this highly competitive league, you can't stay the same."

In the end, the Bucks won their first championship in franchise history, ending a 50-year drought. In the 2023-24 season, the Bucks will face many challenges once again, but with Lillard on board, there will be more strategies and sparks. It will be up to new head coach Griffin to serve up the right dishes. While Griffin has expressed his desire for the team to play faster, he has not revealed much about his strategy, so it is unclear how much it will differ from Budenholzer's approach.

One thing is for sure: how the duo of Lillard and Antetokounmpo will work together will be the key to the Bucks' long journey in the playoffs. Both players are superstars in their own right, but whether they can be a deadly duo will determine if they can lead the Bucks to another championship.
