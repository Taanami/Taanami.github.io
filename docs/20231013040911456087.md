  2023 TGF Cup of Excellence in Firefighting Basketball Tournament Team Interview: We Have No Uniforms

One of the representatives for the senior division in the northern region is the team "We Have No Uniforms". In fact, the team is made up of players who have won the HBL Division 2 championship in the 106th, 108th, and 109th academic years. They come from traditional powerhouses such as Taitung High School, Xinhua Vocational High School, Huideng High School, and Kaohsiung Vocational High School. This year, they not only participated in the senior division, but also won third place in the 3-on-3 tournament. Moreover, the team's joyful atmosphere has created a bond among the players, making them like brothers on the court. From high school to university, we have witnessed their growth and transformation, and we look forward to seeing them on more basketball courts. Please continue reading below.

About the reunion of Dongzhong classmates, Xie Wenxiang said, "I am really happy. It's been a long time since we played together, but we still have a familiar feeling and it brings back memories of our past experiences. I miss it and cherish this opportunity." This year at the TGF Cup, Xie Wenxiang also served as the team's assist leader, making numerous spectacular passes. With his organization on the court, the team's rhythm became smoother. As a senior division team this year, team captain Xu Yuxuan said, "It's a different feeling to play with opponents from different places who have become teammates. It's quite fresh, and it feels like we're back in high school. We not only have high school teammates and opponents, but also university teammates. It's a special memory, and only the TGF Cup can bring us together to play."

The spiritual leader of the team, Wu Haoqun, can often be heard cheering on his teammates from the sidelines. He once told his teammates, "We all came here to play, but if we want to play happily, we must learn to share the ball." Seeing his determination on the court, we can understand that he wants to be on the court more than anyone else, but sharing is also part of the game. Sacrifice leads to gains, and this selfless team spirit is truly valuable. As a result, the team went far in the tournament, reaching the finals in the 5-on-5 tournament and winning third place in the 3-on-3 tournament. This was a fulfilling summer for them.

In addition, Zeng Yuhao also had a good performance at this year's TGF Cup. He once hit seven three-pointers in a single game in the northern region preliminaries. Although he may not be the team's main scorer, he always provides the necessary firepower when the team needs it, making him the team's best sixth man.

Xu Yongyang, who joined the team for the finals, also cherished this opportunity. He said, "My goal in participating in the TGF Cup is the same as the TGF team's, to uphold the spirit of inheritance and sustainability. Winning or losing is secondary in sports, and I value the teamwork and interaction on and off the court. Only through this can we truly understand the rewards that this game brings. I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this event with my classmates from National Taiwan Sport University this year. Everyone has selflessly contributed on the court, and although we only met for the first time, we have formed a strong bond. This experience has allowed me to fully experience the charm of basketball and get to know players from different places. I hope to form another team and play together happily next year!"

Having a team composed of multiple HBL Division 2 champions is a special combination. From opponents in the past to teammates now, they have come together because of basketball and have made more friends through basketball. This is the beauty of basketball. Moreover, they not only come to compete, but also help clean up the court and surrounding areas after the games or during breaks. This, I believe, is the essence of grassroots basketball, making basketball more than just a game.
