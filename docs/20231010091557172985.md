# Discussing the first offseason of the new NBA collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which came into effect on July 1st 
 Discussing the first offseason of the new NBA collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which came into effect on July 1st. With changes in game rules, the league's ecosystem and operations have undergone significant developments. Who benefited and who suffered from the new CBA? The end of the superteam era? As mentioned in my previous article at the end of June, with the implementation of the second apron (Super Tax), many powerhouse teams are unable to avoid salary cleansing, such as the Warriors trading Jordan Poole, the Clippers letting go of Eric Gordon, and the Hawks selling John Collins.

However, the Suns have shown a completely opposite approach, trading Wizards' star Bradley Beal before the new CBA took effect to maximize their cap space. This may be the last super team in the NBA for the foreseeable future. Under the new CBA, once a team's total salary exceeds the second apron, they cannot use the middle-class exception or sign-and-trade, and the flexibility of trade amounts will be limited. The future first-round draft picks will directly become the 30th pick, making the cost much heavier than luxury tax. It will be challenging to maintain a roster with three superstars (salary accounting for over 30%) in the long term. For example, the Suns' Kevin Durant and Beal will account for approximately 35% of the salary cap in the upcoming season, while Devin Booker will account for 26%. However, starting in the 2024-25 season, when the new contracts take effect, the three Suns stars will consume about 105% of the salary cap, which is an overflow situation.

Simply from a salary perspective, Deandre Ayton will likely become a contract that needs to be traded. I believe that the Suns cannot sustain a big three lineup for too long; they will have to show their true colors in the short term.

The next team facing salary crisis is the Timberwolves. They signed Anthony Edwards to a five-year, $259 million extension this summer, effective from the 2024-25 season. Combined with Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert's contracts, they will consume 90% of the salary cap. Unless the Timberwolves can quickly grow into a championship-contending team in the short term, they will face the consequences of the second apron.

The Clippers, whose salary has already exploded, need to make choices in the new season, accelerating the replacement of high-priced veteran players like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard to alleviate salary pressure.

This year and the next will be a transitional period, and powerhouse teams will need to slow down and adjust their rosters instead of relying on silver bullet strategies to strengthen their teams.

Teams like the Suns, Timberwolves, Warriors, or Clippers may find more suitable role players through trades, but it will be challenging to maintain the current salary cap for a long time. They will either have to trade high-salary players or face rebuilding. However, don't worry, I believe the resilient NBA executives will still be able to form super teams. However, if they fail to win championships, the consequences may be more painful than before.

The more flexible trading and signing exceptions of the new CBA will benefit teams with limited financial resources. Many trading restrictions have been relaxed, and more exceptions can be used as long as the total salary remains below the two aprons. The Cavaliers, for example, saved up to $7.5 million in price difference by completing a sign-and-trade for Max Strus (4 years, $63 million). Under the old rules, the Cavaliers would have had to offer a higher-priced contract to the Heat. The Rockets also benefited from this new rule when signing Dillon Brooks.

Second-round rookies now have their own special exceptions. Unlike first-round rookies with standardized contracts, second-round rookies used to have to use salary cap space or split middle-class exceptions to sign 3-4 year contracts. The new second-round exception solves this problem. The Kings used this exception to sign Colby Jones, the 34th pick, to a 4-year, $8.76 million contract, while the Hawks signed Mouhamed Gueye, the 39th pick, to a 4-year, $7.63 million contract with a team option in the final year. This is seen as a key move to avoid a repeat of the "Jalen Brunson situation," where teams had limited options when restricted free agents received offers.

In 2021, the Nuggets signed Michael Porter Jr. to a designated rookie extension of 5 years, $179.29 million, which caused some discussions. Previously, teams were limited to two designated players. With the new CBA, this limitation has been removed, and first-round rookies can sign 5-year contracts without any conditions. This allowed Desmond Bane of the Grizzlies to sign a 5-year, $197.23 million contract, slightly below the max contract of 25%. This shows that the NBA is encouraging the development of young players and giving more incentives and conditions for teams to keep their young players. Restricted free agents have a disadvantage in negotiating contracts. While they have the advantage of being able to match any offer from other teams, it weakens their bargaining power. The offering team usually needs to offer a slightly higher contract to discourage other teams from pursuing the player. This limits the restricted free agents' ability to secure the ideal contract value.

In terms of free agency, excluding re-signings, only four players, Max Strus, Bruce Brown Jr., Fred VanVleet, and Dillon Brooks, received new contracts exceeding the full mid-level exception. Among the 7-10 teams that can create tens of millions in cap space, only the Pacers and Rockets are willing to spend money.

Rather than focusing on large-scale experiments with cap space as in the past, many rebuilding teams have reaped rewards in this offseason, providing better development opportunities for young players and making the games more competitive.

It is worth noting that the new CBA requires teams to meet the salary floor threshold on the first day of the season; otherwise, they will not be eligible for luxury tax distribution. This has put pressure on teams to spend money in the offseason. While teams like the Pacers and Rockets have offered premium contracts, many rebuilding teams have filled their cap space through trades and invested in functional veteran players.

Unlike in the past, where teams preferred to keep cap space for big moves, many rebuilding teams have reaped benefits this year, giving young players more room to develop and making the games more exciting.
