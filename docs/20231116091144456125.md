 2023 TGF Firefighting World Cup Basketball Tournament Player Interview - Shengsheng Firefighting U Chen Hao and Wang Zhonghan

In the past two years, the key figures in Jianguo High School's consecutive victories in the second division were none other than Wang Zhonghan and Chen Hao. The two have been teammates for nearly ten years, from Sanxing Elementary School, Yongji Junior High School, to Jianguo High School. Their bond and understanding are as strong as blood. Now, they are about to officially go their separate ways in college. There may be some reluctance, but in the last summer of high school, they joined Shengsheng Firefighting and ultimately won the championship in the Central Region and the final. Not only did they win the league, but they also won the gold medal for Shengsheng Firefighting for two consecutive years, marking a perfect ending to their high school career.

Please continue reading - After winning the league two consecutive times this year, Chen Hao said: "Last year, I mainly played off the ball, but as a senior this year, I have to take on more responsibility. Actually, I didn't think about winning the championship at first, so there wasn't much pressure on us. It's possible that because we had no fear, we performed better. As for setbacks, it was dealing with the busy schedule of applying for college. I had very little time to practice, and my physical fitness is my weakness, so I have to adjust during the game."

Please continue reading - When they joined Shengsheng Firefighting, they said: "Being part of this big family, we feel very relaxed. Plus, our teammates are all talented players from different schools, so it's refreshing to mesh with them. It's more like a exchange than a competition."

Facing the decision of which university to attend, Wang Zhonghan said: "I have always planned to study abroad, and I chose a university in Germany because most of them don't have tuition fees, so the cost won't be too high compared to Taiwan. Technical University of Munich is also considered the best university in Germany, so I decided to major in Management & Technology."

Meanwhile, Chen Hao chose to study at Tsinghua University without specifying a major. He said: "By chance, I discovered this major at Tsinghua University. It can satisfy my desire to explore various fields in my freshman year, and I can choose a major that I'm interested in for my future studies. It's suitable for someone like me who's still unsure about what to choose."

After the TGF Firefighting World Cup ended, the two will embark on a new journey. They also hope their younger teammates will play freely, give their all, and aim for the ultimate goal without any regrets. Lastly, they send warm and playful wishes to each other, not saying goodbye, but until we meet again. They wish the two players all the best in their respective fields and hope to see them again in next year's TGF Firefighting World Cup.
