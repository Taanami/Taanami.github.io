  According to ESPN reporter Brian Windhorst, his sources have revealed that the Los Angeles Clippers have officially ended their trade talks for James Harden.

 It has been reported that the Clippers believe a trade for Harden will not happen and have decided to move on. Harden had requested a trade early in the offseason, but the Philadelphia 76ers asked for too much and many other teams also backed off. Harden even publicly called out former Rockets GM Daryl Morey during his trip to China, leading to a fine from the NBA. Windhorst said on his podcast, "They were close to a deal for Malcolm Brogdon and then that fell apart.

 They tried to trade for James Harden, but it didn't happen. From what I understand, the Clippers said, 'Well, we couldn't get a deal done, so we'll move on.'" Windhorst believes that this trade could potentially happen during the season, but until then, Russell Westbrook will likely be the starting point guard for the Clippers. If Harden refuses to report to training camp with the 76ers at the start of the new season, they can prevent him from becoming a free agent.
