# The 2023 NBA Draft took place at the Barclays Center in New York yesterday 
 The 2023 NBA Draft took place at the Barclays Center in New York yesterday. The top three picks had their own unique characteristics. Victor Wembanyama, known as the "French Monster," was expected to be the first overall pick and he fulfilled that expectation by being selected by the San Antonio Spurs. Standing at 7 feet 5 inches (226 cm) tall with an 8-foot wingspan (243 cm), Wembanyama possesses remarkable physical attributes. Not only that, he also has the shooting touch of a guard and the mobility of a forward, making him the clear favorite for the top pick for months.

Wembanyama becomes the third number one pick in Spurs' history, following in the footsteps of David Robinson in 1987 and Tim Duncan in 1997. These two great centers in Spurs' history have both helped the team win NBA championships.

Now, Wembanyama has the responsibility to continue the legacy. The Spurs have won the NBA championship five times in their history, with the most recent one coming in the 2013-14 season. With Wembanyama on board, the team has decided to extend the contract of their legendary 74-year-old coach, Gregg Popovich, for three more years. They hope to leverage his experience in coaching French stars like Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to help Wembanyama adapt quickly to the intensity and lifestyle of the NBA. Wembanyama couldn't hold back his tears after becoming the number one pick. In an interview with ESPN, he said, "When I heard the NBA commissioner call my name, it was like my lifelong dream coming true. I've had this dream many times, so that's why I cried."

Brandon Miller, the second overall pick, stands at 6 feet 9 inches (205 cm) with excellent 3D physical attributes. He is also the only player among the top three picks who has played in college in the United States. Although he was chosen by the Charlotte Hornets, ESPN reported that during his workout with the Hornets, he told the team owner, the basketball legend Michael Jordan, that he is not his idol and has rarely watched Jordan play. Miller's journey to becoming the second pick was full of twists and turns. A year ago, he was projected to be a second-round pick or even go undrafted. However, Miller improved his skills and played for the number one seed in the NCAA men's basketball tournament, the University of Alabama, which propelled him into the lottery conversation.

However, in February of this year, Miller was unexpectedly involved in a shooting incident with his college teammate. Although he was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, it nearly cost him his basketball career.

If it weren't for Wembanyama, Hyun-dae Han, who stands at only 188 cm but possesses explosive athleticism, would have had a good chance of being this year's top pick.

Han is praised for his excellent passing vision, outstanding physical condition, and leadership qualities on the court. Other than needing improvement in his three-point shooting, he has few weaknesses and is likely to become a highly regarded rookie in the league.

Han played in the development league this year, starting in all 19 games and averaging 16.5 points and 6.8 assists. However, his three-point shooting percentage is only 27.5%.

The Portland Trail Blazers' decision to select Han raises questions about whether they will initiate a trade involving their star player Damian Lillard or pair him with Han to form a backcourt duo. Only time will tell how this situation unfolds.
