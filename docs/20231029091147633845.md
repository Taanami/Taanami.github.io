 According to NBA reporter Shams Charania, there is a significant gap between the Golden State Warriors and star shooting guard Klay Thompson in their contract extension negotiations. Despite various signs indicating that Thompson will enter free agency next year, he stated on a live broadcast that this year will be the best of his career.

Shams revealed on the program that the negotiations between Thompson and the team have hit a bottleneck, mainly due to Thompson's camp requesting more in terms of contract length and salary. He also mentioned that the Warriors have had several experiences dealing with key players entering free agency in the past, such as Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Last year, Draymond was an example; the team considered extending his contract before the season, but ultimately waited until he entered free agency in July and reached a consensus on staying with the team.

Finally, Shams also stated that the Warriors are not unwilling to spend money on Thompson, but they also want to see how he performs this season before making a decision. He also mentioned that Thompson may be harboring some resentment towards the situation. After Shams released the clip of the program, Thompson also went live on Instagram, appearing very relaxed and playing Bob Marley's "Is This Love" in the background. He also said, "This is my 13th year in the league, and it will be my best year."
