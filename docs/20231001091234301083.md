 Trouble Nightmare Reappears in the 2023 World Cup: USA Powerless to Catch Up with Lithuania, Suffers First Defeat

The United States probably felt that the pit they dug in the first game of the second round against Montenegro in the 2023 World Cup was not deep enough. Josh Hart became a starter: the United States actively changed their lineup to continue their winning streak. In the game against Lithuania, they aimed to secure first place in Group J. However, in the first quarter, they dug an even deeper hole for themselves. Please continue reading.

Although Lithuania has a small population, they have always been a basketball powerhouse, with records of facing the United States in the Olympics and World Cups.

However, Lithuania missed the Olympics in their own country in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Due to groupings, they did not face the United States in the 2019 World Cup or the 2016 Rio Olympics. The last time these two teams met in a top international competition was in the 2014 World Cup. Lithuania's only victory against the United States was in the 2004 Athens Olympics, where legendary guard Sarunas Jasikevicius scored 28 points to lead the team to defeat the United States in the preliminary round.

In fact, Lithuania came close to making history in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. After a fierce battle in the semifinals, Jasikevicius missed a three-pointer in the final moments, resulting in a 2-point loss. They could not become the first team to defeat the entire NBA United States team. It wasn't until two years later at the World Championships that Argentine legend Manu Ginobili achieved this feat.

Both teams had maintained undefeated records before this match and had already secured their spots in the upcoming knockout stage. This game was more like a battle of momentum and dignity.

In this game, the absence of power forward Domantas Sabonis, due to injury, allowed Jonas Valančiūnas, the Pelicans' center, to play well. Valančiūnas is a heavyweight center, while Sabonis, although slightly smaller in size, has similar mobility. When they play together, they may dominate the rebounds against their opponents, but they suffer defensively. Offensively, Sabonis and Valančiūnas' outside shooting ability is not enough to create sufficient spacing. Even though Sabonis has excellent playmaking and passing skills from the high post, the lack of spacing makes it difficult to utilize their skills effectively on the FIBA court.

Without Sabonis playing in this game, the scene of two monks without water has disappeared, and they can return to the traditional style of setting screens and making cuts without the ball.

With Rokas Jokubaitis, the team's main point guard, and other smart players, as well as the explosive forward Ignas Brazdeikis, who can pass and cut repeatedly, Lithuania knows exactly what they are doing. They have a disciplined and well-coordinated team.

Lithuania had a clear and concise strategy for this game. They targeted the lack of competitiveness in the American backcourt and used a switching defense strategy to create mismatches. They took advantage of their superior competitiveness to frequently score in the low post. Starting point guard Jalen Brunson committed three fouls, and Austin Reaves, who had performed well in previous games, fouled out. The American guards were truly in trouble.

Luck can be said to be the best description of this game. Lithuania started the game by hitting nine consecutive three-pointers, completely pulling ahead. Less than a minute into the game, the United States briefly took a 4-2 lead, but then Lithuania launched a barrage of three-pointers and dominated the offensive rebounds throughout the game, with the United States constantly playing catch-up.

In the first quarter, starting center Jaren Jackson Jr. (JJJ) committed two fouls, and in the second quarter, he committed another foul, totaling three fouls in the first half. He fouled out again, leaving the United States without their most powerful presence in the paint. Facing Lithuania's three-point barrage, the United States needed a center who could defend the perimeter, but JJJ, who was best suited for this role, could only sit on the sidelines and watch due to fouls. The United States fell behind by 19 points in the first quarter, and although they narrowed the gap at one point in the second quarter, they quickly fell behind again, ending the first half 17 points behind and in a dangerous situation.

In the past, when the situation was critical for the United States, they usually relied on their physicality and depth to make a comeback in the second half. However, Lithuania had many capable players at their disposal. With a rotation of 10 players, excluding Gabrielius Maldūnas, who did not play the entire game, and Deividas Sirvydis, who only played for a little over six minutes (he scored 2 points!), Lithuania's rotation was not inferior to that of the United States.

Moreover, most of these players belong to the younger generation who can play in top leagues, and they have a certain level of experience, skills, and competitiveness. The advantages that the United States is accustomed to have been weakened to a low point, and even though they fought hard to catch up, they still fell short. Just when fans thought the game was about to enter garbage time, the United States did not give up, and they deserve applause.

Even though they were significantly behind, these players still gave their all. In the third quarter, they accelerated their offense and exerted full defensive pressure, twice narrowing the score to just four points.

With less than 10 seconds left and trailing by four points, they even managed to steal the ball. Furthermore, a wide-open three-pointer appeared at the baseline. If that shot had gone in, the outcome of the game would have been uncertain. Although their defense allowed Lithuania to shoot over 50% from three-point range, they still created turnovers, resulting in Lithuania committing 19 turnovers throughout the game.

Anthony Edwards, the leading scorer for the United States, once again scored a high of 35 points on 26 attempts, showing the dominance of a team's top player.

The impressive blocks from Tyrese Haliburton and Brandon Ingram, and the players diving on the floor for every possible loose ball, they fought until the last moment, and they can be proud of themselves even in defeat.
