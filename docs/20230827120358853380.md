# Olympic Qualifiers Nurkic and Musa Complain Again About the Inability of the Bosnian Basketball Federation to Provide Basic Needs



According to Bosnian players Jusuf Nurkic and Dzanan Musa, the Bosnian Basketball Federation has repeatedly failed to meet the basic needs of the players due to financial constraints. This has severely impacted their treatment, as they have been unable to afford warm-up matches and have had to form temporary teams without a conditioning coach. In addition, they have had to share beds and sleep in cramped conditions to save expenses. These issues came to light during last year's EuroBasket, when Nurkic posted a time-limited story on Instagram showing the players flying in economy class to Germany, sparking a lot of discussion. Many media outlets subsequently interviewed Bosnian players, including Nurkic, who openly expressed their dissatisfaction with the poor conditions provided by the federation. They emphasized that playing for the national team is the easiest part, as they have to take care of many things themselves before the matches.

Currently, Bosnia is participating in the Olympic Qualifiers in the European region, and Nurkic, Musa, and others are representing their beloved country. However, they haven't forgotten to mention what the federation has prepared for them.

Nurkic said, "This issue has plagued our country for the past 30 years, and we are here to deliver a strong message. We cannot get the most basic needs, and there is no one we can turn to for help. Our performance consistently exceeds the environment provided by the association. We are still sleeping four people in one room."

"We are going to Poland for a game, but we don't have a conditioning coach. We want to ensure that future players who want to play for the national team have a proper environment. We feel like a circus here, and more players will eventually choose to play for other national teams," added Nurkic.

Musa, who was selected by the Brooklyn Nets and currently plays for Real Madrid, also expressed his thoughts. He stated that he doesn't know what else to say and that playing for the national team during the off-season is purely driven by his passion, not for money or fame. Regarding the situation of four players sleeping in the same room, Musa said, "Nurkic has made this issue known to everyone. The team must resolve it quickly. We cannot let this continue. When four basketball players sleep together, our feet keep touching each other."
