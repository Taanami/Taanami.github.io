 As the 9th FIFA Women's World Cup, co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia, is set to kick off on July 20th, the Western Springs Association Football Club, a women's team in New Zealand, has reached an agreement with its management to equalize their salaries and resources with their male counterparts.

Pip Meo, a former member of the New Zealand women's national team, who played a key role in the agreement, pointed out that the fight for equal pay is not just about salaries, but also about the value of women's sports and the positive message it sends to generations of young girls who wear soccer cleats.

"We can't celebrate yet because we have to see how this deal plays out, and we only got what we should have gotten," said Meo.

According to The Washington Post, while New Zealand's global image has been steadily improving, its soccer industry has long suffered from unequal pay and resource distribution between men and women. Most soccer clubs in New Zealand are amateur clubs run by volunteers and players can only earn a maximum of $94 per week, as determined by the national soccer federation.

However, the issue of equal pay has not received much attention from the government. In the New Zealand soccer industry, women receive much lower salaries, have less access to playing fields, equipment, training opportunities, and coaching staff compared to men. It's common for women's teams to have only one coach, while men's teams have several.

Last year, members of the Manukau United Football Club in New Zealand launched a campaign for equal pay and resources for men and women, but it ended in failure. Maia Jackman, a team member, said, "Many female players will speak out for themselves, but they will be discouraged and eventually give up. But the people at Western Springs are different. They have been firm in their beliefs and have not backed down."

In 2023, Meo and Jackman joined the Western Springs Association, a board of directors mostly made up of men, in an attempt to achieve gender equality in the soccer world.

After two months of negotiations, a 12-hour marathon mediation session, and the threat of a strike, Meo and Jackman, along with two pro bono lawyers, reached an agreement with the club's management to achieve gender equality. The club also issued a statement apologizing for its past mistakes.

In response to the successful negotiations, Meo said they cannot be too happy yet as the new agreement has not officially been implemented. Jackman added, "At the end of the day, we just want to play soccer without any restrictions or concerns."

Jackman said her focus now is on the World Cup, hoping to showcase the beauty of women's soccer to the world through this event.

According to CBS and Lexology, unequal pay between genders is still a prevalent issue in many sports around the world.

In basketball, for example, the average annual income for male players in the NBA is $5.3 million, with top players earning much more, such as Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant with annual salaries of $45.7 million and $42 million respectively. In comparison, the average annual income for female players in the WNBA is only $130,000, with the highest earning player in the league making only $230,000. However, the reports also pointed out that the main reason for the significant wage gap between men and women in sports is the difference in popularity and revenue generated. The NBA generated $10 billion in revenue last season, while the WNBA only made $60 million. However, in the case of American football, the US women's national team has generated more revenue and viewership than the men's team since 2019, yet their income and winnings were still lower than their male counterparts until last year. According to Lexology, the most effective way to promote gender equality in sports is to increase the promotion of women's sports. This includes encouraging advertising media to promote female athletes and encouraging businesses to invest in and sponsor women's sports and athletes. This will bring more attention to female athletes, generate more revenue, and help promote equal pay between genders.
