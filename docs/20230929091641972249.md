 NBA player Tyson Chandler reminisced about the journey to the 2011 championship, stating that he didn't expect to sweep the Lakers and that the Thunder was the toughest opponent. Chandler, who played for the Mavericks at the time, shared his thoughts on Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson's podcast. He praised Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry as key players, with Chandler describing Nowitzki as a machine and Terry as someone who always made crucial shots. Matt Barnes, who was with the Lakers during that time, mentioned that Terry made 10 three-pointers against them, making them feel defeated. Chandler even mentioned telling his friends and family in Los Angeles that he would visit them after the series, but his team's sweep of the Lakers prevented him from doing so. When discussing the Thunder, both Barnes and Chandler agreed that they were a young, formidable, and difficult team, with players like James Harden coming off the bench and Kendrick Perkins as a tough presence in the starting lineup. Finally, they talked about the Heat in the Finals, specifically mentioning that it was the season when LeBron James joined the team. Chandler believed that the Heat were not well-prepared to face their team, despite the general consensus being that the Mavericks would lose and be defeated by the Heat. Stephen Jackson added that people only focused on the big names, but if you studied the rosters and player attributes, the Mavericks were the better team. Chandler agreed completely with Jackson's statement.
