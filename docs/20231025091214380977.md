  Asian Games Basketball Final: China and Mongolia Face Off for Crucial Victory 

September 28, 2023 23:14 United Daily News / Special Correspondent Zeng Siju / Instant Report from Hangzhou In the crucial game of the Asian Games men's basketball group stage, although the Chinese team was able to contend with the tall lineup of the host, their perimeter defense faltered as the opponent scored 15 three-pointers, resulting in a 69-89 defeat. In order to secure the second place in the group, the Chinese team will have to defeat Mongolia in their final group stage match. Team captain Zeng Wendong has directly declared a "must-win order," while coach Sang Maosen pointed out the key points for the upcoming game.

Sang Maosen mentioned that the opponent China faced today, China, had an absolute height advantage. In order to protect the inside, the Chinese team focused on defense, but they missed out on several defensive rebounds, allowing the opponent to score from the outside. He added, "The biggest problem for us is that every player was marked tightly on offense, making it difficult to create opportunities." Despite losing by a 20-point margin, Sang Maosen still praised the Chinese team's fighting spirit, but there is still room for improvement in their defensive communication and rotation. The Asian Games men's basketball tournament has a total of 16 teams participating, divided into four groups in the preliminary round. The group winners will advance directly to the quarterfinals, while the second and third place teams will compete in crossover matches for the remaining four spots. China will face Mongolia in their final group stage match, and a victory will secure their second place in the group.

The Chinese team does not have much knowledge about Mongolia, but they have done their homework based on Mongolia's previous game against China. Sang Maosen believes that their opponents in the next game are very active and have a positive attitude. Although China had a disadvantage in size today, they may have an advantage in the next game against Mongolia. In order to have a chance to play to their strengths, the Chinese team will have to guard the rebounds well and execute their signature transition offense.

Mongolia also played against Hong Kong at the same time today, but they suffered their second consecutive defeat with a score of 64-69. Hong Kong, who replaced Lebanon in the Asian Games, started with a win. Currently, both Hong Kong and China have a record of 1 win and 1 loss. In terms of strength, it will be difficult for Hong Kong to upset the host in their final match, which means that the Chinese team, who defeated Hong Kong in their first game, has almost secured the second place in the group.
