 Article: It must be said that this year's dunk contest was surprisingly exciting.

Why? Mainly because the past few dunk contests have been quite lackluster. But honestly, it's not their fault. I often feel that after the classic showdown between Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine in 2016, the audience's taste has been raised. If they can't come up with more creative dunks, more explosive tension, or more elegant aerial displays, then naturally it will be considered boring. However, these dunks require a high level of talent (jumping ability, hang time) to perform, and even if you have the talent, you still need to innovate in terms of creativity. These conditions have become a high barrier for dunk contests to surpass in terms of viewership. But Mac McClung, a white guard who emerged from the development league, has refreshed everyone's perspective. "He deserves to be in the NBA." "Although he is a bit short, this kid can really jump." "I believe Mac McClung won't miss a dunk." "He might even set a record for a non-NBA player winning the dunk contest." Pre-game analyst Shaquille O'Neal didn't hesitate to show his appreciation for this young man. So who is Mac McClung?

Mac McClung has been a talented athlete since he was young. Despite his height of only 188 cm, his explosive athleticism sets him apart from his peers. He was an absolute key player on his high school basketball team and even broke the school's all-time scoring record.

The previous record holder, Allen Iverson, is not a nobody but a famous former basketball star. "He has been very good to me, a great mentor. He has taught me a lot of things that will be very helpful for my future." McClung's impressive performance naturally caught Iverson's attention, and he invited the young guard to participate in his own classic game. During the game, McClung's dunks left a deep impression on Iverson, and according to McClung's recollection, Iverson even had a good conversation with him after the game.

It is his outstanding offensive ability that attracted many college invitations for McClung. Ultimately, he chose to attend Georgetown University, just like Iverson. However, the increased intensity from high school to college affected McClung's offensive ability, and his shooting percentage was not ideal. Even after transferring schools after two years, there was no improvement in the new environment.

After all, his height was too short, and if his ball handling and shooting skills weren't top-notch... Yes! At this level, being top-notch is not enough. Without being super elite to compensate for his height disadvantage, it's really difficult to survive on the college court, let alone the NBA.

So after spending three years in college and realizing that his draft projections hadn't changed much, McClung ultimately decided to enter the draft and pursue his dream.

Unlike a passionate manga, he was not drafted. In the 2021 draft, no team was willing to give him a chance.

But this didn't deter McClung from pursuing his dream of playing in the NBA. He immediately sought opportunities in the development league and spent time with the Lakers, Bulls, and Warriors' development teams. He eventually signed a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers this year, but he still spent most of his time honing his skills in the development league.

"I feel a bit careless on the defensive end. I need to find ways to improve in every game. I think I've done well in lob passes. But in other types of passes, I can definitely do better." McClung worked hard to refine his skills in the development league. When he was released by the Warriors last season, head coach Steve Kerr had a serious conversation with him, pointing out that as a player of his height, he needed to improve his passing skills in addition to scoring. Under McClung's efforts to improve, he was named the Development League's Rookie of the Year last season.

"If it happens, it would be amazing! It means I've earned recognition in the NBA!" In fact, McClung is like a player in a game who allocates all his points to athleticism. His flexibility is amazing, and he often uploads videos of himself dunking on his personal social media platforms, garnering more fans than some NBA players.

He didn't stop his high-flying dunks just because he was in the development league. On the contrary, many fans look forward to his spectacular dunks every night. It is this high popularity that caught the attention of the league and allowed him to participate in this year's dunk contest.

"I'm lucky and grateful for the opportunity given to me by the NBA." For his first dunk, McClung flew over two defenders, tapped the ball off the backboard, and then threw it down, showcasing both difficulty and creativity, earning him a perfect score of 50.

For his second dunk, McClung jumped up, pulled a 360-degree spin in the air, and then dunked the ball, with one judge even already raising a 50-point sign. However, in the total score, because one judge gave him only 49 points, McClung's score was 49.8, which was enough for him to enter the final.

For his third dunk, McClung flew over one defender, executed two spins in the air, and then threw down a reverse dunk, earning a perfect score of 50 without any controversy. For his final dunk, McClung put on his high school jersey, jumped and rotated nearly 540 degrees in the air, and then dunked the ball. After landing, he imitated Vince Carter's famous gesture from a past dunk contest, saying, "It's over." This dunk received applause from the entire arena without any doubt, and McClung won the dunk contest championship.

"If you guys are willing to have me, I'll definitely come back." After the game, when asked if he would defend his title next year, McClung said he would be more than happy to as long as he is still in the league. Perhaps he also knows that he still has many shortcomings if he wants to establish himself in the league. After all, there have been many players who have won the dunk contest but lost their place in the NBA. "I've always wanted to see some scenery I've never seen before. I hope I can achieve it with my dunks."
