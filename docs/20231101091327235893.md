The 4 Meanings of Jeremy Lin Joining New Taipei Kings:

Finally, some good news for Taiwan basketball this year! Just a few days ago, Jeremy Lin confirmed his return to P.League+, joining his brother with New Taipei Kings. I think Lin's return is a positive development in many ways. Let me use four perspectives to analyze the significance of the "Lin-sanity" news and discuss what it means. Please continue reading.

First, for the entire Taiwan basketball scene, Lin's return is one of the few 100% positive news of the summer. This summer, Taiwan basketball has been in the spotlight, with the retirement of Lin Chih-chieh, contract disputes involving Lin Ping-sheng, and the recent conflict between the Basketball Association and the Players' Union. While these news items have made for an exciting summer in Taiwanese basketball, whether it is a good or bad thing is open to interpretation. Most of these news items have nothing to do with basketball itself. While it may be entertaining for us to follow along as spectators, from the perspective of the overall basketball environment in Taiwan, I don't think it's healthy for an industry to have this many explosive events in a short period of time.

Lin's return, in my personal opinion, can redirect people's attention back to basketball before the season begins. Otherwise, every day the news about Taiwan basketball will be mixed in with social news. To be honest, that's not a good thing. Almost all of the news during the off-season, aside from the World Cup warm-up games and the Jones Cup, have been social news. I hope that Lin's return can shift the focus back to basketball itself. I understand that exposure is good for an emerging industry, but when all the exposure is negative, that's not ideal.

In summary, I believe that Lin's return before the season starts can redirect the public's focus back to the court, which is definitely a huge contribution to the Taiwanese sports community.

Please continue reading.

I mentioned earlier that we need to shift the focus back to basketball itself. Now, let's discuss the impact on the team's strength. First, let's talk about New Taipei Kings. Assuming no injuries, I don't know how this team can lose. Lin's addition to Bank of Taiwan Steel, a team that finished last in the league last year, nearly made the playoffs. Now he is joining last year's runner-up team. What does this mean? Under P.League+'s regulations, Lin is considered a local player due to his Chinese heritage. This means he is not restricted by the fourth-quarter playing time limit and the number of foreign players allowed on the court in each game. This is already a huge advantage. Not to mention that New Taipei also has another foreign player, Davis, who is considered a local player as well. What does this mean? Other teams can only have one foreign player on the court in the fourth quarter, but New Taipei Kings? They can have three.

I know many people joke about Taiwan Beer Brave Monkeys as the "Universal Warriors." I have no disrespect towards Mr. Hsu or Mr. Chih, they are definitely legendary figures in Taiwan. Young players like Gu Yuhao and KJ are also very talented. But how do you compare them to Lin? Or to Mullens? There is a gap in terms of strength. Please continue reading.

I want to add one more point. Lin's addition is not just an upgrade in terms of strength for Taiwan's basketball teams. How did he transform Bank of Taiwan Steel last season? He improved the team's culture from top to bottom, taught young players how to play, and even helped explain tactics on the court. He is a player, trainer, and assistant coach all in one. With his leadership, do you think the young players on New Taipei Kings, such as Su Shih-hsuan and Chen Chun-nan, have a chance to improve? I believe that Lin's addition to the team will have a huge impact, both on and off the court, and he is definitely a top player in Taiwan.

Let me summarize New Taipei Kings' core lineup for next season. First, in the backcourt, they have last year's MVP, Shih Wei, and national team player Kuo Yen-hung. Add to that the super foreign player Lin, and you have the most star-studded backcourt in the league. As for the wings, they have foreign player Manny and a slightly weaker bench, but they still have players who can contribute. Finally, in the paint, they have the league's best foreign player, Mullens, and Q, who is considered a local player but has the strength of 0.8 foreign players. After listing these players, do you feel the strength of this team? Let's look at Bank of Taiwan Steel. Many people say that there's no point in watching them without Lin, but I disagree. Their local lineup is not bad, right? At least it's much better than last season. Bank of Taiwan Steel has added Shi Jin-yao and Chen Guan-quan to their local lineup, which is a big upgrade. Shi Jin-yao was a P.League+ team of the year a few years ago and was supposed to help Taiwan qualify for the Olympics this year. He is recognized by the country as a talented player. Just looking at the local paint, his contribution is second to none. With these two players and Lu Zheng-ru, Bank of Taiwan Steel's mid-level players are not bad. I think they are similar to Taiwan Beer and Dreamers. They also have a young star like Chen You-wei, who played with Lin for half a season and trained with him during the Jones Cup. Is it too much to say that he is a star player in P.League+? Looking at the big picture, I don't think Bank of Taiwan Steel is hopeless. If they can find a better foreign player, someone with strong individual skills, their lineup will be formidable. They could even fight for a playoff spot.

Please continue reading.

Finally, the most important point. Let's look at the impact of Lin's return on the Taiwan basketball market. I mentioned this earlier, but Lin's return is a godsend for P.League+. With just New Taipei Kings, Bank of Taiwan Steel, Taiwan Beer, and Dreamers, there are four media outlets, four teams, and eight commercial partners that can collaborate on various types of projects. Lin has his own fans and international partners, but let's not discuss that for now. Just in Taiwan, Lin's return is a turning point for the Taiwan basketball market. For the past ten years or so, the market has relied on one team. In other words, if there are no Taiwanese players, P.League+'s operations will be affected. I think everyone is well aware of this. But this time, with Lin's return, we can see that with just one Lin, he can make an impact. This is a huge turning point for the development of Taiwan basketball. I don't believe that Lin's return can solve all the problems in Taiwan basketball, but what is certain is that the positive effects he brings can continue to drive the development of Taiwanese basketball.

Lin's return is a turning point for P.League+ and Taiwan basketball. It is also a new challenge for New Taipei Kings and Lin himself. I look forward to the start of this season and I hope that Lin can continue to showcase his magical charm with New Taipei Kings.
