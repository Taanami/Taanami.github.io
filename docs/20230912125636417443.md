 Interview with the cutest sports anchor, Li Yihan: A sports jersey represents not only a team but also a spirit.

Li Yihan, currently working as a sports anchor at ETTV, recalls her first time hosting an event, which was an outdoor basketball game in Taoyuan. The game used the innovative "glow ball" developed by ANGO, which amazed her and left a deep impression of the brand. During her time at ELEVEN Sports, she noticed that teams like Taipower and Tatung were wearing ANGO jerseys during the broadcast of the Taiwan Enterprise Football League. This sparked her interest in getting to know ANGO and discovering that ANGO is not just a sports equipment manufacturer, but also develops high-quality jerseys for both football and basketball, providing athletes with more options.

Please continue reading as we explore the encounter between a new generation sports anchor and a new generation sports brand and jerseys. What new possibilities will emerge for the sports industry and the future of Taiwan? What does the perfect jersey look like in the eyes of a sports anchor? Although ANGO is a new sports brand, its jersey designs are refreshing and the material meets the needs of athletes, offering functionality such as moisture-wicking and quick-drying. Li Yihan, wearing an ANGO jersey during the interview, praised it, saying, "I think ANGO jerseys are great because they not only look good and feel comfortable, but they also consider many details that girls care about, such as transparency, coverage, and sleeveless designs."

Clearly, creating a good jersey is not easy. In addition to maintaining high quality standards and ensuring comfort and style, it also requires thoughtful design to meet the needs of users. This is something that the brand needs to put effort into.

Please continue reading as we explore how ANGO's professional jerseys have made their way from the football field into the basketball realm, leading in high-end functionality and performance. Li Yihan, who has been closely following the sports industry, has been passionate about sports since high school and even joined the basketball team in college. Her first job after entering the workforce was as a sports reporter, so she understands the impact of sports brands from a different perspective. "I know that ANGO has collaborated with JHBL (Junior High Basketball League) this year, sponsoring customized jerseys, warm-up clothes, and socks for the players. I think this is great because it not only acknowledges the importance of the JHBL competition but also promotes the visibility of Taiwanese sports brands. It's a mutual support and benefit." Based on her own experience playing sports, Li Yihan understands how important sponsorship and encouragement are for student teams, which is why she appreciates ANGO's commitment to grassroots sports, such as sponsoring balls and jerseys.

Although ANGO initially focused on the football market, it has recently entered the basketball field, providing high-quality jerseys for more talented athletes, allowing them to perform at their best. Despite expanding its supply chain, ANGO maintains an environmentally friendly manufacturing process, which has impressed Li Yihan and her commitment to environmental protection. Just like a perfect jersey should not only focus on athletes but also consider the entire industry ecosystem and manufacturing environment.

If ANGO can maintain an environmentally friendly spirit, it will not only contribute to the sports industry but also to the planet.

A jersey represents not only a team but also a spirit. Li Yihan, who has reported numerous sports events, chose to enter this field not only because she admired and was curious about working in television but also because she had a passion and love for sports. She has steadily made her way to where she is today, even earning the title of "cutest anchor," which fully reflects her innocent enthusiasm and professionalism in her work.

Passion and dedication are essential qualities of the sports spirit. "I think work is similar to sports; you have to constantly improve your professionalism and skills." Li Yihan has a serious and determined temperament. Despite becoming a celebrity as an anchor, often subjected to scrutiny and rumors from online trolls, she is willing to change her mindset and continue to push herself.

"My next goal is to improve my ability to broadcast sports events, especially my favorite basketball events. I also hope to one day step into the Olympic venue and report on Olympic events."

Li Yihan's clear goals and confident demeanor as she speaks reflect her determination to rise up and hit the target, just like preparing to shoot a basketball and scoring with a resounding success. In the damp and cold December, let ANGO's hat and T-shirt warm your heart.
