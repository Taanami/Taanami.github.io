 Rough Growth: DeAndre Hunter's Development Position

By 2023, the Atlanta Hawks began to feel dissatisfied with their current situation. With a new coaching staff and a completely different strategy from the previous season, the Hawks decided to rebuild the forgotten years. Please continue reading to learn more.

In the summer of this year, even before the start of the free agent market, the Hawks quickly cleared John Collins, showing their determination to reshape the team's brand. Collins' high salary and declining on-court efficiency were some of the reasons for this move. In the 2022-23 season, he struggled to play alongside Clint Capela and his on-court role was once again in question.

On the other side of the Hawks' roster, De'Andre Hunter, who is about to turn 26 this December, has a career resume that falls short compared to Collins' peak performance of nearly "20-10" per game. Although Hunter is a more reliable shooter than Collins and can create offensive space for the team, his rebounding and offensive creativity are below average compared to other wing and forward players in the league.

Most concerning is that Hunter's plus-minus value has been below -1.5 in the past two seasons from a per 100 possessions perspective.

This brings us to the next question: How should De'Andre Hunter develop? Compared to when he was drafted, he now faces tougher competition. Bogdan Bogdanovic is an efficient shooter and can be a primary playmaker, Saddiq Bey showcased his skills after joining the team midway through last season, and sophomore AJ Griffin is ready to spread his wings again. What about Hunter?

During the Hawks' rebuilding period, he quickly established himself on the team after being selected with the fourth overall pick in the 2019 draft. In the past four years, he has started 200 out of 206 regular season games, averaging 31.1 minutes per game.

In summary, he has been the undisputed starting small forward on this team. However, if Hunter struggles at the beginning of the new season and other wing options on the bench show promise, he will face the first positional crisis of his career. Last summer, he signed a four-year, $90 million contract extension with the team, but his current performance has not lived up to that price tag.

The Hawks need him to provide defensive impact on the wing and even at the point of attack, especially in specific matchups. However, advanced defensive statistics show that his impact is still limited, and his defense has even declined in recent years. According to Basketball-Reference's Stathead database, in the 2022-23 season, only six players in the league played at least 2,000 minutes but had a Box Plus/Minus (BPM) value below -3.0, and a defensive BPM below -1.0. Among these six players, only three are not rookies, and Hunter is one of them.

This explains why there have been frequent trade rumors surrounding Hunter, with Pascal Siakam often being mentioned in those discussions, possibly due to salary matching.

Brad Rowland of Uproxx recently stated on the "Locked on Hawks" podcast, "There is one person that I'm very, very, very confident will be on the trade block, about 99% sure, and that's Hunter."

We'll wait and see. In conclusion, from various angles, it is evident that the Hawks have a strong motivation to trade Hunter in order to get rid of his high-priced contract.

However, with Collins gone, Hunter may have the opportunity to play a larger role at the power forward position, where his spot-up shooting skills can be more effectively utilized. For example, when Trae Young and Clint Capela execute a pick-and-roll, defenders will be hesitant to help too much due to Hunter's outside shooting threat. Some may question if Hunter can handle the defensive responsibilities against bigger forwards and how efficient he will be on the boards. These are the accompanying questions that will arise. However, in the short term, he should be a competent versatile power forward according to the standards of a non-traditional one.

In summary, the Hawks are facing an awkward crossroad. Can they afford to let Hunter go in a lineup that lacks perimeter defense? And if they keep Hunter, can they handle the ensuing salary pressure?
