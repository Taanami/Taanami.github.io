  Turning the impossible into possible: A thank you to Chinese men's basketball team for winning the 3x3 Asian Games gold medal

Nobody expected it, but the Chinese men's basketball team won the seemingly impossible 3x3 Asian Games gold medal. As we all know, basketball is not just about skills, it also heavily relies on physical attributes. And for Taiwan, a small country in Asia, to compete at a high level in international tournaments is not an easy task.

Before the championship game, the Chinese team had already surpassed many strong opponents, including defeating China in the quarterfinals and overturning Korea in the semifinals. These victories were unexpected, as many believed that it was impossible for the Chinese team to beat these strong 5x5 teams in a 3x3 game. But the Chinese team proved everyone wrong and solidly won these matches. At this point, just reaching the finals was already a great achievement for the Chinese team.

But when the Qatar players were introduced, standing tall and muscular, while the Chinese team looked smaller in comparison, I couldn't help but think, "Let's just not lose too badly. A silver medal is already great." And in the beginning of the game, it seemed like the Qatar team was dominating, with their two shooters and one inside player quickly taking a 5-point lead. I thought to myself, "This is the difference between us."

However, fueled by our love for our country and my personal love for 3x3 basketball (it's basically Taiwan's national sport and you can play it anywhere), I still had hope for our team. Even though Qatar's shooters were accurate and our offense wasn't working, I couldn't help but curse in front of the TV, "How can we not make any shots?" "What kind of defense is this? They're not even attacking the inside and they're still more accurate than us." Throughout the game, the Chinese team was constantly behind, and I believe all Taiwanese fans thought it would be a difficult game to win.

But as those who watched the broadcast know, in the last minute of the game, the Chinese team miraculously tied the score and in the final seconds, Qatar committed their 8th team foul, allowing Lin Xinkuan to make two free throws and secure the victory.

It was an incredible comeback, a game that no one believed the Chinese team could win.

As I watched the game, I noticed that Qatar's initial accuracy was slipping and the Chinese team was gradually maintaining a decent scoring rate from the outside and more aggressively attacking the inside, resulting in more fouls on the Qatar team. And in terms of strategy and passing, the Chinese team became more focused and aggressive, finding ways to score.

In terms of physicality, Qatar seemed to be declining while the Chinese team was gritting their teeth and fighting on. In terms of mentality, the Chinese team's strong desire to turn the game around was evident as they continued to trail behind.

From watching the game on TV to witnessing the award ceremony, I couldn't help but shout and feel deeply moved.

As Coach Xu Jinzhe (who was the commentator for this game) mentioned, the Chinese team's selection strategy was to focus on taller players (around 190cm) who were capable of shooting from the outside. Out of the 8 players who trained together for 6 months before the Asian Games, the final 4 were Lin Xinkuan, Jiang Jun, Yu Xiangping, and Wang Zheyu (of course, the coaching staff played a crucial role as well). The other 4 players also deserve recognition.

This game was like life, nothing is impossible. This game sparked heated discussions among fans and most importantly, it showed that in basketball, we are the underdogs, the Mission Impossible. But this team, who was looked down upon domestically and internationally, shattered everyone's expectations.

If we were to rationally analyze the factors that contributed to this gold medal victory, it would include the initial selection strategy, the team chemistry, and the players' strong determination and perseverance. But what touched me the most was how this victory by the Chinese team has become an inspiration for all of us, both on and off the court. This is something that we can never get tired of hearing: "Maybe no one believes in themselves, or they think they have reached their limit. But all choices and actions should come back to ourselves. Never limit yourself, because once you step onto the court, it's an opportunity to give it your all and leave no regrets." I believe that in the coming days, there will be more articles and discussions about the legendary performance of the Chinese men's 3x3 basketball team. But for now, I just want to say thank you to the team for showing us the power of teamwork and proving Taiwan's capabilities, and for bringing us so much positive energy.
