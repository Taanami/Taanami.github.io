This year, Wu Bo Lin Yu represented the Northern Division senior team in the TGF World Fire Cup, and led them to the FINAL 4. Teammate Cai Jingzhou, who won both the Assist King and Steal King titles in the finals, is also a representative of the Fire Cup alumni. This tournament brings together players from various schools such as Shih Hsin University, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, National Taiwan University of Physical Education and Sport, and even the NCAA. After winning the runner-up in the Northern Division, they continued to the national finals. To them, basketball is like a remote control, representing their home in the Fire Cup. They are all sharing this remote control, tuning the TV to the most exciting and suitable program, just like finding the most comfortable rhythm for their team in the Fire Cup.

Unlike in the past, this year they participated in the Fire Cup as representatives of the senior team. Cai Jingzhou expressed his satisfaction, saying, "It is filled with a sense of preciousness. It is not easy to build a stage, because we are standing on a stage that others have built and showing our skills. If it were us building the stage, the feeling would be even more different. So I cherish this opportunity even more and can only express it with cherishment!" Please continue reading.

The Fire Cup gives them a unique experience, bringing players from different regions together to compete. It is very exciting, and each region has its own style. It not only showcases the players' skills, but also the interactions on and off the court. As the name suggests, the Fire Cup is about passing on and sharing. They hope to pass on this stage and enjoy it while cherishing it. Please continue reading.

Compared to the single school and cross-school divisions, it is even more challenging for the senior team to gather together. However, the fact that everyone is willing to come together from all over the world during the summer to play basketball is something worth commemorating. Whether they become teammates or opponents in the future, or even colleagues at work, it is a deeper connection. The tournament may end, but the relationships will not. They look forward to meeting again in the future and taking a step further towards their dreams. Please continue reading.
