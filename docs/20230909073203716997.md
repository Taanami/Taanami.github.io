  Aggressive Leadership and Germany's Unfinished Business in the 2023 World Cup

The preparations for the previous EuroBasket tournament have clearly had an impact on the present. Maxi Kleber, wanting to fully prepare for the NBA season, declined to represent the national team, which led to Dennis Schroder publicly criticizing him.

A year later, despite Kleber expressing his desire to participate, the comments made by the German national team's "leader" still hurt him, making him feel unwelcome and reluctant to approach national team head coach Gordon Herbert.

Please continue reading about Germany in the FIBA World Cup â€“ Previous Achievements and Best Results. Germany has participated in the World Cup a total of seven times, but they have only advanced to the semifinals twice, with their best result being a bronze medal in 2002.

In that tournament, Dirk Nowitzki had an outstanding performance (24 points, 11 rebounds), but Germany was still defeated by Argentina in the semifinals.

In the battle for third place, Nowitzki once again delivered an excellent performance with 29 points, leading Germany to victory over New Zealand.

Four years ago, Germany ambitiously entered the FIBA World Cup but suffered a setback as they were eliminated in the first round by the Dominican Republic. Please continue reading about their path to qualification.

Germany, unsurprisingly, has qualified for the FIBA World Cup this year. They only lost one game in the first stage (5 wins, 1 loss), which was against Estonia in the opening round. In the second part of the qualification, they continued their dominance, finishing with a total score of 10-2, securing the top spot.

Key Players: Perhaps this may sound critical, but the team's current leader seems to be a bit misnamed due to his own behavior. After all, the condition for becoming a leader is recognition from others, not just one's own opinion. Of course, Dennis Schroder is undoubtedly the most important player. Without his excellent performance in the previous World Cup, Germany would not have won the bronze medal.

Perhaps on the court, it has never been an issue. But when an important player in the lineup decides not to help the national team due to the "leader's" public statements, it becomes a significant problem.

Last season, Schroder played in 66 NBA games for the Los Angeles Lakers.

There, he averaged 12.6 points and 4.5 assists per game. In addition, the Wagner brothers have already proven themselves to be reliable. Last year, Schroder and Franz Wagner were bronze medalists in the EuroCup.

Moritz Wagner was unable to participate due to injury, but he had an excellent performance at the Olympics two years ago. Johannes Thiemann and Johannes Voigtmann, as two experienced European league players, cannot be ignored, and Isaac Bonga can defend all positions from one to five. All three can threaten opponents from the perimeter.

With the size and abilities of Daniel Theis in the paint, it won't be easy for opponents to gain an advantage against Germany inside.

Maodo Lo in the backcourt will be the backup plan when Schroder is off the court, as he has proven multiple times with his scoring ability.

However, the most anticipated C&S player is Andreas Obst. Despite missing most of last season due to injury, Obst is now healthy and ready to provide his most potent weapon to the national team â€“ three-point shooting. In this aspect, he is undoubtedly one of the best players in the European leagues.

Head Coach Gordon Herbert: Germany's head coach is Gordon Herbert, a Canadian-born coach.

In his illustrious career, he has led multiple professional teams and even had three stints coaching in Frankfurt.

He led them to win the German Bundesliga in 2004 and won the Coach of the Year award in 2016 representing the same team. Additionally, Frankfurt also lifted the FIBA Europe Cup trophy that season.

He has also worked with the Canadian coaching staff and served as an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors. He even coached the Georgian national men's basketball team.

He assumed the position of head coach for the German national team in 2021. In the first significant game, he led "Die Mannschaft" to win a medal at the EuroBasket for the first time in 17 years. Currently, they have gone undefeated in the preliminary round and have high expectations for the gold medal. We will soon find out if this team can achieve great results in the World Cup.
