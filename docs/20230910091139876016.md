  Jaylen Brown Signs 5-Year $95.2 Billion Contract Extension with Celtics, Setting NBA Record for Highest Salary

Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown has reached an agreement with the team on a historic contract extension, according to a report by ESPN. Brown will receive a supermax extension worth $304 million over 5 years, making it the highest salary in NBA history.

In the previous season, Brown achieved career-high averages of 26.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game. He played a crucial role in leading the Celtics to the Eastern Conference Finals, and he was selected to the All-Star Game for the first time. As a result, he qualified for a maximum contract extension with the Celtics.

According to reports from Reuters, Brown was drafted by the Celtics with the 3rd overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. He has been an All-Star twice and will earn $28.5 million next season. Starting from 2024, his extension kicks in, with his salary increasing each year. He will earn an average of $60.8 million per year, doubling his previous salary.

Brown's supermax extension surpasses the $276 million contract of Denver Nuggets' star center Nikola Jokic, making it the most lucrative contract in NBA history. Jokic has won the regular-season MVP award twice and led the Nuggets to their first NBA championship in the 2022-23 season, averaging 30.2 points, 14 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.4 steals in the NBA Finals to earn the Finals MVP. However, Jaylen Brown's reign as the highest-paid player may not last long, as his teammate Jayson Tatum will be eligible for a supermax contract next year.

Why did the Celtics invest heavily in re-signing Brown? ESPN Stats & Information research shows that Brown and Tatum formed a formidable duo last season, combining for an average of 56.7 points per game. They had 10 games where both players scored over 30 points, a feat achieved only by the "O'Neal and Bryant" duo of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the past 30 years. Additionally, according to Second Spectrum, 54% of Brown's scoring last season came from unassisted shots, and he averaged 1.15 points per drive, setting a career high.
