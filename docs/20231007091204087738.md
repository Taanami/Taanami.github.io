 Introduction to the International Team of the Changyao Cup: The Skills Factory in Atlanta, USA.

The United States, with its important position in the basketball world, is not only known for the prestigious NBA but also serves as a model for other countries in various aspects such as sports events, team systems, athlete development, sports marketing, and industry development. Among them, "preparatory schools" play an indispensable role. This year, the most anticipated team in the international college invitation list announced by the Changyao Cup is The Skills Factory from Atlanta, USA.

Established in 2011, The Skills Factory (TSF) located in Atlanta, Georgia, aims to "train and develop athletes' potential." Through age-specific, level-specific, systematic skill training, individual physical development programs, and self-organized competitions, TSF provides continuous self-improvement for athletes in their preparatory stages. NBA stars such as James Harden, Trae Young, Kemba Walker, John Wall, Joe Johnson, Malik Beasley, and more have all visited the school during the offseason for personal conditioning and preparation.

TSF offers five levels of training programs: Introductory Level, Foundational Level, Advanced Level, Performance Level, and Professional Level. These programs are tailored based on the students' age, level, goals, and needs. TSF believes that this approach can effectively develop the unique characteristics and potential of each player, and in the Performance Level, they have successfully helped over 200 students enter high schools and universities in the United States, with over 100 of them making it to the NCAA Division I. Recent examples include Isaiah Collier (USC), ranked as the "Georgia Mr. Basketball 2023," Cam Kraft (Xavier), the 10th-ranked freshman guard in the US, Aguek Arop (SDSU), the "San Diego's Best Rookie" of South Sudanese descent, Che Yu Cheng (USF), the first Taiwanese player to receive a full scholarship in D1, Kai Sotto from the Philippines, and Ma Jianhao (GSU), a graduate of Songshan High School. TSF has become a significant platform and a cradle for young basketball players from various countries pursuing their dreams in the United States.

In addition to organizing their own competitions as part of their regular training programs, TSF has been arranging overseas trips to various countries since 2017. This year, they will visit Taiwan for the first time and are looking forward to the unique experience and exchange it will bring to their players. Although the specific teams and player lists coming to Taiwan for the Changyao Cup have not been confirmed yet, it is believed that TSF's participation in the tournament will undoubtedly attract attention and generate excitement in Taiwanese high school basketball.
