 The inter-league invitation game last night was interrupted by Lin Bing-sheng, who took Cao Xun-xiang to the riverbank to shoot hoops. Taipei Taishin Warriors faced the Navigators, who had suffered two consecutive defeats before the game, and the Dreamers Training Team. It wasn't until the fourth quarter that Taipei Taishin Warriors opened up a gap with Cao Xun-xiang scoring 7 points in a single quarter. They eventually won 88-69, with Cao Xun-xiang scoring 21 points. Cao Xun-xiang revealed that after becoming "neighbors" with Lin Bing-sheng in the adjacent room, he was "harassed" every morning and evening, even going to the riverbank for training. Cao Xun-xiang disclosed, "He knocks on our door every morning and asks me to go shoot hoops. He's crazy!" Lin Bing-sheng, who became a hot topic this summer due to his contract, scored 7 points at the start of today's game and contributed 10 points in the first 12 minutes of the team. However, the Navigators and the Dreamers Training Team caught up later, trailing 20-22 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the team caught up with 8 consecutive points from Dongfang Yi-kang, but Cao Xun-xiang and Lin Yi-hui scored back-to-back, helping Taipei Taishin Warriors maintain a 67-61 lead after three quarters. They widened the gap in the fourth quarter and ultimately won 88-69, securing their third consecutive victory. Cao Xun-xiang was only on the court for 9 minutes yesterday before being fouled out. Today, he played for 22 minutes and scored 21 points, along with 6 assists. He joked, "I made up for the time I missed playing yesterday. I played more than twice the amount today." He also revealed that after joining Taipei Taishin Warriors, he became neighbors with Lin Bing-sheng. His new teammate would knock on his door at 9 o'clock in the morning. Even after team training and strength training in the evening, Lin Bing-sheng would not let him off. "At 9:30 in the evening, he would still ask me to go to the riverbank to shoot hoops. He's just that crazy!" Cao Xun-xiang also confessed that he followed Lin Bing-sheng's lead and trained early in the morning and late at night. He even vomited once after a training session, to which Lin Bing-sheng responded with a laugh, saying, "That's why he's getting thinner. His goal is to lose 16 kilograms, just like Lin Yi-hui." Why would they go to the riverbank for self-training at night? Lin Bing-sheng smiled and said, "I feel that I'm not good enough, so I need to practice and learn more." Dongfang Yi-kang, a member of the Navigators and the Dreamers Training Team, who was also Lin Bing-sheng's former teammate, coincidentally mentioned that during their time at the Bank of Taiwan, the two of them often trained independently and went to the riverbank to practice shooting, which coincided with Cao Xun-xiang's statement. Lin Bing-sheng has scored double digits in three consecutive games for Taipei Taishin Warriors.
