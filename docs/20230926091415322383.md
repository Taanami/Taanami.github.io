  Discussing the Winners and Losers of the NBA's New Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) in its First Offseason

The new version of the NBA's Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) officially took effect on July 1st! With the first offseason under the revised agreement, the league's landscape and operations have undergone significant changes. As we take a moment to reflect on the first offseason under the new CBA, let's discuss the alterations and who has benefited or suffered from them. Is it the end of superteams?

As mentioned in my previous article at the end of June, with the implementation of the second Apron (Super Tax), many powerhouse teams were unable to escape the fate of salary clearing. For example, the Warriors traded Jordan Poole, the Clippers let go of Eric Gordon, and the Hawks sold John Collins. The Suns, on the other hand, demonstrated a completely different approach by trading for Wizards' star Bradley Beal before the new CBA took effect, maximizing their cap space. This may be the last super-team in the NBA for the foreseeable future.

Exploring the Major Changes in the New CBA Under the new CBA, once a team's total salary exceeds the second Apron, they are unable to use the mid-level exception or sign-and-trade deals. The flexibility in trade amounts will also be restricted, and the future first-round draft picks will automatically become the 30th pick. The cost of building a team will be much higher than just the luxury tax. While it may be worth taking risks in the short term to compete for a championship, it will be challenging to sustain a roster with three superstars (accounting for over 30% of the salary cap) in the long run. Take the Suns, for example. In the upcoming season, Kevin Durant and Beal's salaries will account for approximately 35% of the cap, while Devin Booker's will be 26%. However, starting from the 2024-25 season, when the new contracts come into effect, their salaries will increase to approximately 35%, meaning the three Suns players will eat up around 105% of the salary cap, which is a significant burden.

Looking purely at salaries, Deandre Ayton will likely become a player that needs to be traded due to his contract. I believe the Suns won't be able to maintain a three-superstar lineup for long and will have to face the reality in the near future. The Timberwolves will be the next team to face a salary crisis. They recently signed Anthony Edwards to a five-year, $259 million extension that will come into effect starting from the 2024-25 season. Combined with Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert's contracts, they will eat up 90% of the salary cap. Unless the Timberwolves can quickly develop and prove that the twin towers are a championship-caliber configuration, they will soon face the penalties of the second Apron.

The already salary-heavy Clippers will need to make decisions in the new season to alleviate their salary pressure. They will need to accelerate the turnover of their expensive veteran players like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, whether by re-signing or breaking up the team.

This year and the next will be a transitional period for powerhouse teams, as they will need to slow down and adjust their rosters. They won't be able to strengthen their lineups through free agency using their cap space. Teams like the Suns, Timberwolves, Warriors, or Clippers may find more suitable role players through trades, but it will be challenging to sustain the current salary cap for a long time. If they don't trade away high-salary players, they will have to face rebuilding.

However, there's no need to worry. I believe that NBA executives, known for their gambling nature, will still find a way to assemble a super-team. But if they fail to win a championship, it will likely be a more painful experience than before. The more flexible trading and signing exceptions in the new CBA will benefit teams with limited financial resources. Many trading restrictions have been relaxed, and more exceptions have been introduced. As long as the team's total salary is below the two Aprons, they can expand the range of "salary matching" required for trades.

The first beneficiary is the Cavaliers, who saved up to $7.5 million in price difference to complete the sign-and-trade deal for Max Strus (4 years, $63 million). Under the old rules, the Cavaliers would have had to offer a larger and more expensive contract to the Heat. The Rockets also benefited from this new rule when they signed Dillon Brooks.

Second-round rookies now have their own exception to use. Unlike first-round rookies with standard contracts, second-round rookies previously had to use their salary cap space or split mid-level exceptions to sign 3-4 year contracts. The new second-round exception clause solves this problem.

The Kings used this exception to sign Colby Jones, the 34th pick, to a 4-year, $8.76 million contract. The Hawks also signed Mouhamed Gueye, the 39th pick, to a 4-year, $7.63 million contract, with a team option for the final year. This is seen as a way to prevent a repeat of the "Jalen Brunson situation," where players become restricted free agents and have the right to receive offers instead of being forced to stay with their current team, as the Mavericks experienced. In 2021, the Nuggets signed Michael Porter Jr. to a designated rookie contract extension worth $179.29 million over 5 years, sparking a debate. The new version of the CBA removed the limit on designated players and opened up the possibility for first-round rookies to sign 5-year contracts without any conditions.

As a result, we saw Desmond Bane of the Grizzlies sign a 5-year, $197.23 million contract, slightly below the 25% max contract, but still securing a long-term deal.

This is a sign that the NBA is encouraging drafting and developing young players. Teams have more incentives and conditions to keep their young players. Being a restricted free agent puts players at a disadvantage as their teams have the right to match any offer. This reduces their bargaining power, especially when they become restricted free agents. We witnessed this with Deandre Ayton last year, and this year, P.J. Washington and Austin Reaves entered the market as restricted free agents but chose to accept new contracts from their current teams instead of receiving offers from other teams.

According to rumors, the Spurs initially planned to offer Reaves a contract worth $100 million over 4 years or $60 million over 3 years. When they heard that the Lakers were interested, they didn't even make an offer, and Reaves ended up signing a 4-year, $56 million contract with the Lakers.

Washington, on the other hand, waited for offers from other teams but ended up with no options and chose to sign a 3-year, $48 million contract with the Hornets. The problem lies not in Washington and Reaves' reasonable contract demands but in the weakened bargaining power of restricted free agents.

Since the team has the right to match any contract, teams interested in a player would need to offer a slightly higher contract to deter the player's current team from matching it. In Washington's case, some teams may have thought it was not worth it.

If a player is attractive enough, like Reaves, who had interest from the Lakers, why would other teams waste their time? Going back and forth to become a restricted free agent usually doesn't result in the ideal contract value. Washington and Reaves, for example, could have chosen to accept the qualifying offer (QO) and become unrestricted free agents after one more year, but that would come with the risk of entering the free agency market.

An interesting exception is that restricted free agents can also be used as a way to troll other teams. The Jazz offered a three-year, $23 million contract to the 76ers' backup center Paul Reed, including a rare condition. The first season is fully guaranteed, but if the team reaches the second round of the playoffs, the next two years will also be fully guaranteed. It's unlikely that the rebuilding Jazz will meet this condition, but the 76ers have a higher chance of making it to the second round.

Only four players, Max Strus, Bruce Brown Jr., Fred VanVleet, and Dillon Brooks, have received new contracts that exceed the full mid-level exception. If we exclude Strus, there are only about 7-10 teams that can clear enough cap space to sign players to multi-million-dollar contracts. Among them, only the Pacers and Rockets are willing to spend.

When we examine the strategies of these two teams, it becomes clear that they are not truly strengthening their roster but rather focusing on reaching the salary floor. The contracts for Brown Jr. and VanVleet also include team-friendly options.

The new CBA's rules clearly encourage trades and raise the conditions for re-signing. When players can earn a significant amount by staying with their current team, more players will be willing to sign contract extensions early, leading to a decrease in the number of players entering free agency. Consequently, many teams' salary cap space has already been filled before the offseason even began.

Since 2018 and 2019, apart from Fred VanVleet this year, the last players who secured max contracts in free agency using cap space were Kawhi Leonard in 2019 and LeBron James in 2018. Most players have had to go through trades or re-signings.

Don't Expect "Salary Space" Big Buyers This Summer A notable requirement in the new CBA is that teams must reach the salary floor on the first day of the season to be eligible for the luxury tax distribution. This has put pressure on teams to spend money during the offseason. While teams like the Pacers and Rockets have handed out premium contracts, many rebuilding teams have filled their cap space through trades and invested in some functional veterans.

For example, the Pistons traded for Monte Morris and Joe Harris, the Spurs acquired Reggie Bullock from the Mavericks. Though their main goal is to meet the salary floor requirements or to focus on future trades, they have acquired valuable role players, which gives rebuilding teams a better chance to compete.

Compared to the past, where teams preferred to have cap space for big experiments, this offseason has shown that many rebuilding teams have made significant progress, providing young players with better development opportunities and making the games more exciting.
