 Introduction of Fukushima Commercial High School International Team 

Fukushima Commercial High School from Japan is set to participate in the 10th Chang Yao Cup. The Fukushima region has been associated with tragic events such as nuclear power and earthquake tsunamis, giving it the reputation of a "city of sorrow." Despite the challenges faced in the region's overall industrial innovation and development, the local citizens have always shown passionate support for sports and its growth. With a professional baseball, soccer, and basketball team, Fukushima aims to reshape the external perception through sports.

Fukushima Commercial High School's boys' basketball team was born in this environment and spirit. In 2003, the team was established under the leadership of Coach Shinya Mizuno. Coach Mizuno, known for his defensive-oriented style of play, is not only the head coach of the Japanese U18 high school boys' basketball team for the 31st Japan-China-Korea Youth Basketball Exchange Tournament, but also led Fukushima Commercial High School to three national high school basketball tournaments between 2003 and 2013, achieving their best ranking of 32nd. Coach Mizuno is currently the head coach of the Japanese U19 boys' basketball team.

In 2021, Coach Mizuno returned to coach the boys' basketball team at Fukushima Commercial High School, bringing expectations for a new era for the team. In just over three years, the school has already established itself as a powerhouse in high school basketball, reaching the finals of the newcomer championship and advancing to the top four. Despite not being able to recruit foreign players to strengthen the overall team's competitiveness due to the Japanese public school system, the focus in Japan's basketball community is now on cultivating more local players.

Fukushima Commercial High School actively challenges higher stages starting from local competitions. After participating in the Japan-China-Korea Youth Basketball Exchange Tournament at the end of August, Coach Mizuno will lead the team to Taiwan for the Chang Yao Cup. This tournament will serve as important preparation for the Winter Cup in November. Coach Mizuno stated, "Being able to compete and exchange with players of the same age from different countries is a valuable opportunity for us." Through international competition, the team aims to broaden their players' perspectives and improve their skills. The future development of Fukushima Commercial High School holds great promise.
