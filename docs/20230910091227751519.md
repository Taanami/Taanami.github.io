 The NBA Eastern Conference Finals game between the Celtics and the Heat had an incredible turnaround as the Celtics, who were initially down 0-3, managed to secure a narrow victory of 104-103 after a last-second shot by Derrick White. With this win, the Celtics have now won three games in a row and tied the series, giving them a chance to make history. 

In the first three games of the series, the Miami Heat had a commanding lead of 3-0. However, the Celtics fought back and won the fourth and fifth games, bringing the series to 2-3. In the sixth game, the Heat had a slight advantage with a 3-2 lead. 

Throughout the game, both teams were neck and neck. The Celtics took the lead in the first quarter with a score of 34-29, and maintained their lead in the second quarter with a score of 57-53. The Celtics' shooting percentage was higher than the Heat's in the first half, but their three-point shooting was not as successful, which prevented them from widening the gap.

In the second half, the Heat closed the gap to a two-point difference at one point, but the Celtics managed to pull ahead again with a series of successful shots. They led by 13 points after a three-pointer by Derrick White and two successful free throws by Jaylen Brown. By the end of the third quarter, the Celtics maintained their lead with a score of 79-72.

In the fourth quarter, the Heat started strong with an 11-3 run, taking a lead of 83-82 after a three-pointer by Duncan Robinson and a basket by Jimmy Butler. However, the Celtics quickly responded with an 8-0 run, taking back the lead at 90-83.

Jimmy Butler, the star player for the Heat, had a slow start in the game, only scoring 9 points in the first three quarters. However, he came alive in the fourth quarter, scoring 15 points and making all three free throws in the final seconds, giving the Heat a one-point lead and a chance to win the game. 

But Marcus Smart missed a three-point shot in the final seconds, and Derrick White managed to score just before the buzzer, sealing the victory for the Celtics. This comeback is unprecedented in NBA playoff history, as no team has ever overcome a 0-3 deficit. The Celtics, after losing three games in a row, have shown great resilience and have a chance to make history by winning the seventh game of the series on May 30th. 

Jayson Tatum had an outstanding performance, scoring a game-high 31 points and grabbing 11 rebounds for the Celtics. Jaylen Brown also had a strong game with 26 points and 10 rebounds, while Marcus Smart contributed 21 points. For the Heat, Jimmy Butler scored 24 points and had 11 rebounds, Caleb Martin contributed 21 points and 15 rebounds, and Bam Adebayo had a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds. 

The Celtics are now just one win away from becoming the first team ever to overcome a 3-0 series deficit. The decisive Game 7 will take place on Monday, 8:30 PM ET on TNT.
