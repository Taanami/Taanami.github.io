  US Team Suffers First Defeat to Lithuania in World Cup

The game between the US and Lithuania in the second group stage of the basketball World Cup has concluded. Lithuania defeated the US with a score of 110-104, handing them their first loss.

However, despite the loss, the US team still advanced to the quarterfinals with a record of 4 wins and 1 loss, securing their spot in the Olympics. Led by NBA veteran Jonas Valanciunas, Lithuania managed to secure a victory against the US team with a score of 110-104, even without Domantas Sabonis, and claimed the top spot in their group.

The 17-point lead in the first half quickly narrowed to only 4 points as the US team launched a comeback in the third quarter.

By the end of the third quarter, the US team had closed the gap to 65-71. However, Lithuania maintained their lead with their second unit, as each player had significant playing time and contributed to the victory. Both teams had already secured their spots in the quarterfinals last week, so this game would determine the matchups for the next stage.

As one of the top two teams in the Americas zone in the World Cup, the US team secured their place in the Olympics. The second-placed US team in the group stage will face the group leader Italy in the quarterfinals, while Lithuania will face Serbia. Jonas Valanciunas scored 12 points, grabbed 7 rebounds, and had 2 blocks, Tadas Sedekerskis recorded 11 points and 11 rebounds, Mindaugas Kuzminskas scored 14 points, Kariniauskas scored 15 points, Ignas Brazdeikis scored 11 points, Tomas Dimsa also scored 11 points, and Eimantas Bendzius scored 10 points.

This makes a total of six players scoring in double figures, with two additional players scoring 9 points each. On the other hand, Anthony Edwards scored 35 points for the US team, but none of his teammates scored more than 14 points that night.
