 According to journalist Shams Charania, Memphis Grizzlies center Steven Adams will undergo knee surgery and be out for the entire season.

Adams has not played since the end of January last year against the Phoenix Suns due to a knee injury. Initially diagnosed with a sprained posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, he had to undergo stem cell therapy. The Grizzlies announced that Adams will undergo surgery for his right posterior cruciate ligament, as non-surgical rehabilitation was unable to maintain stability in his knee. Adams appeared in two preseason games this year against the Indiana Pacers and Atlanta Hawks, but ultimately decided to undergo surgery before the start of the season. The Grizzlies not only lost Adams in the second half of last season, but also Brandon Clarke (Achilles tendon tear), putting more pressure on center Jaren Jackson Jr. Steven Adams played in 42 games last year and provided the Grizzlies with excellent defensive coverage and rebounding, averaging 8.6 points, 11.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.1 blocks per game.
