  The Silent Cultivator of the Changyao Cup: Coach Qiu Guoda from Miaoli Mingren Junior High School

"I enjoy the process of helping children build their future."

Please continue reading. In 1996, Coach Qiu Guoda took over as the head coach of the Mingren Junior High School boys' basketball team in Miaoli. From the beginning until now, he has been steadfast for nearly 30 years. He has never forgotten his original intention to focus on educating and nurturing students, regardless of fame and fortune.

Growing up as a player from a young age, Coach Qiu devoted himself to coaching after his student days. Looking back now, he admits that he never thought he would stay in this position for decades. In these long and ever-changing years, it is easy to see the changes in the basketball environment at home and abroad. The only constant is his dedication to grassroots basketball. Many outstanding players in Taiwan's basketball scene, such as CBA top pick Chen Yingjun, have been nurtured by him. The Mingren Junior High School basketball team has also achieved remarkable results in the JBHL tournament.

"A tree with deep roots will not be easily toppled by the wind." Having a good foundation during student years is crucial for future success. Moreover, Coach Qiu has been quietly helping underprivileged students, demonstrating the true meaning of education that knows no social class. 

"Grassroots basketball education requires both hardware and software. Hardware includes venues, training environments, and funding sources, which can vary depending on geographical location and create urban-rural gaps. It is important for coaches promoting grassroots basketball to close this gap.

As for the software, it involves consistent teaching materials and curriculum. A complete and seamless connection from beginners to professionals can have a positive impact." Japan's progress in the past decade is evident to all. Coach Qiu believes that as an East Asian country, if Japan can do it, then Taiwan can do it too. At the opening ceremony of the 10th Changyao Cup, Coach Qiu Guoda was awarded the "Best Contribution Award." (Photo source: Changyao Cup) "The Changyao Cup has been running for ten years now and has grown in scale and improved in quality, from high school to university, from domestic to international, providing substantial help to many. "At the 10th Changyao Cup, Chairman Xie Jianguo presented me with this award. I am very grateful and surprised. There are definitely more people in Taiwan who are dedicated to grassroots sports and education, not just me."

Coach Qiu feels grateful and humble, saying that receiving this award only represents a fraction of the people who have been steadfast in promoting grassroots basketball. He hopes to encourage and share with more people who are also dedicated to grassroots basketball, and to grow and thrive together.

Grassroots education is a journey without a clear end, a long road that may not have a clear destination, but we can feel the beauty of the changes along the way.
