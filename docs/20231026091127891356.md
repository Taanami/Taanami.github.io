 NBA's new naturalized player candidate Onyeka Okongwu is open to playing for the Philippine national team.

According to a report by Naveen Ganglani of Philippine media outlet Rappler, Atlanta Hawks center Onyeka Okongwu is open to the possibility of playing for the Philippine men's national basketball team. If Okongwu successfully naturalizes, he will greatly strengthen the team's frontcourt.

Okongwu grew up in a Filipino community in Chino Hills, California and has trained with PBA star Alex Cabagnot and the Fil-Am Nation. According to Ganglani's report, the Nigerian national team is also interested in having Okongwu naturalize, but the Philippines has the advantage. Okongwu is currently seeking his second NBA contract and will become a restricted free agent after the upcoming season. Last season, Okongwu averaged 9.9 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks for the Hawks, with a shooting percentage of 64% and a free throw percentage of 78%.
