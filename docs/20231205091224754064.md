 4 pick in 2019, which was later traded back to the Pelicans for three lower picks, one of which was used to acquire Jaxson Hayes) to form one of the strongest duos in NBA history: LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The Lakers immediately saw the payoff, finishing the regular season with a league-best record of 52 wins and 19 losses (due to the shortened season caused by the pandemic) and ultimately winning the championship in the NBA Bubble by defeating the Miami Heat.

During most of the season, the Lakers deployed a twin-tower starting lineup, with JaVale McGee starting at center and later replaced by Dwight Howard to pair up with Davis.

Now, let's take a look at the Lakers' outlook for the upcoming season as they try to replicate their success from 2019-20. However, it may not be as easy as it seems, especially after their disappointing sweep in the Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets. The Lakers' opponent in the 2019-20 Western Conference Finals was none other than the Nuggets. One of the key factors that helped the Lakers advance with a 4-1 series win was their ability to rotate between McGee and Howard to defend against Nikola Jokic, limiting his impact on the court. However, things may not be the same this time around, and there are three main reasons why.

Firstly, as mentioned in my previous article, LeBron's offensive numbers do not show any signs of significant decline (which is admirable), with the only noticeable difference being his reduced ability to drive to the basket on his first step compared to his younger days. Instead, he relies more on his jump shot to score, which was evident in the Western Conference Finals against Aaron Gordon's defense.

However, LeBron's decline is more apparent on the defensive end. As shown in the picture below, he often tends to slack off on defense, especially when guarding perimeter shooters. This means that he no longer has the energy to cover the perimeter or move around the court as much, so even though LeBron used to be able to guard point guards and even play as a center (he was selected to the NBA All-Defensive First Team for five consecutive years from 2009-2013), in the latter stages of his career, he can only play one position, and that's power forward.

A similar example is LeBron's draft classmate, Carmelo Anthony, who used to play as a small forward but now mostly plays as a power forward in the later stages of his career.

Compared to playing as a small forward, playing as a power forward requires less movement and allows for more rest time, such as posting up and grabbing rebounds.

With LeBron occupying the power forward position, do the Lakers expect AD to defend against small forwards? 

Secondly, the Lakers' new additions, Hayes and Wood, are not pure centers like McGee or Howard, but rather centers who can also play as power forwards.

At 7'0 tall, Hayes was given a chance to start for the Pelicans towards the end of the 2021-22 season due to Williamson's injury, and he ended up performing unexpectedly well while playing alongside either Jonas Valanciunas or Juancho Hernangomez.

Despite Hayes' ability to move quickly for his height and his decent shooting range, his attitude issues have hindered him from reaching his full potential, which is why he is currently only earning a minimum salary.

As for Wood, who stands at 6'10, he is more of a stretch 4 who can create space and also provides solid defense. Some may argue that I am nitpicking, and that they can simply play as centers when needed. While that may be true, my point is that Hayes or Wood lack the ability to defend against traditional centers, which means that the Lakers may still have to rely on AD to do so.

Lastly, the Lakers' new roster for the upcoming season is completely different from the championship-winning team in 2020. The Lakers' success in the 2020 season was mainly due to their strong defense, with the help of their twin-tower lineup. AD's defense speaks for itself, and LeBron was still playing at a high level defensively. Let's not forget about the Lakers' backcourt players at the time: Avery Bradley, Alex Caruso, Danny Green, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, all of whom are 3-and-D players who excel in defense but lack the ability to create their own shots. This meant that having McGee or Howard on the court did not pose a threat to their defense in the paint.

In the same season, the Houston Rockets decided to trade away their center Clint Capela to clear the way for James Harden and Russell Westbrook, and opted to play 6'7 Robert Covington at center.

Although the Rockets played small-ball against the Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals and ended up losing 1-4, it is worth noting that the Lakers' twin-tower lineup was successful mainly because of their team's overall strategy. However, with the current Lakers roster, aside from the issues with LeBron that I mentioned earlier, the starting backcourt will most likely be Russell Westbrook and Austin Reaves, even if Hayes and Wood are able to stretch the floor, their impact will still be limited. Imagine Reaves driving to the basket and being met with a big man, will he still be as effective?

In conclusion, while I believe that the Lakers will still have a decent record next season, there are still many issues that need to be addressed if they want to win another championship, especially in terms of their frontcourt and center position. LeBron's aging, the characteristics of the new players, and their team's overall strategy are all factors that need to be considered. The Lakers' last trial with LeBron, and the outlook for the 2023-24 season, is definitely something to look forward to.
