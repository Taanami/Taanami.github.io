 Kyle Kuzma recently talked to the Manila Times about his thoughts on becoming a leader on the team and his experience consulting Derek Jeter, the captain of the New York Yankees.

Kuzma expressed excitement about taking on a new role as a leader in his professional career and said that it is something he has been waiting for his whole life. He also mentioned the challenge of facing the best defenders in the league every game as a starter and the responsibility to contribute to the team on a daily basis. Kuzma sees Washington as a place where he can establish himself as a leader and an all-around player.

In preparation for this leadership role, Kuzma said he did a lot of research and consulted Derek Jeter, who spent many years as the captain of the New York Yankees.

Kuzma said, "I got really close with Jeter this summer and asked him a variety of questions. As a leader, you need to have a role model to follow. If you don't do what a leader is supposed to do, how can you expect others to trust and follow you? As a leader, I must focus on my words and actions." 

Kuzma, who signed a 4-year $90 million contract with the Wizards this year, along with a $12 million bonus, will team up with Poole to become the future core of the team.
