In recent years, rest rotation has become an important strategy for NBA teams, and how teams allocate playing time for their players is a significant consideration. The league has also taken notice of this, and the NBA Competition Committee is expected to present a new proposal for handling rest rotation to the board for a vote on Wednesday.

The main proposal is that teams will not be allowed to rest two or more (including two) star players during nationally televised games in the United States. Violating this rule will result in fines for the team, with a first offense resulting in a $100,000 fine, a second offense resulting in a $250,000 fine, and a third offense resulting in a $1 million fine. Of course, the league has defined "star players" as players who have been selected for the All-Star Game and All-NBA teams in the past three years. According to Wojnarowski's report, the league has provided five general principles for the detailed regulations.

In addition, the league has also provided several conditions under which rest rotation is allowed, specifically for regular-season back-to-back games (excluding nationally televised games): 1. Players who turn 35 on opening day. 2. Players who have played over 34,000 minutes in their professional careers. 3. Players who have played over 1,000 regular-season and playoff games.

The NBA has already set high salary increases for players in the new CBA, with more benefits and restrictions. It is required that players participate in at least 65 games in order to be eligible for individual awards. Implementing stricter rest rotation rules is undoubtedly aimed at ensuring that star players have more exposure opportunities on nationally televised stages, where more people are watching.
