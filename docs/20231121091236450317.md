  Harden's Drama in Soap Opera: What Should the 76ers Do?

The trade rumors between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Los Angeles Clippers for James Harden have come to a halt. The developments between Harden and Philadelphia have turned into the latest blockbuster soap opera in the NBA, with everyone waiting to see how it will all end. Harden made a bold statement at a recent media event in China, calling out Daryl Morey as a "fraud" and stating that he will never work with him again.

He even repeated this declaration, as if it were a climactic moment in a stage play. Harden has chosen to execute his contract worth $35.6 million for the upcoming season and requested a trade from the team in June. The 76ers promised to do their best to make it happen in July, but by mid-August, ESPN reported that they were unsuccessful and planned to have Harden return for training camp. Based on Harden's recent comments, it seems that he voluntarily took a pay cut of $14 million last year, opting out of a $47 million player option, to sign a shorter contract and allow the team to strengthen P.J. Tucker and Danuel House Jr. This was a joint decision between him and Morey.

In fact, the league conducted an investigation into the 76ers for illegally recruiting Tucker and House and revoked their second-round draft pick in 2023-24. However, there was no clear evidence found in the seized phones and emails to prove whether there was any "premeditation" between Harden and the 76ers.

If Morey really made a promise to Harden, why would Harden start seeking a trade just two months into the new season? Around Christmas last year, ESPN received a tip that Harden was already eyeing a return to the Rockets, possibly as part of a homecoming act. If he was so sure about his next contract, why would he do that? Throughout last season, the 76ers were never certain that Harden would stay in the City of Brotherly Love. The message from Philadelphia was that they would be willing to offer him a new contract if he led them to a championship, or at least reached the NBA Finals. But in the end, they were eliminated in the second round, and Harden struggled, except for Games 1 and 4 against the Celtics where he scored 45 and 42 points respectively. In the other 9 games, he only averaged a disappointing 15.1 points (on 14.4 attempts), with a two-point and three-point shooting percentage of 29.6% and 30.5%, respectively. This was the most disappointing playoff performance of Harden's career.

Despite trying to negotiate a new contract with the 76ers during the playoffs and before the start of free agency, Philadelphia refused to engage in any discussions until the market officially opened. This understandably upset Harden's camp - after all, the free agency market can change in an instant. But due to the previous sanctions, the 76ers were being cautious, which is understandable.

Harden's reputation off the court and his decline on the court have affected his market value. Even his former team, the Rockets, didn't prioritize him and instead signed Fred VanVleet from the Northern Big Wild for $83.6 million over three years. As a result, Harden decided to play the player option and focus on money.

Now, the Beard's desired destination, the Los Angeles Clippers, have also refused to offer a package that satisfies the 76ers, as Harden's performance has begun to decline. Looking ahead to the 2024 season, only the Spurs, Magic, Jazz, Raptors, Pistons, and Wizards have enough salary cap space to accommodate Harden, but it's unlikely that any of these teams will be interested. Harden's recent actions - declining a 3-year, $161 million extension with the Nets last year, the Rockets' reunion plan on Christmas last year, and now demanding a trade - all suggest that he is being led by someone else. He is currently on the only team in the league that wants to keep him and is willing to offer him the lucrative contract he wants, with a front office that has always been his staunch supporter. But even so, he has still messed things up.

When it comes to Morey and Harden's relationship, they were supposed to be a success story of a GM and player working together - they almost achieved everything except winning a championship. But now, they have reached a point where they can't even stand each other. Morey has shifted his focus to core player Joel Embiid, while Harden is thinking about how to make the most out of his remaining years.

At this point, can Harden force a trade by staying away from the team? The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) has a clause that protects the 76ers from any negative effects of Harden's actions. Will he resort to his old tactics of being lazy during training and disrupting team morale? If he repeats his past behavior or even takes more extreme measures to force the team's hand, it may backfire as other teams will also be watching. Regardless of what he does, the 76ers have been through a similar storm before. Last time, Morey patiently waited for the right offer and ended up trading Ben Simmons for Harden - the same path that Harden is now taking.

"If we do end up making a trade, it will have to meet one of these two goals," Morey said in an interview last month. "Either we acquire a player who can help us perform as well as we did last season, or we acquire enough draft picks to build a team that can support Joel Embiid in the future. If neither goal can be met, we'd rather stay put."

So far, no such deal has been made. But it could still happen at the last minute, just like in Simmons' case. Maybe next season, there will be teams like the Bulls who want to start over and are willing to trade for expiring contracts and some role players.

Harden could also become a buyout candidate, or the Clippers could make a bold move mid-season if they see a chance to win a championship.

But the pressure on the 76ers is greater than ever. Whether "The Beard" stays or goes, it will have consequences for the team's salary cap space next season. As more and more teams are approaching the salary cap limit, it's becoming increasingly difficult for teams to go over the hard cap. The 76ers are one of the few teams in the NBA with enough trade flexibility, so any potential deal involving Harden could have repercussions in the next season.

"We want to be one of the strongest teams next season, while also maintaining the flexibility to add a star player in the future," Morey said in an interview. "To become a championship contender and still have the flexibility to acquire a superstar is a unique situation."

Embiid is currently at the peak of his career at 29 years old, so giving up on next season for the 2024-25 season is hard to accept, especially since the 76ers may not find success in the free agency market.

At this point, it would be a win-win for both sides if Harden returns to the 76ers and focuses on playing basketball. Embiid and Harden could form a dynamic duo on the court, and the 76ers know how to handle Harden's habits. It would also increase his trade value, whether it's for the Clippers or other underdogs, or even in the upcoming free agency market.

However, things are not looking good at the moment, and both sides seem to be at a stalemate. The talk of trading Harden may have come to an end, but the end of this soap opera is still nowhere in sight.
