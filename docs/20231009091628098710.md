 A fan of the NBA recently posted a story on Instagram, tagging Damian Lillard and stating that he is the "future legend" of the Miami Heat. Lillard then shared the post on his own story but later deleted it. However, many people were able to capture the moment when Lillard posted the story. According to previous reports, Lillard is expected to only report to training camp with the Portland Trail Blazers or his potential new team. Whether or not he will switch teams before the start of the season remains uncertain, but it could have a significant impact on the overall landscape of the NBA.
