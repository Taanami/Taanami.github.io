  Introduction of Changyao Cup International Teams: South Korea's Bundang Business High School

This year, the Changyao Cup is being held as an international invitational tournament. One of the teams on the roster is South Korea's Bundang Business High School, known as the "Empress of South Korean High School Basketball." They have not only dominated the high school basketball scene in South Korea, but also played a significant role in the development of professional women's basketball and national team players in recent years. Despite being a relatively new team, Bundang Business High School has risen to become one of the top teams in women's basketball in South Korea.

Since its establishment in December 2007, Bundang Business High School has achieved impressive results in various national competitions. In 2010, they won third place in the National Federation of High School Basketball Championship, and in 2011, they won silver at the 92nd National Sports Festival. In the following two years, they swept all major competitions in the high school women's division, and have maintained an unbeaten record in the KSSBF Korean Middle and High School Basketball League for three consecutive years.

As a rising star in South Korean high school basketball, Bundang Business High School has produced numerous national team players and professional players in the past decade. One of their most well-known players is Park Ji-soo, who has been called the "strongest center in South Korean history" and "genius basketball girl." She became the youngest (at 16 years old) women's basketball national team player in South Korean history and was drafted by the Minnesota Lynx as the 5th overall pick in the 2018 WNBA Draft, becoming the second South Korean player to enter the WNBA after Jung Sun-min, who played for the Seattle Storm in 2003. Other players from Bundang Business High School who have made their mark on the international stage include Ban Soo-jung, Ko Na-yeon, and Park Soo-hee, who led the South Korean team to the Round of 16 at the 2021 U19 World Cup. Ban Soo-jung and Park Soo-hee were also drafted as the second and third picks in the WKBL draft last season, earning them the nickname "monster rookies."

As of the first half of this year, Bundang Business High School's women's basketball team has won three consecutive championships in national competitions (the 60th Spring National Middle School Basketball Federation Championship, the 48th Association Chairman Foundation Middle School Basketball Championship, and the 2023 King of Kings Weekend Basketball League). Three players from the current team, Seo Yoo-jung, Park Do-youn, and Ban Ha-jeong, have been selected to represent South Korea in the Changyao Cup. They are also expected to continue to excel in the South Korean high school basketball scene. Recently, it was announced that they will participate in the 2023-24 WKBL draft, making them the center of attention in the national basketball community.

Although Bundang Business High School holds a prestigious position in the South Korean high school basketball scene, they face challenges in competing on the international stage, which cannot be ignored by the country's basketball community. This may also be a barrier that they are determined to overcome in the future. As the world begins to recover from the pandemic, Bundang Business High School is honored to be one of the five international teams invited to participate in the Changyao Cup. The team's coaches stated that this is a significant opportunity for them to not only share and showcase their skills and abilities that have led to multiple championships in South Korea, but also to learn from and gain experience competing against top international teams. They hope that this experience will contribute to the team's development and individual players' future careers.
