 202324 Key Player for Indiana Pacers - Bennedict Mathurin

In last year's draft, this Arizona guard was selected by the Indiana Pacers with the 6th overall pick. With his outstanding natural talent, explosive power, and excellent catch-and-shoot ability, the Pacers have high hopes for him.

At the beginning of the season, he came off the bench and averaged 20.1 points in the first two months, with shooting percentages above 40%. His signature off-ball movement was a nightmare for opposing teams, as he often found open shots with the help of players like Haliburton, TJ McConnell, and Andrew Nembhard. However, as the season progressed and he was given more responsibilities, Mathurin's flaws began to show, particularly in his ball-handling skills. Due to his lack of dribbling ability, he struggled to create his own scoring opportunities. With Haliburton's injury, his passing quality also decreased, resulting in an average of only 15 points per game in the following four months. Although 15 points is still considered good for a rookie, it is not up to par for someone who the Pacers have high expectations for as a potential sidekick to Haliburton (or even potentially the team's future leader).

During his training to improve his ball-handling skills, his three-point shooting, which was once his strength, also suffered, with his shooting percentage dropping below 30%. He often rushed to take shots after receiving the ball, without properly observing the defense and making decisions. As a top scorer, Mathurin still has a long way to go.

Fortunately, after hitting a wall for a few months, Mathurin was able to bring his average points back up to above 19 in April. However, this does not mean that he has overcome his struggles with ball-handling. It simply means that he has returned to his comfort zone, with his AST% back up to 13% (previously below 8.5). This also means that for now, Mathurin should focus on being a reliable off-ball scorer, while his ball-handling skills still need improvement.

Is there a transformation? Let's fast forward to this year's summer league. While everyone is amazed by the transformation of second-year players like Keegan Murray from the Sacramento Kings and Jabari Smith Jr. from the Houston Rockets, I am also excited to see what new skills Bennedict Mathurin will bring to the fans. However, upon watching the Pacers' games, besides seeing Nembhard continue to showcase his amazing passing skills, and Jarace Walker's dominant defense, the rest of the team's performance was lackluster, especially Mathurin's disappointing performance. He often took rushed shots, made mistakes while driving into a crowded defense, and showed no progress in making decisions when facing closeouts from defenders. It is worrisome that Mathurin may end up like former Kings player Ben McLemore, with great athleticism and smooth shooting, but lacking offensive skills on the court.

Mathurin's problems can be summarized into the following points: ball-handling is the key for a player to go from being a role player to a star or even a superstar. Many players who were once hailed as the next big thing failed to overcome this hurdle and ended up as role players or even leaving the league.

Mathurin's biggest problem with ball-handling is his lack of change of pace, coupled with average ball-handling skills, which limits him to only relying on his first step to beat defenders. However, in a league full of athletic players, this is not enough. Therefore, it is common to see Mathurin struggle to beat his defender and end up taking low-efficiency shots.

Another issue is his lack of court vision. After finally getting past the first line of defense, he struggles to read the defense and find opportunities to attack or pass to open teammates. As a result, he often falls into traps set by the opposing team's second and third line of defense, resulting in turnovers or rushed shots.

Lastly, when he does get past the defense and has a chance to finish at the rim, he lacks a reliable finishing move. Compared to his teammates like Haliburton and Nembhard, who may not have the best physicality, they have a go-to move to score when faced with defenders. However, Mathurin lacks this finishing touch, and often struggles to convert at the rim.

Becoming a Key Man

After enduring a tough season and the failed contract negotiations with Buddy Hield, it is almost certain that Mathurin will have more opportunities to start next season, which also means he will have more chances to play alongside Haliburton and Myles Turner. This also means that his ball-handling responsibilities may decrease, and he can focus on his strengths, such as catch-and-shoot opportunities, and even attacking the basket after receiving a pass from his teammates.

However, this is still not enough. I hope that he can continue to work on his flaws during the season and become a key player for the Pacers, forming a formidable offensive trio.
