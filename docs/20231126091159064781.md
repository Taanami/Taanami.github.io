The Final Battle of the Asia Basketball Championship is Must-Win Against Mongolia, Coach Sun Man-Sun Points Out the Key

Special reporter Ji Xiang-Ru / photography related to the key battle for the top spot in the group in the men's basketball competition at the Hangzhou Asian Games, although the Chinese team had the ability to resist the host's tall lineup inside, their perimeter defense was breached, as the mainland team hit 15 three-pointers and eventually suffered their first defeat with a score of 69:89. In the final group match, the Chinese team must win against Mongolia to secure the second place in the group. Team captain Zeng Wen-Ding directly called for a "must-win order", and head coach Sun Man-Sun also pointed out the key points. Sun Man-Sun mentioned that today's opponent, the mainland team, had an absolute height advantage. Throughout the game, the Chinese team focused on protecting the inside, but they missed many defensive rebounds, allowing the host to grab offensive rebounds and convert them into outside attacks. He added, "Our biggest problem is that every player is being marked when we try to create opportunities, so the chances are not so good."

Despite losing by 20 points, Sun Man-Sun still praised the Chinese team's fighting spirit, but there is still room for improvement in defensive communication and rotations. There are 16 teams participating in the men's basketball competition at the Asian Games, divided into 4 groups in the preliminary round. The group winner will advance directly to the quarter-finals, and the second and third place teams in each group will compete for the remaining 4 spots in the quarter-finals. In the Chinese team's final group match, they will face Mongolia, and a win will secure the second place in the group.

The Chinese team doesn't have much knowledge about Mongolia, but they have done their homework based on Mongolia's previous match against the mainland. Sun Man-Sun believes that their opponent will have good mobility and a positive attitude in the next game, and the Chinese team's disadvantage in height today will become an advantage in the next game. To win against Mongolia, they need to defend the rebound well and have a chance to play the Chinese team's strength in transition attacks. Mongolia will face Hong Kong at the same time tonight, and they suffered their second defeat with a score of 64:69, allowing Hong Kong, who replaced Lebanon in the Asian Games, to start with a victory. Currently, both Hong Kong and the Chinese team have a record of 1 win and 1 loss. In terms of strength, it will be difficult for Hong Kong to shake the host in the final match, which means that the Chinese team, who defeated Hong Kong in their first match, has almost secured the second place in the group in advance.
