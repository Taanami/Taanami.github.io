 New Orleans Pelicans forward Trey Murphy underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus on Wednesday during a game, and the results of the evaluation were released today. Murphy has decided to undergo surgery and is expected to miss 10-12 weeks, with a possible return in mid-November. It is certain that he will not be able to join the team for the start of the season. Initial reports stated that there were two ways to treat a torn meniscus, and Murphy chose surgery, which will take a longer time to recover from, affecting the Pelicans' frontcourt strength at the start of the season. Murphy averaged 14.5 points and 3.6 rebounds per game last season, making him a key young player for the Pelicans.
