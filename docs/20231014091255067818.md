Today, the Chinese basketball team lost to the host team, Mainland China, by a score of 69-89, crushing their hopes of securing the top spot in their group at the Hangzhou Asian Games. 39-year-old veteran player Wen-Ding Tseng admitted that the team has shown improvement during their long training period, but "honestly, it's still not enough." Since starting their training in June of this year, the Chinese men's basketball team has gone through training camps in Japan, participated in the Jones Cup, and traveled to Australia for 2 weeks. However, their results at the Hangzhou Asian Games have been disappointing. While they were able to defeat Hong Kong in their first game, their offense faltered in the first half today, leading to a 20-point deficit and ultimately a loss. Tseng, who returned to the national team after a break, bluntly said, "After such a long training period, there is improvement, but honestly, it's still not enough. We need to continue to improve and get better in the limited time we have."

Tseng pointed out the team's problems, mentioning that all of the players are key players on their respective club teams, but when they come together as a national team, they have to adjust their roles and mindset. They must find ways to contribute to the team within the limited time and opportunities they have.

The Chinese team has been hit hard by injuries in the backcourt this year. Starting point guard Ying-Jun Chen was unable to play in the Asian Games due to injury, forcing shooting guard Ting-Qian Lin to step in as the primary playmaker. Despite recording 7 assists, Lin self-critically evaluated his performance as "failing" in his role as point guard. The team will have to reflect on their mistakes and work harder in their next games in the group stage.

At 23 years old, Lin joined the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) draft in 2020 and played for the Tianjin Ronggang Pioneer team. He recently signed a 3-year max contract to stay in Tianjin. Today, he was also a target for Chinese media. Lin mentioned that after 3 seasons in the CBA, he expected there to be high-intensity physical battles in today's game. In reality, there wasn't much difference from playing in the CBA, but the atmosphere at the Asian Games and in the CBA league are completely different. The referees also have different standards, making it a unique experience.
