  The blurred pros and cons of the 2023 World Cup: The United States is merely a strong team, not an invincible powerhouse.

Certainly, before the game against Lithuania, the USA team had already secured a top-two finish in Group J of the second round, advancing to the quarterfinals, and had even secured a spot in the upcoming Paris Olympics. However, by the standards set by the basketball world, the USA team, as the number one basketball power in the world, was expected to be the favored side. But Lithuania refused to give up. They once again put the USA team in a position of falling behind at the start of the game. Unlike the previous five opponents of the USA in the World Cup, Lithuania was different in that they only allowed the USA team to lead for 1 minute and 18 seconds in the first two minutes of the game. Even though the USA team made a strong comeback in the second half, Lithuania did not allow them to make any progress and ultimately defeated the star-studded American team with a score of 110-104, maintaining their undefeated record in the World Cup and handing the USA team their first loss in this tournament.

Since the Rio Olympics in 2016, the United States has failed to maintain a perfect record in their three most recent international competitions. Please continue reading. Of course, we cannot deny that Lithuania was exceptionally accurate in this game. They were already the most accurate three-point shooting team in the World Cup so far. But today, they not only made 6 out of 6 three-pointers in the first quarter, but also made 14 three-pointers throughout the game, with contributions from 9 different players, including their main center Jonas Valanciunas. In the fourth quarter, with 3 minutes and 52 seconds remaining, Mindaugas Kuzminskas made a difficult three-pointer with Anthony Edwards closely defending him, and with 1 minute and 43 seconds left, Tomas Dimsa successfully hit another three-pointer to extend their lead to 11 points. These two crucial three-pointers dealt a heavy blow to the USA team. Strictly speaking, the USA team's defense had almost no loopholes, but Lithuania still managed to score, as if it was meant to be. They ultimately made the USA team's efforts to catch up in vain.

Focusing only on the three-pointers would be overlooking Lithuania's true strength. Center Jonas Valanciunas has always been challenged by NBA teams due to his weakness in defending against high pick-and-rolls. However, under FIBA rules that allow zone defense and allow centers to dominate in the paint, Valanciunas has become a powerful and versatile player with strong low-post offensive skills. Coupled with the synergy and basketball IQ developed from long-term collaboration with the national team, he is a dominant center under FIBA rules. Just like Nikola Vucevic, the main center of Montenegro in the USA team's previous game, both players have shown their brilliance on the FIBA court, allowing the world to see the talent of European star centers. Additionally, Lithuania's shortest player is 6 feet 4 inches, and all their guards have strong defensive abilities. The post players, including Valanciunas, provide solid support and tough defense. Lithuania's strategic positioning and aggressive playstyle, with active movement off the ball and everyone prepared for both offense and defense, make them a formidable force on the world stage, even without the NBA star Domantas Sabonis. Please continue reading. This was fully demonstrated in their competition against the United States. Of course, the unbelievable three-point shooting in the first quarter helped them quickly establish a significant lead. However, the key to Lithuania's victory throughout the game was their aggressive style of play, as mentioned earlier. They established an early advantage in rebounds and off-ball offensive rebounds, with the USA starting lineup, apart from the tall Jaren Jackson Jr. and the strong Edwards, being outmatched in three of the four positions against Lithuania. Even though the USA second unit had Tyrese Haliburton and Brandon Ingram, who are relatively outstanding in terms of physical attributes for their positions, Lithuania always found ways to exploit Austin Reaves with team defense. Lithuania outrebounded the USA with 43 rebounds compared to 27, and had a 17-2 scoring advantage in the second unit. This included Kuzminskas grabbing an offensive rebound and scoring near the end of the third quarter, allowing Lithuania to maintain a safe distance from the USA team's second unit in the fourth quarter. Fortunately, Lithuania had accumulated enough second unit offensive firepower in the first three quarters to maintain their lead. Otherwise, with just one more offensive rebound and score, the USA team's comeback attempt could have been successful. As for the USA, in the preliminary games, to address Ingram's slump, Josh Hart replaced Ingram in the starting lineup, forming a Villanova championship connection with Mikal Bridges and Jalen Brunson. However, this starting lineup was clearly a "one big and four small" lineup with no room for ambiguity. This also indicates that only Edwards was the main offensive threat. Bridges and Hart, although praised in recent years as "functional wing players," or Bridges' offensive breakthrough since joining the Nets making him "more than just a functional player," fundamentally, they are not like Valanciunas, who can dismantle opponents' defense with power in the low post, or superstars like Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, or at least Dwyane Wade, who can score at a high level in elite competitions. Indeed, from the USA team's starting lineup and the selection of the entire team, we can see that the USA has many outstanding functional players. However, in this game against Lithuania, the weaknesses of this lineup were evident.
