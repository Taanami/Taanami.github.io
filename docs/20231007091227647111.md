 Introduction to the Long Yao Cup International Team - Fukushima Commercial High School

When it comes to the Fukushima region in Japan, it is hard to escape the impression of being a "city of sorrow." With past tragedies such as nuclear power and earthquakes and tsunamis, the overall industrial innovation and development in the area have always faced obstacles and hardships. However, this has never affected the local residents' enthusiastic support for sports and its development. Starting with professional baseball, soccer, and basketball teams, Fukushima has always been united in its desire to reshape the established impression of them through sports.

Fukushima Commercial High School is a boys' basketball team that was born in such an environment and spirit. In 2003, Fukushima Commercial High School established its basketball team, led by coach Shinya Mizuno. Coach Mizuno is known for his defensive leadership in organizing attacks. He has not only been the head coach of the Japan U18 high school boys' basketball team in the "31st Japan-Korea-China Youth Basketball Exchange Tournament" organized by China, Japan, and Korea sports associations but has also led Fukushima Commercial High School to the national high school basketball tournament three times between 2003 and 2013, achieving the team's best ranking of 32nd. Coach Mizuno is currently the head coach of the Japan U19 boys' basketball team.

In 2021, Coach Mizuno returned to Fukushima Commercial High School to coach the boys' basketball team, bringing expectations for a second period of team development. In just over three years, Fukushima Commercial High School has established itself as a contender in the high school basketball rookie championship and has successfully advanced to the final four this year. Although the school cannot quickly strengthen its overall competitive strength by recruiting foreign players due to the system of public schools in Japan, in today's international spotlight on Japanese basketball, the focus is on how to cultivate more local players, which is an important aspect that Japanese student basketball players value and hope for. The slogan of Fukushima Commercial High School is to challenge higher stages starting from local competitions.

After the conclusion of the Japan-Korea-China Youth Exchange Tournament at the end of August, Coach Mizuno will lead the Fukushima Commercial High School boys' basketball team to Taiwan. For this team that continues to challenge and grow, Fukushima Commercial High School sees its participation in the Long Yao Cup as an important preparation for the Winter Cup in November. Coach Mizuno stated, "Being able to compete and exchange with players of the same age from various countries is a very valuable opportunity for us." Through international competition, the school hopes to broaden the players' perspectives and improve their basketball skills. The future development of Fukushima Commercial High School is highly anticipated.
