In addition to Goku, the Dragon Ball series introduces the "Great Demon King Piccolo" who protects the Iron Man Restricted Zone. Kaohsiung 17 Live Iron Man signed British center Kavell Bigby-Williams today. Bigby-Williams is 27 years old this year, 211 cm tall, and weighs 113 kg. He was born in the UK and has Jamaican and Dominican heritage. Bigby-Williams specializes in the center position. He has a keen ability to interpret the game and spatial awareness. He can find attacking opportunities by positioning himself well with teammates and is agile and quick in his reactions. He also has the ability to shoot from mid to long-range, and his ability to grab offensive rebounds and make dunks is impressive. His shot-blocking ability is also excellent. Bigby-Williams has represented the UK in U18 and U20 competitions and has delivered an average of "double-double" in U20 games. After graduating, he entered the NBA draft but was not selected by any team. He then played in the NBA G League and competed in various European leagues such as Italy, Belgium, Poland, and France, as well as the Venezuelan professional basketball league. He recently represented the UK in the EuroBasket and the World Cup.

In college, Bigby-Williams attended NJCAA D1 Gillette College, where he achieved a "double-double" in scoring and rebounding in his rookie year. In his second year, he averaged 16.8 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 5.6 blocks per game, earning him the title of NJCAA Player of the Year. He then transferred to NCAA Division I powerhouse Louisiana State University (LSU), where he played alongside NBA center Naz Reid, forming a formidable "twin towers" combination.

In the Dragon Ball series, Goku represents righteousness, while the Great Demon King Piccolo represents evil. With their combination, their energy will be maximized, and Bigby-Williams will become the Great Demon King guarding the Iron Man's restricted zone, utilizing his excellent spatial awareness to create more opportunities on the offensive end.

Head coach Qiu Dazong commented on the addition of Bigby-Williams to the Iron Man's restricted zone, saying, "Bigby-Williams operates between power forward and center on the offensive end, with active and clear offensive skills. He is also able to actively create opportunities for the team. On the defensive end, he has an aggressive and resolute fighting spirit. We hope that Bigby-Williams can lead the Iron Man in both offense and defense and strive for the best results."
