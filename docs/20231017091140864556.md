During the post-game press conference after their quarter-final match against Lithuania, Bogdanović spoke about Borisa's condition. He mentioned that the team had a meeting before the game and Borisa's presence and words united them and played a key role in their victory.

Bogdanović also shared that the team was very nervous before the quarter-final game, with factors such as changing hotels, worrying about Borisa, and the importance of the game. He personally felt extra pressure because he had always lost to Lithuania during his time in the youth team.

However, before the game against Lithuania, Borisa appeared in the meeting to assure everyone that he is doing well and to encourage them to win the game. Bogdanović described this act as a true display of unity and how Borisa's perspective on the situation brought the team together.

Bogdanović also said, "He is truly an incredible person and this victory is also dedicated to him." Serbia beat Lithuania 87-68 in the second half to advance to the semi-finals. Bogdanović led the team with 21 points, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists, with 18 points in the first half alone.
