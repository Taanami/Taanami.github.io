 Steve Kerr's coaching in the playoffs for the first time was defeated by the Western Conference team, the Golden State Warriors are likely to face reconstruction.

According to reports from US media, this is the first time that Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Warriors, has lost to a Western Conference team in the playoffs. This may also lead to a reshuffling of the Warriors' lineup in the future.

Steve Kerr, 57 years old, took over as head coach of the Golden State Warriors starting from the 2014-15 season. Before this series against the Lakers, the Warriors had a perfect record of 19 wins and 0 losses against Western Conference teams in the playoffs. In other words, whenever the Warriors made it to the playoffs, they would always reach the NBA Finals and have won four championships.

Although the Golden State Warriors finished the regular season in 6th place, avoiding the fatigue of playing in the play-in tournament, they still had to fight until Game 7 against the playoff newcomers, the Sacramento Kings, in the first round to advance.

Looking at the Warriors' main rotation lineup, their star player Stephen Curry's contract is not likely to be traded as it runs until 2026. However, Klay Thompson, one of the "Splash Brothers," is likely to be a target for the team.

According to reports from US sports media "Legion Hoops," Thompson will enter the final year of his contract next year, with a salary of up to $43.21 million. Although the Warriors have the priority to extend his contract next year, it has been reported that the team hopes the 33-year-old Thompson can "take a pay cut" to renew his contract.

Furthermore, according to a report from US sports news website "The Athletic," Draymond Green, although having a player option for the next season, must decide before June 30, 2023, whether to exercise it. Although the Warriors are interested in re-signing him, it is not guaranteed that they will offer him a top salary. If Green becomes a free agent, there are still many teams interested in acquiring him. In addition to the three main starters, Jonathan Kuminga, who only played an average of 6.3 minutes per game in the series against the Lakers, also expressed some dissatisfaction.

His agent revealed to the US media "The Athletic" that if Kuminga is not included in the Warriors' future core lineup, he hopes to be traded to a place with more opportunities.

In the Western Conference semifinals of the NBA playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers won against the Golden State Warriors with a score of 122-101, eliminating the defending champions. They will now face the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers, who had a 3-2 lead before the game, outperformed the Warriors in various statistics. LeBron James scored 30 points, 9 rebounds, and 9 assists, while center Anthony Davis grabbed 20 rebounds and scored 17 points despite leaving the game due to a head injury caused by Kevon Looney. Austin Reaves made 4 out of 5 three-pointers, contributing 23 points overall. The Warriors, despite Stephen Curry's 32 points, struggled as Klay Thompson underperformed, and their three-point shooting was only 13 out of 48 attempts. The Lakers led 31-26 after the first quarter and maintained their advantage in the second quarter, with the "Splash Brothers" struggling and Curry and Thompson combining for only 20 points in the first half. Before halftime, Reaves made a buzzer-beating three-pointer, boosting the morale of the Lakers and leading them to a 56-46 halftime lead. In the second half, Reaves continued to make three-pointers, and D'Angelo Russell extended the Lakers' lead to double digits. The Warriors, who have had poor away records this year, saw their morale shaken. With 6 minutes and 20 seconds left in the third quarter, both teams received technical fouls due to a confrontation under the basket, and Lakers' starting guard Dennis Schroder was ejected.

The Lakers entered the fourth quarter with a 91-77 lead, and the Warriors showed some improvement. However, Draymond Green faced foul trouble, and Rui Hachimura of the Lakers blocked Klay Thompson, leading to a 20-point difference with over 8 minutes left in the fourth quarter. The outcome was determined.

As the 7th seed in the Western Conference, the Lakers defeated the 2nd seed Memphis Grizzlies in the first round of the playoffs and eliminated the 6th seed defending champions, the Golden State Warriors, in the second round. They will now face the 1st seed Denver Nuggets on the morning of the 17th Taipei time, making it a rare occurrence in this year's NBA playoffs where both the Eastern and Western Conference Finals have 7th or 8th seeds participating.

Earlier, the 8th seed Miami Heat eliminated the New York Knicks and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals.
