 Introduction to Ohka Gakuen High School, Japan, in the Changyao Cup International Team

In the 2021 Asian Cup Women's Basketball Championship, Japan ultimately defeated China to win their fifth consecutive championship. They also achieved a historic silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics. The "Japanese Sports Promotion Plan," which has been advocated and fully reformed since 2013, has shown significant and even astonishing results in just ten years. Whether it is professional development or student training, it has become a model worth learning from.

Ohka Gakuen, included in this year's Changyao Cup International Team, is an important cradle for the new generation of Japanese women's basketball players.

Ohka Gakuen High School, located in Aichi Prefecture, is often referred to as the "factory for producing Japanese national team players." The team has a long history, dating back to 1980, and has won 71 national championships. They hold records such as the most championship wins in the current Japan Winter Cup (24 times), the highest single-game score in the women's division (139 points), the most championship wins in the Inter-High basketball competition (25 times), and 22 championships in the National Sports Festival basketball competition for high schools, including a five-year winning streak from 1992 to 1996.

One of their famous achievements is the legendary score of "268:0" against Toyake High School in the 2014 Inter-High Aichi Prefecture regional qualifiers. Ohka Gakuen, the stable powerhouse of Japanese high school women's basketball, has broken the stereotype of Asian basketball players having inferior physical attributes with their flexible and innovative playing style. They have not only achieved outstanding results in national high school basketball but have also nurtured many representative players in Japanese professional basketball. In recent years, they have produced international basketball stars, including WNBA Seattle Storm's former center Maki Takagawa, the main center of the silver medal-winning team at the 2020 Olympics, as well as players such as Miho Miyoshi, Evelyn and Stephanie Makuwa, and former WNBA Phoenix Mercury player and newly announced inductee into the FIBA Hall of Fame, Masako Oshikawa.

Ohka Gakuen has a rich international competition experience. In the past, they participated in the Grandmother's Cup in Taiwan in 2017, winning the championship with five consecutive victories, and the Yangming Cup International Women's Basketball Invitational in 2018, establishing a deep friendship between Japan and Taiwan. This year, they are once again coming to Taiwan and their roster for the Changyao Cup includes team captains Kokoro Kurokawa and Shin Tanaka, as well as "Asian prodigy" center Lingna Fukuoka. In addition, four freshmen, Nana Nagahamada, Mina Abe, An Kawakawa, and Sakura Yamada, and Nanaiko Tanagura, who defeated Taiwan's young women's basketball players by 47 points in the U16 Asian Youth Championships this year, are all key players. It is highly anticipated what kind of "education" this lineup with extensive international competition experience will bring to Taiwanese women's basketball players.

Ohka Gakuen's basketball team has expressed their anticipation for participating in international exchange competitions once again after the pandemic. They are looking forward to seeing and absorbing the strengths of various countries, and then internalizing them to create a more competitive "new Japanese playing style." As the current leader in domestic high school basketball, whether they can ascend to become a cradle for student players with greater representation and influence in the international basketball world may be a goal and milestone that can be expected.
