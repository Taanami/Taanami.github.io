  2023 TGF Fire Fighting Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview - Wu Bo Lin, Rain

This year, the senior team from the northern district, represented by Wu Bo Lin, Rain, made it to the FINAL 4 of the national tournament. Among them, Tsai Jing Zhou, who won both the assists king and steals king in the finals, is also a representative of TGF alumni. This time, they gathered players from different universities such as Shih Hsin, Yun Tech, Taitung, and National Sports University, and even NCAA players. After winning the runner-up in the northern district, they made it to the finals of the national tournament. For them, basketball is like a remote control. TGF represents their home, and they all share this remote control to turn the TV to the most interesting and suitable program for them. Just like how they find the most comfortable rhythm as a team in TGF. Please continue reading.

This year, the team participated in TGF as senior players, which is different from the past. Tsai Jing Zhou said with satisfaction, "There is a feeling of cherishing everything. It is not easy to set up a stage, because we are playing on a stage that others have built. If it were us, the feeling would be completely different. So I cherish it even more, and can only express it with cherishing!" Please continue reading. 

TGF has given them a feeling of bringing together players from different regions to compete, which is very exciting. Each region also has its own style, not just in terms of basketball skills, but also in the interactions on and off the court. As the name suggests, TGF is about passing on and sharing this stage, enjoying it and cherishing it! Compared to single-school and cross-school teams, it is more challenging for the senior team to gather together, but everyone is willing to come together from all over the world during summer vacation to play basketball, which is something worth remembering. Whether in the future as teammates, opponents, or colleagues, it is a deeper connection. The basketball game may end, but the bond between each other will not. Looking forward to the next time we meet, may we all take a step closer towards our dreams. Please continue reading.
