 NBA Beast Mistaken for KD Beast in IG Response: Actually, I'm Rick James

NBA players are often recognized by fans off the court, and the ones who are most frequently teased are Rajon Rondo, Chris Paul, John Wall, and Kemba Walker. While many people may not think they resemble each other, another player is often brought up when discussing these players. Earlier today, Dwight Howard, also known as the Beast, posted a photo with a fan on Instagram. Some netizens mistook him for Kevin Durant of the Suns, and the caption read, "OMG, I met @KDTrey5 last night, he's such a nice person!" The Beast responded, "She mistook me for Kevin Durant?" In the IG description, he added, "I told her I'm Rick James," along with disappointed and crying face emojis. The video showed his exasperated expression. Rick James was a popular singer-songwriter from 1964 to 1990, but he passed away in 2004.
