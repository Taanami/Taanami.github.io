 What does "小鐵如擬宇宙政大耀武揚威之外跨聯盟邀請賽表達了什麼" express?

With sharp weapons, iron is like mud. With a sharp wind, "小鐵如擬" (a team name) emerges. We hope to have more discussions and share various opinions on the games. In the 2023 cross-league invitation game, the undefeated "政治大學" (a university name) finally met their match and suffered their first defeat with a score of 98:70. 

"政治大學" has maintained a perfect record, sweeping the UBA court for three consecutive years and aiming for a fourth consecutive victory this academic year. It might be interesting or even exaggerated to describe this university team as defeating adult-level and professional teams before winning three consecutive victories in the cross-league event. If someone wants to manipulate the situation by saying that a "university team" defeated a "professional team," it may attract attention and overshadow the performance of professional Taiwanese basketball. However, recent trends have shown that such deliberately manipulated media headlines are being criticized. Nevertheless, we can still acknowledge the strength of "政治大學." Many events that have occurred during this cross-league tournament are worth discussing in terms of the Taiwanese basketball market and the development of Taiwanese players.

Advantages of Team Formation and Integration

The reputation of "宇宙政大" (a nickname for "政治大學") is well-deserved. No matter how you look at it, "政治大學" has won three consecutive victories in style. In these three games, they first defeated the stable veteran team "臺銀" (a team name) by 11 points, then easily defeated P. LEAGUE+ training team and T1 League "台新戰神" (both team names), winning a total of 70 points. These three victories showcased "政治大學's" outstanding performance, leading people to say that they initially thought "政治大學" challenging the adult battlefield as a university team was like "jumping levels to fight monsters." However, based on these three games, "政治大學" seems more like that "monster" that other participating teams find it difficult to contend with.

Let's take a look at the terrifying statistics of "政治大學" in the previous academic year's college basketball league. Among the sixteen teams in the UBA first division, only three teams had an average score exceeding 80: "政治大學," "健行" (a team name), and "世新" (a team name). "政治大學" and "健行" both exceeded 90, but "健行" had an average score of 90.5 per game, while "政治大學" had a higher average score of 95.1. This means that even in a situation where three teams already have outstanding offensive firepower, "政治大學" can still surpass the other two powerhouses.

Furthermore, "政治大學" has an average score below 65, with a score of 61.8. Their team assists are also the highest among all teams with 24, while the second-place "健行" only has 18.6. "政治大學" commits an average of 12.4 turnovers per game, being the only team with fewer than 14 turnovers. Although "政治大學" may not excel in offensive rebounds compared to "世新," they still lead in team rebounds among all schools. They are not particularly outstanding in three-point shooting percentage (eighth) and free throw shooting percentage (ninth). In short, although "政治大學" may not sweep all the statistics, they are at the forefront or even ahead of other teams in most of the categories in the college league. There is an obvious gap between them and other teams in terms of their strengths in attack, team defense, and ball movement.

"政治大學's" head coach, 陳子威, said that they have arranged many games during the offseason, which has been a physical test for the team. However, he hopes that they can reflect on areas they need to improve in different games. For "政治大學," participating in the cross-league tournament was an opportunity to break away from the college-level competition and experience a higher level of competition. They have shown impressive performances so far, proving that they have the ability to face various challenges.

The main reasons for their success may be that they approached the cross-league tournament as university students, without any psychological burden. Even if they lose, no one will blame them. Another reason is that this cross-league tournament allows foreign students but does not allow registered foreign players. Therefore, only "臺銀" registered 聶歐瑪, "台啤" registered 蓋比, and "柏力力" registered 蘇格爾. On the other hand, "政治大學" has the advantage in terms of size and strength, boasting the "strongest foreign students in history," 莫巴耶, who won the MVP in a previous tournament, and the physically dominant 波波卡, who may have some room for improvement in technique but is difficult for other local players to contend with. In terms of interior strength, "政治大學" is undoubtedly the strongest team in this tournament.

In addition to "臺銀," which mostly consists of their main lineup, the other teams either formed a coalition for this tournament or have mostly young players with less than three years of experience. "政治大學" has the advantage of having played together for many years. Therefore, in terms of team integration, "政治大學" is definitely at the forefront of this tournament.

In the game against the P. LEAGUE+ training team, in the third quarter, the main point guard of "政治大學," 游艾喆, made a brilliant behind-the-back pass to his junior, 鄒子羲, for a dunk. It was undoubtedly the best play of the tournament so far. In addition to this impressive pass, 游艾喆's passing vision, organizational skills, overall court progression, and handling of fast breaks have all shown improvement compared to the previous UBA season. He is undoubtedly the most impressive star point guard of the tournament so far. 宋昕澔 (another player) has also continued his good performance from previous games, showing aggressive attacking skills. "政治大學" has demonstrated outstanding performance in this tournament, receiving strong evaluations, which is reasonable based on their known capabilities.
