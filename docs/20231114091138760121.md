Tomorrow, the NBA will have a total of 14 games as there was no game today due to the US election. One of the most anticipated matches will be between the Rockets, who have won three consecutive games, and the Lakers, who have lost four consecutive games, with Dillon Brooks and LeBron James facing off against each other.

In an interview the day before the game, Dillon Brooks stated that he is ready to shut down LeBron James. He knows that LeBron is in good shooting form and is playing well, so his goal is to make him feel tired and fatigued early in the game. Brooks' performance against the Lakers this season and in last season's playoffs has been drastically different, currently averaging 16.3 points per game with a shooting percentage of 59.3% and a three-point shooting percentage of 56.5%. LeBron, in his 21st season, continues to perform at a high level with an average of 25.3 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game.

Tomorrow's game will be the second time these two teams meet, with the Rockets winning 112-108 in their last match. Brooks contributed 26 points in that game, while LeBron had 27 points, 8 rebounds, and 7 assists. This makes tomorrow's game a rematch between the two stars, adding to the excitement for fans. Hopefully, Brooks can continue his excellent performance and lead the Rockets to a fourth consecutive win, while LeBron can maintain his consistent performance and help the Lakers get back on the winning track. The matchup between these two players will be the biggest highlight of tomorrow's game, so let's wait and see.
