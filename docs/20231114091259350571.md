In preparation for the new season of East Asia Super League (EASL), New Taipei King announced on September 22nd that they have signed Asian import player Hayden Blankley. The 23-year-old rookie from Bay Area Dragons, who joined the professional league in 2022, will join the team to challenge PBA league and showcase his skills in the upcoming season. Born in New South Wales, Australia, Hayden stands at 198cm and played college basketball for NCAA Division II team West Texas A&M University. In 2022, he joined Bay Area Dragons in Hong Kong and played in 24 games, averaging 13.4 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game with a 40.3% three-point shooting percentage. He also had an impressive performance of 47 points with 10 three-pointers made in a single game, helping Bay Area Dragons to reach the runner-up position in that season. In the previous EASL season, Hayden played in 3 games, contributing 9.7 points, 4 rebounds, and shooting 53% from beyond the arc. His excellent physical condition and shooting ability caught the attention of Australian NBL1 team Bendigo Braves, where he currently plays with an average of 21.9 points and 10.8 rebounds per game. His outstanding shooting skills and flexibility in off-ball movements will be an advantage for Hayden in his professional career. 

After joining New Taipei King, Hayden will compete in 6 group stage games in EASL, aiming to help the team advance to the top 4 and achieve better results. General Manager Mao Jiaen said, "We noticed Hayden's playing style when he challenged PBA last year and it fits our team's defense strategy very well. With his height and versatility, he can cover positions 2, 3, and even play as a substitute for position 4. He is a team player and doesn't dominate the ball, which will greatly benefit our team in creating offensive space. With many experienced guards on our team, we believe Hayden will be a strong weapon for New Taipei King in the EASL."
