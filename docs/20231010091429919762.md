 NBA reporter Shams Charania revealed that LeBron James is ready to participate in the Paris Olympics and has recruited several superstars, including Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry.

LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry have discussed their plans to participate in the Paris Olympics next summer. They are prepared to compete in the games alongside Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum, and Draymond Green. Additionally, Devin Booker, Damian Lillard, De'Aaron Fox, and Kyrie Irving also expressed their desire to represent the United States.

According to Shams, LeBron's decision to join the Paris Olympics was made before the start of the World Cup, regardless of the team's performance. The US team's failure to win a medal in the World Cup for two consecutive tournaments serves as a warning for the United States. The challenge for USA Basketball in the coming year will be how to secure their fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal. LeBron James did not participate in the past two Olympics (Rio 2016, Tokyo 2020) but has previously represented the United States in three Olympics (Athens 2004, Beijing 2008, London 2012), winning two gold medals and one bronze. He also won a bronze medal in the 2006 World Cup.
