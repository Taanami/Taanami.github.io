 Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic made history as the first player in NBA history to record 250 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in just five games. Doncic scored 51 points in a close 126-125 victory over the San Antonio Spurs, extending the Mavericks' winning streak to six games.

Doncic, born on February 28, 1999, is a Slovenian professional basketball player who plays as a point guard for the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA. In 2017, he won the European Basketball Championship with the Slovenian national team, becoming the first championship in the country's history and earning a spot on the All-Tournament Team.

In 2019, Doncic was named the NBA Rookie of the Year, and he has since been selected to the All-NBA First Team three times. In recent games, Doncic achieved an incredible triple-double with 60 points, 21 rebounds, and 10 assists in an overtime win against the New York Knicks. He followed it up with another triple-double of 35 points, 12 rebounds, and 13 assists against the Houston Rockets.

With his 51-point performance, Doncic has now scored over 50 points in three of the last five games. He also becomes the first player in NBA history to record 250 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in just five games.

Christian Wood, the center for the Mavericks, expressed his amazement, saying, "It's unbelievable. In my seven years in the league, I've never seen anyone do what he does. His performance is like that of a Most Valuable Player (MVP), and he is clearly one of the strongest players in the league."

Wood contributed 25 points in the game, while Tim Hardaway Jr. and Spencer Dinwiddie scored 14 and 11 points, respectively.

For the Spurs, Keldon Johnson led the team with 30 points, followed by Jeremy Sochan with 20 points. Jakob Poeltl recorded a double-double with 19 points and 15 rebounds, and Tre Jones and Zach Collins scored 18 and 13 points, respectively. The Mavericks had a 17-point lead at one point but almost let the game slip away. With 3.6 seconds left, the Spurs had a chance to tie the game as Jones was fouled and awarded two free throws. After making the first free throw, Jones intentionally missed the second, but the Spurs failed to capitalize on the opportunity.

With the Mavericks leading by only one point, Doncic missed both free throws with 1.5 seconds left, giving the Spurs a chance to stage a comeback. However, Doncic grabbed the rebound after missing the second free throw and ran out the clock, securing the Mavericks' one-point victory.
