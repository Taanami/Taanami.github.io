In a post announcing his addition to Aomori Watari, Liu Chun-ting expressed his excitement to join the team and play with everyone. He also mentioned that Aomori's apples and rice are famous in Taiwan and he looks forward to trying all the local delicacies and bringing some back to Taiwan. In a video posted on Tainan TSG Ballers' social media, Liu Chun-ting mentioned that he had a trial in Aomori last month and was impressed by the team's serious attitude. He hopes to improve in all aspects while playing for the team. In his rookie season two years ago, Liu Chun-ting joined Tainan TSG Ballers through the draft and received a lot of playing time. However, in his second year, the team added many veteran players and his playing time decreased significantly, averaging only 1.2 points and 0.6 rebounds per game. The Japanese B.League started just last weekend and Aomori Watari has already won two games in a row. Last season, Aomori Watari made it to the playoffs as the eighth seed in B2 but was eliminated in two straight games.
