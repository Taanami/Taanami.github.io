 The NBA league announced the suspension of Josh Primo, a player from the San Antonio Spurs, for four games due to inappropriate behavior. Following the announcement, the Los Angeles Clippers immediately signed Josh Primo to a two-way contract.

After being evaluated by the Clippers' advisors and team management, Primo was given another chance. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, Primo will continue to receive treatment and is expected to spend most of his time in the G-League, where the Clippers will develop him as a player. The NBA investigation found that Primo engaged in inappropriate and offensive behavior by exposing himself to a woman. Primo stated that his actions were unintentional, and the subsequent league investigation did not find evidence linking these brief exposure incidents to sexual misconduct or inappropriate behavior.
