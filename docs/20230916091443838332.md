# The Miami Heat and the Portland Trail Blazers are expected to resume trade negotiations for Damian Lillard 
 The Miami Heat and the Portland Trail Blazers are expected to resume trade negotiations for Damian Lillard. The Heat are currently hesitant about including Caleb Martin in the package. Caleb Martin had a good performance in the Eastern Conference Finals this year, helping the Heat defeat the Celtics in the series.

According to reporter Shams Charania, Damian Lillard is expected to only report to training camp with either the Heat or the Trail Blazers. However, according to Blazers reporter Aaron Fentress, Charania's statement is only partially correct. Fentress mentioned that if the Blazers reach a trade agreement with another team, Lillard would go to his new team and give his best performance. Fentress also reported Lillard's inclination towards joining the Heat, but his stance has become less firm since the league got involved in the negotiations.
