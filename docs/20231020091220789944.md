 PLG Flying Ape Coaching Team Strengthens Again, Ma Yihong Serves as Assistant Coach

Tao Yuan Puyuan Flying Ape announced today (10/11) that they have strengthened their coaching team with the addition of former national basketball player Ma Yihong, who will be a member of the team's coaching staff in the upcoming season. Ma Yihong was a player for Chunghwa Telecom and Taiyuan Women's Basketball Team in the WSBL (Women's Super Basketball League) and was also a key player for the national team. She has also played for the Heilongjiang Women's Basketball Team in the WCBA (Chinese Women's Basketball Association) in the past. After retiring in 2015, she served as an assistant coach for the National Taiwan Sport University men's basketball team and an assistant coach for the Taiwan Steel Hawks, never slackening in her pursuit of self-improvement and learning as she transitioned from a player to a coach.

Regarding her new role as an assistant coach for Tao Yuan Puyuan Flying Ape, Ma Yihong said, "Courage is not the absence of fear, but knowing that the decision we make is more important than our fears." She also added, "As I embark on this new journey, I hope to bring a different perspective from a female point of view. I am happy to join the Flying Ape family and look forward to the upcoming season."

In addition to Ma Yihong, Flying Ape also announced the recruitment of Lin Weiting, a master's student in physical education from Taiwan Sport University, as the team's sports science coach. Lin Weiting has extensive research and practical experience in the field of sports science, and will assist the team in using scientific knowledge more effectively in training and games.

Flying Ape General Manager Zhang Zongxian said, "We are delighted to have Ma Yihong and Lin Weiting join our coaching team. They are both excellent coaches with rich knowledge and experience in basketball, and will bring more strength to the team in future games. We will continue to strengthen our coaching team and lay a solid foundation for the team's development."

Flying Ape will once again challenge the PLG Flying Ape Super Basketball League with a new lineup in the upcoming season, and we believe that the new coaching team will lead the team to even greater achievements.
