New Orleans Pelicans forward Trey Murphy suffered a meniscus injury during a game on Wednesday and immediately underwent evaluation and treatment. Today, the results are in, and Murphy has decided to undergo surgery for the injury. He is expected to be out for 10-12 weeks, with a possible return in mid-November. It is now confirmed that he will miss the start of the season. 

Initially, there were two options for treating the meniscus injury, and Murphy has chosen surgery, which requires a longer recovery time. This will have an impact on the Pelicans' frontline strength at the beginning of the season. 

Last season, Murphy averaged 14.5 points and 3.6 rebounds per game, making him a key young player for the Pelicans.
