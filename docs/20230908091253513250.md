  Aggressive Leadership Qualities of Dennis Schroder and Germany's Unfinished Mission in the 2023 World Cup

The preparations for the previous EuroBasket tournament clearly had an impact on the present. Maxi Kleber refused to represent the national team in order to fully prepare for the NBA season, which led to public criticism from Dennis Schroder.

A year later, despite Kleber expressing his desire to participate, the comments made by the "leader" of the German national team still hurt him, making him feel unwelcome and reluctant to express his stance to the national team head coach, Gordon Herbert.

Please continue reading about Germany in the FIBA World Cup - Previous Tournaments and Best Performances: Germany has participated in the World Cup a total of seven times, but they have only reached the semifinals twice, with their best result being a bronze medal in 2002. In that tournament, Dirk Nowitzki had an outstanding performance (24 points, 11 rebounds), but Germany was still defeated by Argentina in the semifinals. In the battle for third place, Nowitzki once again contributed with 29 points, leading Germany to victory against New Zealand.

Four years ago, Germany ambitiously participated in the FIBA World Cup, but they suffered a major setback as they were eliminated in the first round by the Dominican Republic. Please continue reading about their path to qualification: Germany unsurprisingly qualified for the FIBA World Cup this year.

They only lost one game in the first phase (5 wins, 1 loss), which was against Estonia in the first round. In the second part of the qualification, they maintained their dominance and finished with a total score of 10-2, securing the first place. Please continue reading about the key players: Perhaps this may sound a bit critical, but the current team's leader seems somewhat misnamed due to his own behavior, as the criteria for becoming a leader is recognition from others rather than one's own opinion. However, Dennis Schroder is undoubtedly the most important player, and without his outstanding performance in the previous World Cup, Germany would not have been able to win the bronze medal.

Perhaps on the court, this has never been an issue, but when an important player in the lineup decides not to help the national team due to the leader's public statements, it becomes a big problem.

In addition, the Wagner brothers have already proven themselves to be reliable. Last year, Schroder and Franz Wagner were bronze medal winners in the EuroCup. Moritz Wagner couldn't participate due to injury, but he had an outstanding performance in the Olympics two years ago. Johannes Thiemann and Johannes Voigtmann, as two experienced European league players, should not be overlooked, and Isaac Bonga can defend all positions from one to five.

All three of them can threaten opponents from the outside. If we add Daniel Theis' size and abilities inside, it won't be easy for opponents to gain an advantage against Germany in the paint.

Maodo Lo in the backcourt will be the backup plan when Schroder is off the court, as he has proven his scoring ability multiple times.

However, the most anticipated C&S player is Andreas Obst. Despite missing most of last season due to injury, Obst is now healthy and ready to provide his strongest weapon to the national team, which is three-point shooting.

In this aspect, he is undoubtedly one of the best players in the European league. The head coach, Gordon Herbert, is of Canadian descent and has had a successful coaching career.

He has led multiple professional teams, including three terms with Frankfurt. In 2004, he led them to win the German Bundesliga and was awarded the Coach of the Year in 2016 for the same team.

Furthermore, Frankfurt also won the FIBA Europe Cup in that season. He has also worked with the Canadian coaching staff and served as an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors, as well as the coach of the Georgian national men's basketball team.

He took on the role of head coach for the German national team in 2021. In the first significant game, he led "Die Mannschaft" to win a medal at the EuroBasket for the first time in 17 years.

Currently, they have a perfect record in the preliminary round and have high expectations of winning the gold medal. We will soon find out if this team can achieve great results in the World Cup.
