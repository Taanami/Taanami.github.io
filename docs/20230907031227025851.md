 Introduction to Bundang Business High School, the Korean High School Empress

This year, the Changyao Cup is being held in the form of an international invitational tournament. Among the international teams, Bundang Business High School from Korea, also known as the "Korean High School Empress," has gained a reputation for its dominance in the Korean high school basketball scene. It has also played a significant role in the development of professional women's basketball in Korea and the nurturing of national team players. Despite its relatively short history, Bundang Business High School has quickly risen to become one of the strongest women's basketball teams in Korea. Since its establishment in December 2007, it has achieved remarkable success, including a third-place finish in the 2010 National Federation Chairman Basketball Championship and a silver medal in the 92nd National Sports Festival in 2011. In the following two years, it won gold medals in various major competitions in the national high school women's division. Currently, Bundang Business High School continues to maintain a three-year undefeated record in the KSSBF Korean Middle and High School Basketball League.

As one of Korea's emerging star high school women's basketball teams, Bundang Business High School has produced numerous national team and professional players in the past decade. Among them, Park Ji-soo, known as the "strongest center in Korean history" and the "basketball prodigy," stands out. She became the youngest (16 years old) female national team player in Korean history and was selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the 5th overall pick in the 2018 WNBA draft, making her the second Korean player to enter the WNBA after Jung Sun-min, who played for the Seattle Storm in 2003.

Furthermore, in the 2021 U19 Women's Basketball World Cup, key players who led Korea to the round of 16, such as Byun Soo-jung, Ko Na-yeon, and Park So-hee, also come from Bundang Business High School. Byun Soo-jung and Park So-hee were even selected as the second and third overall picks in the previous WKBL draft, earning the reputation of "monster rookies." Park Ji-soo, who also graduated from Bundang Business High School, is considered one of the most promising female basketball players in Korea in recent years.

In the first half of this year, Bundang Business High School's women's basketball team has already achieved a three-peat in national tournaments, including the 60th Spring National High School Basketball Federation Championship, the 48th Association President's Middle School Basketball Championship, and the 2023 King of Kings Weekend Basketball League. The current players who have secured their spots in the Changyao Cup roster are Heo Yu-jung, Park Do-won, and Byun Ha-jung, who was recently awarded the FMVP of the King of Kings tournament. They are highly regarded in the development of Korean high school women's basketball and have also made headlines with their participation in the 2023-24 WKBL draft.

Although Bundang Business High School holds an influential position in the Korean domestic basketball scene, overcoming the challenge of achieving higher rankings on the international stage remains a crucial task for Korean basketball at all levels. This is also a threshold that Bundang Business High School aims to cross. Today, as international competitions resume after the pandemic, Bundang Business High School has been invited to participate in the Changyao Cup as one of the five international high schools. The coaching staff of Bundang Business High School considers this a significant opportunity, not only to showcase their championship-winning skills and abilities developed domestically but also to share and learn from talented players from other countries. They hope to accumulate more international game experience for their players and provide them with greater support for future individual development.
