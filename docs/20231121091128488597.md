 NBA star Joel Embiid has announced his decision to play for the United States in the 2024 Paris Olympics. In a recent post on his 'X' platform, Embiid discussed his reasons for choosing to represent his home country, stating that he is proud to call both Cameroon, France, and the United States his homes. After discussing with his family, he ultimately decided to join his NBA brothers and play for the United States, as well as for his fans who have supported him since his first day in America. However, the most important reason for his decision is to honor his son, who was born in the United States, and let him know that his first Olympics appearance is dedicated to him. Embiid, who averaged 33.1 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game last season, has solidified his position as a superstar in the league and beat out Nikola Jokic to win the 2022-2023 season MVP award.
