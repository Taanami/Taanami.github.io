  SBL2023 New Draft Picks: Su Ge'er as the First Pick, Jiang Haowen as the Second Pick, and Guo Zhenfu as the Third Pick

The SBL (Super Basketball League) held its new draft pick event today. The Changhua Bank team selected foreign player Su Ge'er as the first pick. Taiwan Beer chose Jiang Haowen as the second pick, and Taiwan Cooperative Bank selected Guo Zhenfu as the third pick. The fourth pick went to the Yulon Luxgen Dinos, who chose Wang Yifan.

Su Ge'er, the first pick, is from Mongolia and has played for three schools in the UBA (University Basketball Association). During his time at Zhongzhou University, he led the team to the semifinals and defeated Fu Jen Catholic University to win third place. Last year, he studied at the CTBC Financial Management College and won the championship in the UBA Division 2.

He also became the first foreign player in SBL history to be selected as the first pick. Taiwan Beer selected Jiang Haowen as the second pick. He attended Gao Yuan Vocational High School and studied at National Taiwan Normal University. He plays as a point guard, standing at 175 cm tall, with an average of 8 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 1.9 assists per game in college.

Guo Zhenfu, chosen as the third pick by Taiwan Cooperative Bank, attended Yilan High School and studied at National Kaohsiung Normal University. He plays as a forward, standing at 190 cm tall, with an average of 13.1 points and 6.8 rebounds per game in college.

Previously, he was selected by the Taichung Suns in the second round of the T1 draft, and his future moves are also worth paying attention to. Yulon Luxgen Dinos chose Wang Yifan as the fourth pick. He attended Neng Ren Commercial High School and studied at Fu Jen Catholic University. He plays as a point guard, standing at 173 cm tall, with an average of 7.5 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game in college. Like Guo Zhenfu, he was also selected in a professional league (PLG draft, Hsinchu Street Ball Lions, second round, first pick). It is also worth noting which team he will choose to join in the future.
