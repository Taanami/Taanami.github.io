Exploring Denver Nuggets' Path to Defending their Title in the 2023-24 NBA Season

Looking back at the 2020-21 season, the Nuggets made a mid-season trade with the Magic for Aaron Gordon, elevating their team to new heights after reaching the Western Conference Finals in the bubble.

However, things took a turn for the worse when star player Jamal Murray suffered an Achilles injury during a regular season game against the Warriors, forcing him to miss the entire season. The Nuggets also struggled with injuries to another key player, Michael Porter Jr., making it difficult for Jokic to carry the team on his own. As a result, they fell short in the playoffs.

But perhaps the Nuggets' patience with their players' injuries paid off, as they proved to be a dominant force in the regular season. They held onto the top spot in the Western Conference and were able to rest their players towards the end of the season. In the playoffs, they swept the Lakers and "gentleman swept" the Heat in the Finals, bringing home their first championship in franchise history since 1967-68. 

Now, as the team looks ahead to the new season, they have some changes in their roster and will need to adapt to remain competitive. Let's take a look at some key changes and factors to watch for.

Due to their limited salary cap space, the Nuggets were not able to retain key players like Bruce Brown, who was crucial in bolstering their front line last season. Brown had the highest defensive win shares (DWS) of 2.6, second only to Jokic, and his defensive prowess was invaluable for the Nuggets, especially with Murray and Porter Jr.'s weaker defense. However, Brown ultimately signed with the Pacers for a 2-year, $45 million deal.

With most of their key players locked into long-term contracts, the Nuggets had limited flexibility in the free agency market. They were only able to sign Reggie Jackson from the Clippers and Justin Holiday to add depth to their front line. But will these moves be enough to fill the void left by Brown's departure and maintain their competitiveness? 

Reggie Jackson will likely serve as insurance for the second unit, but his declining offensive efficiency may limit his playing time. In fact, he saw a decrease in minutes during the playoffs and had a career-low effective field goal percentage (eFG%) of 45.7% in his 16 games with the Nuggets. 

This opens up opportunities for rookies like Jalen Pickett, who was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the draft. Pickett has shown promise in scoring and playmaking abilities, and his solid three-point shooting in college (38.1%) may earn him playing time in his first season. 

Furthermore, with Vlatko Cancar out due to an Achilles injury, the Nuggets will need to find a suitable replacement for the power forward position when Gordon is off the court. Zeke Nnaji, who spent 77% of his playing time at the center position last season, may have to step up and fill in the gap. Other options include rookies Hunter Tyson and Julian Strawther, but both have their limitations. Tyson lacks defensive skills, while Strawther needs to improve his reading on defense and physical condition to earn playing time.

One of the biggest challenges for the Nuggets in the past few seasons was Jokic's inconsistency in the playoffs. However, last season, he proved to be not only a dominant force on the court but also a stable leader. In the playoffs, Jokic averaged 26.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 5.2 assists in 33.8 minutes per game, and he was able to step up in crucial moments to lead the team to victory. With Jokic's leadership and a strong core lineup, the Nuggets will continue to be a formidable team in the upcoming season.

In conclusion, although the Nuggets did not make any major moves this summer, they have a stable leader and a strong core lineup, making them a force to be reckoned with in the new season.
