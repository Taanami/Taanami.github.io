  Creating Miracles: Anthony Gill on the Necessary Qualities for Secondary Talents to Enter the NBA

The path to the highest level of basketball, the NBA, is different for every player. Some are blessed with natural talent that makes it clear they will become NBA players, even stars. Others must put in a lot of effort to establish themselves, while many struggle and face countless obstacles to achieve their dream of playing in the NBA.

For Wizards player Anthony Gill, hard work and an open mindset were the key to his journey to the NBA.

Making it to the NBA is not just difficult, but almost impossible for the vast majority of basketball players.

With only about 450 players in the entire world reaching the highest level of the NBA, the odds are about 0.01% for basketball players around the globe.

As fans, we often see young players with great potential on draft night, but for most players, it is a harsh reminder of the reality they face.

For many, draft night is an eager anticipation of dreams coming true for young athletes, but for others, it is a harsh reality check. The majority of players who go undrafted are forced to explore all options, some choose to go to summer league and hopefully earn a contract, or at least a chance to play in the G-League. Some choose to go overseas and play in unfamiliar environments, with the possibility of taking years to earn their ticket to the NBA. These stories often go unnoticed, even if they do succeed, it is not always a glamorous journey.

"In the US at least, no one plays basketball to make money overseas," says Gabe York, who is currently playing in the G-League. Gill agrees, having spent a total of four seasons playing in Europe after going undrafted in 2016.

"I never thought about leaving the US to play basketball during college," says Gill. "From the beginning, our goal was always the NBA, from high school to college, everything was geared towards the NBA." Now 31, Gill has played in the NBA for four years since the Wizards signed him in 2020 after his time in Europe with Khimki Moscow. While Gill's journey to the NBA was atypical, it is not uncommon. Every year, a large number of talented college players go undrafted and choose to continue their career overseas. Gill also made it to the NCAA Elite Eight with the University of Virginia, but after the season, he faced the harsh reality of the draft process. "If you were to ask me when I went from being ambitious to being forced to be realistic, I would say it was during the entire draft process," says Gill. On draft night, Gill watched his teammate Malcolm Brogdon get selected by the Bucks in the early second round while he went undrafted. He still did not think about going overseas.

"After the draft, I still did not consider going overseas," says Gill. But after discussing with his agent Sean Kennedy, he began to realize that the NBA was not the only option for him. "He told me that it was very likely that I would not make it to the NBA and I would have to work extremely hard for a slim chance."

However, the young Gill was not ready to accept that and making the decision to go overseas was not an easy one. "I remember constantly thinking whether I should take $25,000 to play in the Knicks' G-League or go to Germany and make $100,000," says Gill. One of the key factors in his decision was that he was already married and had to support himself financially. So he decided to go to Europe, but little did he know that reality would strike again. "I got cut after just five days in Germany. I participated in one practice and I thought I did well, but they still cut me," recalls Gill. "I thought, am I really going to fly back like this? I felt embarrassed, even Europe didn't want me. What should I do? Will anyone still want me? I even thought about just getting a regular job." Fortunately, Kennedy helped Gill find a team in Turkey.

Gill took his agent's advice and worked extremely hard, believing that if he gave it his all, better opportunities, even the NBA, would come knocking on his door.

He also enjoyed immersing himself in the overseas lifestyle. "In my first year of marriage, we lived in a country where not many people spoke English, so we could only talk to each other. It actually made our relationship stronger," says Gill. He believes that having an open mindset is crucial to succeeding overseas. "When you go to different countries, you have to adapt. Every culture is beautiful, and if you think from an American perspective, it will be difficult and hard to get along. I enjoy making friends with local players and immersing myself in their culture." Gill also uses language learning apps like Duolingo, Babbel, and others, but the best way to bond is through basketball.

"One time, I played one-on-one with 11-12-year-old kids in Turkey. We didn't have much conversation, but basketball was the best way to communicate," says Gill. "Now, I tell other players with less talent, if they have the chance to play overseas, they should never give up that opportunity and fully experience the local culture."

Gill's first season in Turkey was impressive, averaging 14.4 points and 6.9 rebounds per game with a 47% field goal percentage. During the offseason, he became a free agent and once again, his hopes for the NBA were reignited. However, his agent advised him against it again. "If I went to the NBA at that time, I would only have a 2-week training camp and at most, a 10-day contract."

Gill did not want to go back overseas. "I wanted to go back to Europe. I also knew that I could make some money in Europe." Gill played for two seasons in Turkey before moving to Israel, then back to Turkey, and finally Russia, where he had impressive performances in each stop. In 2020, he finally got his chance in the NBA.

"When I saw that the Wizards were dealing with injuries, I knew I had a chance," says Gill. "I knew I had a chance, but I also knew that I could fail. But I still chose the NBA because it has always been my dream." In his first NBA season (2020-2021), Gill averaged 5.5 points and 2.8 rebounds per game with a 44% field goal percentage. This season, he has improved to 7.5 points and 3.9 rebounds per game with a 59% field goal percentage.

"Every time I play in the NBA, it is a miracle," says Gill. "Not everyone can make it to the NBA, and I am grateful to be here, but I know this is not the end and I still need to keep working hard." Gill is currently with the Wizards, but he knows that his next destination may be another country. "I don't know where I will end up next, but I know I still need to keep working hard," says Gill.
