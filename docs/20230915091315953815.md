  Zhixuan Qiu, the touchstone of the Chinese men's basketball team at the World University Games, demonstrates his strength and style.

In this year's World University Games, Zhixuan Qiu, the power forward of the Kaohsiung Family Mart Sea God basketball team, shoulders the responsibility of the frontline. Not only does he show great skills in both offense and defense, but he also possesses a dominating presence on the court, once again proving his nickname as the "God of War." Benefiting from the opportunities he gained last year due to injuries within the team, he displayed explosive offensive energy that was difficult for opponents to resist. With his agility, decisive positioning, and shooting ability, his future looks promising.

Please continue reading ▼ Although he did not win a championship, it is undoubtedly the biggest regret for Zhixuan Qiu. Whether it was in Dongshan High School, Yishou University, or the professional league, he has always been unable to personally touch the championship trophy. He earned the nickname "Dongshan God of War" in the HBL, leading his team to the top four and achieving the best record in team history. After studying at a university in the United States, he returned to Taiwan and joined Yishou University in 2020. With his impressive performance, he decided to challenge the professional league boldly.

In the second season of the T1 League draft, he was selected in the first round by the Kaohsiung Family Mart Sea God team, allowing him to stay in the familiar environment of southern Taiwan and reunite with his college coach, Yujuan Xie.

The head coach of the Sea God, Brendan Joyce, is not afraid to use rookies, so Zhixuan Qiu quickly became a key player coming off the bench. His versatile offensive skills and speed make him the focal point of the team's change of pace. In the game against the Yunbao team on December 4, he scored an astonishing 31 points, 3 rebounds, 4 assists, and 2 steals in just 27 minutes, displaying sharp and accurate attacks without fear even when facing foreign players. In the second half of the season, the team's frontline suffered from injuries, providing him with the opportunity to showcase his talents. He did not disappoint, although his shooting percentage needs improvement, he solidly contributed points and became a key player in changing the team's momentum. Throughout the season, he averaged nearly 20 minutes per game, with 7.7 points, 3 rebounds, and 1.2 assists, making him the only competitor to Wei-Jia Gu in the Rookie of the Year race.

Of course, for the Sea God team defending their title, they faced many challenges and were eliminated in the first round by the Hawks. However, nurturing future star Zhixuan Qiu has made the team's frontline strength even stronger, and Lin Renhong and Wu Xiaojin will no longer be isolated. He, along with Su Wenru and Lu Weiting, were selected to represent Taiwan in this year's World University Games, and all three of them performed well. With their ability to score inside and outside, although they are not as tall as their opponents, they can become pillars of the Chinese national team and grow through exchanges with top players from around the world.

Please continue reading ▼ As seen from the perspective of the author, Zhixuan Qiu is one of the most consistent players, apart from Ai-Zhe You and Jinwei Gao. He was set as a starting player from the beginning. Except for the games against Lithuania and Japan, he scored in double digits in all other games. In the game against China, he frequently tore through the defense, grabbed 9 rebounds, and punished opponents in one-on-one situations. In the ranking matches against South Africa and Poland, his performance as a corner three-point shooter was outstanding, making it difficult for opponents to defend against both inside and outside attacks. In addition, his defense is also impressive. Even though his skills may not be sufficient, he compensates with his determination. He performs well in the areas of wide zones, the second and third zones, and individual defense. He had 11 steals in 6 games, leading to several fast breaks, accurately showcasing Coach Mengzhu Liu's fast-paced style.

Zhixuan Qiu averaged 10.6 points, 3 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 1.8 steals per game. His playing time increased with each game, highlighting his importance. Although he is only 190 cm tall and may not have any advantages against European and American powerhouses, his sharp and fearless shooting makes him the first player to break through limitations for the Chinese national team. Together with You and Gao, they constantly disrupt the opponent's defense with their cutting, providing crucial speed and impact, just like in their professional league encounters.

Seeing his performance reminds me of Lin Zhijie in the early stages of his career. They have a similar height but exude a dominating presence on the court. They both have a fearless attitude in both offense and defense, which is the courage that young players should have, truly deserving the title of "God of War." In terms of offense, his shooting mechanism is stable, his three-point shooting is accurate, and he is selective and composed in his shot choices. His understanding of tactics and positioning inherits the characteristics of players produced by Yida, making him a player with a team-oriented style. He has speed when cutting and a soft touch when finishing at the rim. Although his main attacking method is facing the basket, he has enough energy and agility. Of course, young players still need to put in the effort. Once caught in a double-team or on the sideline, mistakes are likely to occur. His ball-handling skills need improvement, but his offensive and defensive awareness and execution are impressive, making him a reliable player.

▼ "Holding the ball" as a future lesson, let the God of War dominate the court. Zhixuan Qiu is actually a player with a good shooting touch. It wouldn't be a bad option for him to transition to shooting guard or focus on shooting. However, he did not choose this path and instead became a versatile forward. Although his movements and finesse still need improvement, I believe this is the key to finding a unique position for him in the future. Moreover, all professional teams lack forwards who can attack with the ball. Most of them need guards or centers to receive or pass the ball to score. If he can develop diverse offensive skills, he could become one of the players who can provide firepower for the frontline.
