  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the rising star who fluctuates like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, faced off against Luka Dončić in an intense international game.

Sharp as a weapon, cutting through iron like mud. Precise as the wind, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander resembles a force to be reckoned with.

Let's continue reading to discuss and share various perspectives on the game. The score was 100:89 in favor of Canada against Slovenia in the quarterfinals of the 2023 World Cup. Canada has made significant progress in recent years in the world basketball arena, reaching the semifinals of the World Cup (including its predecessor, the FIBA Basketball World Cup) for the first time in its history, and crushing Slovenia's dreams of reaching the semifinals. The biggest pre-game focus and post-game topic undoubtedly revolved around the world's number one star, Luka Dončić. Prior to the game, people were wondering whether Dončić, who was expected to be a candidate for NBA MVP in the upcoming season, could dominate and lead a complete Slovenian team to achieve their best international performance and even strive for the championship in the highly competitive World Cup. However, after the game, the focus shifted to his early ejection from the game due to two technical fouls he received.

This was evident in most situations during the game where Dončić created collisions but the referee did not blow the whistle. Subsequently, Dončić showed various expressions of dissatisfaction towards the referee, but his efforts to get the calls he wanted were in vain.

To be honest, in this quarterfinal game, Canada did seem to have a slight advantage in terms of the calls. Dončić may have had reasons to complain, but he paid the price for his complaints with technical fouls. Despite the team's efforts and the final score being only 4 points behind at the time of Dončić's ejection, Slovenia was left without their ace for the remaining half of the game, which hindered their comeback.

Dončić can be considered a loser both in appearance and reality, while Canada's ace, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, can be considered a double winner. He performed exceptionally well, and Canada secured a victory, achieving a new milestone in the team's history. The first meeting between these two players in an international game resulted in mixed emotions, with one rising and the other falling, which is perhaps something that few people would have expected.

However, at the age of 18, Dončić was already a rising star capable of shouldering the responsibility of being the team's leader. People noticed that he was another basketball prodigy from Europe who attracted attention at a young age, following in the footsteps of Ricky Rubio from Spain. Since that EuroBasket, Dončić has soared onto the world stage and received significant attention at the 2018 NBA Draft. If it weren't for Deandre Ayton, who was a perfect fit for the Phoenix Suns as the number one pick regardless of position or background, Dončić could have challenged for the top spot. Ultimately, he was selected third and joined the Dallas Mavericks through a trade. Since then, no one has been able to stop Dončić from shining on various basketball courts. In his rookie year in the NBA, he averaged 21.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 6.0 assists, showcasing his versatility. In his five-year career, these numbers have only increased, and this season he has reached the extraordinary level of "30-8-8". In terms of the world stage, there is no doubt that Dončić has taken over from Dragić and become the absolute core of Slovenia's self-built system. In this year's World Cup, with the absence of Nikola Jokić from Serbia, Giannis Antetokounmpo from Greece, and other top American players, Dončić recorded averages of 26.3 points (the highest in the tournament), 6.8 rebounds, and 6.5 assists, living up to his reputation as the tournament's number one star.

Please continue reading. In terms of statistical performance, there is really nothing to question about Dončić. The term "golden boy" has been appropriate for him since he rose to fame at a young age and remains so today. The problem lies in the increasing number of instances in recent years where Dončić has been seen arguing with referees, which has gotten him into trouble. In the past three seasons, Dončić has ranked in the top three in technical fouls in the league, surpassing the league's threshold of 16 technical fouls that result in a suspension. In this World Cup quarterfinal game, his ejection from the game was not only due to two technical fouls, but also because of his expressions of dissatisfaction towards the referees, including counting money gestures, implying that the referees were being bribed and unfair. Although the referee's officiating may not have been ideal, Dončić's actions were definitely not acceptable and could be considered as a "blemish" for him.

Of course, objectively speaking, Slovenia may not have been the most favored team to win the championship. The only reason there was some expectation surrounding them was because of Dončić. Having such a superstar raises hopes of him creating miracles. However, miracles did not happen this time, and Slovenia failed to reach the semifinals. Looking at the results, it may not necessarily be a disappointment, but the way Dončić swallowed defeat, coupled with his ejection from the game, is reminiscent of the 2021 NBA Playoffs second round, where the MVP that season, Jokić, was ejected from the game due to a malicious foul when his team was trailing 0-3 and helplessly watched his team get swept.
