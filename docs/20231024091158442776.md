In the second quarter, Zhang Zhenlin made a jump shot, and Wang Zhelin scored in fast breaks and pick-and-rolls. Zhao Rui also hit a three-pointer, helping China expand their lead to 14 points. The Philippines made several turnovers on offense, giving China multiple opportunities for fast breaks and allowing them to maintain their lead and enter halftime with a 48-30 advantage. In the second half, CJ Perez of the Philippines scored inside, and Zhao Rui and Hu Jinqiu completed a pick-and-roll to score. With Justin Brownlee and CJ Perez's consecutive scoring, the Philippines cut the deficit to 12 points, prompting China to call a timeout.

 In the final quarter, Wang Zhelin scored inside again, but Justin Brownlee hit a bank shot three-pointer and a 45-degree three-pointer, bringing the deficit down to six points. Zhu Junlong made free throws to stop the bleeding for China, but Brownlee once again hit a three-pointer to reduce the deficit to five points. Zhao Rui responded with a three-pointer of his own, pushing China's lead back up to eight points.

 Hu Mingxuan was then called for a foul for violating sportsmanship during a scramble, and the Philippines hit a three-pointer following Scottie Thompson's two missed free throws, cutting the deficit to four points. Both teams continued to score, but Du Runwang hit a three-pointer after Thompson's free throws, giving China a seven-point lead and forcing the Philippines to call a timeout. After the timeout, the Philippines committed a violation on the inbound pass, and Zhao Jiwei and Hu Jinqiu completed a pick-and-roll for two more points for China.

 Zhao Jiwei then missed two free throws, but Brownlee, facing Zhu Junlong's defense and almost losing the ball, made a tough shot to bring the Philippines within five points.

 The Philippines then successfully defended, and Brownlee hit another three-pointer to bring the deficit down to two points. The Philippines then defended successfully again, and Brownlee, relying on his individual ability, hit another three-pointer to complete the comeback and take the lead. China called a timeout.
