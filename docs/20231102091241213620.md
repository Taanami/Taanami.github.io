  Interview with the Cutest Sports Anchor, Li Yi-Han

Li Yi-Han, who currently works as a sports anchor on ELTA TV, recalls her first time hosting an event at an outdoor basketball game in Taoyuan. The game used ANGO's innovative "light-up ball," which amazed her and left a deep impression of the brand. During her time at Videoland Sports, she saw ANGO's sponsorship of the Taiwan Enterprise Football League, where teams like Taiwan Power and Tatung wore ANGO jerseys. This sparked her interest in getting to know ANGO and discovering that it is not just a sports equipment manufacturer, but also a developer of high-quality jerseys for both football and basketball, providing athletes with more diverse options. Read on to find out what happens when a new generation sports anchor meets a new generation sports brand and jersey, and what kind of new imagination it brings to the sports industry and Taiwan's athletic scene.

As a long-time sports anchor, Li Yi-Han has always been interested in sports, starting from high school where she played basketball and even joined her university's basketball team. Her first job after entering the workforce was as a sports journalist, showing her close relationship with sports. Therefore, she has a unique perspective when it comes to the influence of sports brands.

"I know that this year's JHBL (Junior High Basketball League) has collaborated with ANGO, where they sponsored customized jerseys, warm-up gear, and socks for the players. I think this is a great thing. It not only means that JHBL has gained recognition, but also shows that more people will see the strength of Taiwan's sports brands, creating a mutual support and benefit."

Having experienced playing basketball during her school years, Li Yi-Han understands the importance of sponsorships and encouragement for student teams. This is why she highly praises ANGO's efforts in supporting grassroots sports, such as providing balls and jerseys.

Although ANGO initially focused on the football market, they have recently expanded into the basketball scene, providing high-quality jerseys for more athletes to perform at their best. Despite the expansion, ANGO maintains an environmentally-friendly manufacturing process, which impresses Li Yi-Han and shows the brand's determination in protecting the environment.

Just like how a perfect jersey not only focuses on the athletes but also the entire industry and manufacturing environment. If a brand can also have a friendly attitude towards the environment, it not only benefits the sports industry but also helps the Earth.

A jersey not only represents a team, but also a spirit. Having reported countless sports events, Li Yi-Han chose to enter this industry not only because of her curiosity and admiration for TV work but also her passion and love for sports. She has come a long way to where she is today, even earning the title of "Cutest Anchor," which reflects her genuine enthusiasm and professionalism towards her work.

Enthusiasm and determination are essential sports spirits. "I think work is just like sports, where you must continuously improve your professionalism and skills." Li Yi-Han has a serious and determined attitude, even though she has become a celebrity due to her anchor role, often being scrutinized and facing online criticism. She is willing to change her mindset and continue to challenge herself. "My next goal is to improve my skills in broadcasting sports events, especially hoping to have the opportunity to cover more basketball events that I love, and one day, I hope to report live from the Olympics."

Li Yi-Han has a clear goal in mind, and her eyes light up when she talks about it, as if she is about to make a perfect shot. Despite the cold and wet December weather, let ANGO's hat T-shirts warm your heart.
