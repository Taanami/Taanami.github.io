The Hsinchu City Lions team announced today the reinforcement of their inside power with the signing of Daniel Ochefu.

Ochefu will wear the number 32 jersey for the upcoming season and will join the team's training this week. He will also travel to Singapore with the City Lions this Friday to participate in the 2023 FIBA Intercontinental Cup Singapore Exhibition Tournament. Ochefu, 29 years old and 211cm tall, hails from Baltimore, USA.

During his college years at Villanova University, Ochefu played alongside current USA team members Mikal Bridges, Jalen Brunson, and Josh Hart, leading their team to win the school's second NCAA championship in 2016. In his senior season, he averaged 10 points, 7.5 rebounds, and an impressive 63% field goal percentage. After going undrafted in the 2016 NBA Draft, Ochefu joined the Washington Wizards for the Summer League and eventually signed with the team. Though he didn't see much playing time in the NBA, Ochefu made a name for himself in the 18-19 season playing for the Sacramento Kings' G League affiliate team, the Stockton Kings. He averaged 15 points and 9 rebounds per game, becoming a key player in the team's inside game. While this will be Ochefu's first time playing in Taiwan, he is no stranger to Asian basketball. After playing in the Spanish league in 2019, he also has extensive experience playing in Asian leagues such as the Japanese B.League, Korean Basketball League, and the East Asia Super League representing PBA Philippines' team, the TNT Tropang Giga. Ochefu said, "I am very familiar with the Asian style of play. Compared to other countries, centers have more opportunities to shine in Asia. I am looking forward to the upcoming season!" After adding Brandon Brown as their first foreign player earlier this year, the City Lions have now welcomed their second foreign player. General Manager Zhang Shuren said, "We have watched Ochefu's game footage from the past few years and noticed that he is always aware of his teammates' positions before making a move. This characteristic and his playing style align with our team's strategy for this year."

Zhang also believes that Ochefu will play a crucial role in the team's chemistry between local and foreign players, saying, "Ochefu is easy-going and gets along well with his teammates. He is also willing to adapt to the coaching staff's tactics."

Head coach Lin Guanlun sees Ochefu as a scoring and playmaking big man and believes his familiarity with Asian basketball will help him blend in with the team and strengthen their inside game.

In addition to winning an NCAA championship, Ochefu also won a league title with a team in Venezuela in 2023. When asked about the key elements of a championship team, Ochefu said, "A strong playoff team needs to have good chemistry. Players must get along on and off the court, and the team must prioritize teamwork to have a chance at the playoffs." The City Lions named Ochefu "O Lai Fu" in Chinese, which sounds like his last name, but also has a deeper meaning in Chinese culture. Ochefu revealed, "My teammates used to call me 'Chef' because of my name." After spending several years playing overseas, Ochefu has also enjoyed learning about different cultures. He happily said, "I really like this Chinese name because it also carries the meaning of Chinese culture. I hope to hear everyone chant 'O Lai Fu' in the Hsinchu home arena in the future!"
