Former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal made an appearance on a show today to share his thoughts on the Lakers' current season, as well as to comment on LeBron James' 21st season. He expressed that LeBron's performance is still excellent and he wants to push the record for most points in history even higher, to a level that no one can break within the next 60-70 years.

First, O'Neal shared his thoughts on the Lakers' biggest competitor, the Nuggets, saying, "The key is not to close the gap with the Nuggets, but to defeat the defending champions. They did what they were supposed to do and now they are the champions." He added, "I think Nuggets head coach Michael Malone said it well. The Lakers and Nuggets are not enemies. We won't live in what happened four months ago. This is a new season. To become champions, you have to beat the defending champions."

Regarding LeBron's performance this season, O'Neal even joked about his own last season, saying that every star player's last season is usually a far cry from their previous performance, while he joined the Celtics to chase his fifth championship. "But LeBron is different. He is one of the few players in history who has a consistent playing style and performance. This season, he looks great. He also holds the record for most points in the league's history. He definitely wants to push this record to a level that won't be broken for the next 60-70 years. I know what he is doing," O'Neal said.
