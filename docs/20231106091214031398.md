  "After the SBL match-fixing scandal, Wu Jiying speaks up for the first time and is willing to cooperate with the investigation and accept any punishment. Wu Jiying apologizes for setting a bad example and expresses his willingness to cooperate with any investigation and accept any punishment from the team. According to Mirror Weekly, Wu Jiying, who played for the SBL Yulon Luxgen Dinos last season, is suspected of participating in match-fixing and cooperating with the head of the group to place bets. He could earn at least 300,000 to 500,000 NT dollars for one game. It was also rumored that Wu Jiying was in a romantic relationship with Yulon Group's "Little Princess" Yan Pei-yu. In a bizarre twist, he even sold two of the three precious watches owned by former Yulon chairman Kenneth Yen, causing great dissatisfaction among the higher-ups and prompting them to buy back these watches.

After the incident, Wu Jiying posted a limited-time story on his IG, saying: Wu Jiying's limited-time story. Photo/courtesy of Wu Jiying's IG."
