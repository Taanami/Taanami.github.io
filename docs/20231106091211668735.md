 In a game between the Denver Nuggets and the Memphis Grizzlies, during the third quarter, after a foul was called on Grizzlies' player Xavier Tillman, Nikola Jokic quickly inbounded the ball from the half court to his teammate Aaron Gordon, completing an "out-of-bounds" alley-oop. The Grizzlies' coach called a timeout immediately after. The Nuggets ultimately won the game, with Jokic recording a near triple-double of 22 points, 12 rebounds, and 7 assists, while Jamal Murray also scored 22 points and had 5 assists. Six players from the Grizzlies scored in double figures, but Jaren Jackson Jr.'s last-second shot did not go in, and a foul on the following possession allowed the Nuggets to secure a four-point lead and ultimately win the game.
