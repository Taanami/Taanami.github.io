  2023 TGF World Firefighting Cup Basketball Tournament - Exclusive Interview with Xinmin High School

Xinmin High School from Taichung is a team composed of basketball enthusiasts who train independently after school. They emerged as a dark horse in the district preliminaries, defeating strong opponents and clinching the runner-up position in the central region. With a majority of freshmen and sophomores, they have shown great competitiveness this year, always delivering powerful blows to their opponents in crucial moments. Although they did not advance to the group stage of the national tournament, their strength should not be underestimated. 

To understand why they are described as a dark horse, it is important to note that all teams in the national tournament had to overcome the challenges of unfamiliar venues and environments. Despite these difficulties, Xinmin High School showed unwavering determination. In the group stage, they put significant pressure on their opponents. In the first match against the current national champion, Zhiping High School, they narrowly lost by four points. They also achieved a big victory against Jingwen High School and had a close match against Kaohsiung Vocational High School, losing by only six points. This demonstrates their ability to compete against strong teams from different regions.

The theme of the TGF Cup is inheritance and sustainability. Although Xinmin High School has a majority of freshmen and sophomores, they rely heavily on the guidance of their senior players. The seniors expressed that the younger players have higher talent and physical abilities than them. They hope that the younger players will continue to work hard and help the team secure a spot in the South District of Taichung, looking forward to a better ranking in the next TGF Cup. The team captain, Lin Yukai, plays a crucial role in stabilizing team morale. He leads the team to break through difficult situations and his most memorable game was the district preliminaries against Dajia Industrial High School. The match went into double overtime, but with the team's collective efforts, they emerged victorious, securing a spot in the top four and earning the runner-up title. Lin Yukai was also selected as one of the tournament's best five players. As the captain, he has learned the importance of listening to different opinions and discovering each player's suitable role on the court.

After graduation, Lin Yukai will pursue his dream of attending a police academy, embarking on the next journey of his life. The rest of the younger players will also continue to improve themselves, carrying the expectations of their seniors. Whether they can achieve their goals in the league and how far this dark horse can go in the future is something worth looking forward to.
