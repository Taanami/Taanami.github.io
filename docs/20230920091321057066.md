  The North Carolina Years of Jordan: The Portrait of Jesus Wearing NIKE

In the previous review, we continued reading about the portrait of Jesus wearing NIKE - Michael Jordan's time at North Carolina. Michael Jordan earned himself a starting position on the North Carolina team through his skills and abilities. In that year, the Sports Illustrated magazine requested Dean Smith to have four of the starting players featured on the cover of their preseason special issue, excluding Michael Jordan. Smith explained to Jordan that he hadn't achieved enough to be on the cover yet, unlike his teammates who had already proven themselves.

As a result, the magazine cover only featured Sam Perkins, James Worthy, Matt Doherty, and Jimmy Black. However, when North Carolina won the NCAA national championship that season, the entire starting lineup, including Michael Jordan, appeared on the cover. During Jordan's time at North Carolina, there were limited opportunities to witness his amazing offensive talents due to the lack of basketball game broadcasts and the team's focus on teamwork. The legend of Jordan's skills primarily spread through word of mouth, from scouts, assistant coaches, basketball journalists, and hardcore North Carolina fans. They would say they had witnessed Michael Jordan's incredible moves at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill or how he dominated opponents in various games.

Some claimed that Jordan, who stood at 6 feet 1 inch, could out-jump opponents who were 5 inches taller than him. Others said he was 6 feet 8 inches tall and had the ball-handling skills of Magic Johnson. There were even stories of Jordan seemingly defying gravity and staying in the air longer than Julius Erving during a slam dunk. Dean Smith was pleased with Jordan's progress. He worked hard and was an excellent learner. However, Jordan still had areas to improve, such as his consistency in mid-range shooting, especially when opponents focused on guarding Worthy or Perkins, leaving Jordan open.

In the 1981-82 season, North Carolina once again reached the Final Four of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. They defeated the University of Houston, which would later produce legendary stars Clyde Drexler and Akeem Olajuwon (later known as Hakeem), with a score of 68-63. In the final, North Carolina faced the formidable Georgetown University. It was considered a dream matchup of the two strongest teams in college basketball. Some fans even saw it as a racial matchup, with Dean Smith being white and John Thompson, the head coach of Georgetown, being black. However, Smith and Thompson were good friends. Both led strong teams and emphasized punctuality and graduation for their players. Although Georgetown had more players from economically disadvantaged backgrounds compared to North Carolina, the game was not about race.

Georgetown's star player was center Patrick Ewing, who was tall, strong, and fast. His mobility surpassed many taller college players, making him a terrifying force on both offense and defense. However, the experienced North Carolina players were not intimidated. While Georgetown had the advantage in physique, North Carolina had confidence and excelled in pre-game preparations. They were a cohesive and complete team. On the court, Georgetown relied on five physically dominant players to apply full-court pressure defense for 40 minutes. North Carolina countered with excellent team passing and clear roles. Ewing, perhaps too aggressively, tried to block every shot from North Carolina players, resulting in him being called for goaltending five times in North Carolina's first nine field goal attempts.

In this game, James Worthy was outstanding, scoring 28 points on 13-of-17 shooting. He was strong, fast, and had a keen sense of the game, whether he had the ball or not. Jordan had not yet displayed the same level of sharpness in offense as Worthy, but he grabbed 9 rebounds and faced opponents like Ewing without fear. With North Carolina leading 59-58 in the final minutes, Dean Smith instructed the team to slow down the pace and use up as much time as possible. However, Jordan saw an opportunity. He dribbled into the paint, with Ewing quickly switching to defend him. Jordan switched the ball from his right hand to his left hand and released a high shot to avoid Ewing's outstretched hand. The trajectory of the ball was higher than a typical layup and appeared as if it would go out of bounds behind the backboard. However, the ball smoothly descended from its highest point and gently dropped into the basket, leaving Roy Williams, sitting on the North Carolina coaching bench, initially concerned that the shot would go out of bounds.
