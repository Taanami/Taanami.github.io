Lin Bingsheng, who has recently been involved in contract disputes, made a buzzer-beating three-pointer at the end of the quarter to give his team the lead. In the second quarter, Atino started to show his dominance, shooting 100% from the field and scoring 11 points, often collaborating with Zeng Xiangjun in the paint, causing trouble for the UAE's defense.

Zeng Xiangjun also contributed 6 points in the quarter, including one three-pointer. In the second half, Liu Zheng came off the bench and scored 11 points, helping the Blue Team maintain a lead of more than 15 points.
