NBA player Grant Williams from Dallas Mavericks was interviewed by the media and shared about his experience with Jayson Tatum's son, Deuce, in the locker room.

During one of the away games against the Miami Heat, Williams went around the locker room giving high-fives to his teammates. However, Deuce ignored Williams' invitation and followed Tatum out of the room, and this wasn't the first time it happened.

"There's no bad blood between me and Deuce," Williams laughed. "He's like my little brother, that's just our relationship." 

"It's funny because Deuce is growing up and he's starting to talk more. One day, Tatum and I were together and Deuce was there too. I said to him, 'Bro, you're going to kindergarten now. You're getting bigger, and soon you won't see me anymore.' " 

"Then Deuce replied, 'You're going to the Mavericks because I'm going to kindergarten?' " 

"Leaving Deuce behind makes me sad. It's weird when kids grow up because they act like they don't like you, but I know he'll miss me."
