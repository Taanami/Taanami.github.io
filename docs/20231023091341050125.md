PLG Season 4 Pre-Season Analysis: Taipei Fubon Braves

The Taipei Fubon Braves, also known as the Universe Battleship, are back for another season. After a rollercoaster first half of the previous season and the return of veteran players in the second half, they managed to secure the championship title and complete a three-peat in the PLG league.

This season, the Braves have once again recruited multiple talented players with the goal of achieving a four-peat. Let's take a closer look at their team and their chances for success.

The stability of veteran players: As the saying goes, an elderly person in the household is like having a treasure. The Braves have at least three veteran players who continue to be unstoppable forces on the court. Beast Lin Chih-chieh is still a dominant presence and has shown time and time again in the playoffs why he is the number one player in Taiwan.

Jet Zhang Zhongxian's sharp drives and consistent performance prove that he still has the ability to dominate the game. And veteran player Tsai Wen-cheng has shown that he can efficiently score when given playing time, even hitting a game-winning shot.

As long as these three players are on the Braves, they will be a formidable team to beat. The emergence of mid-generation players: As seen in the previous season, mid-generation players such as Zhang Wen-ping and Hsieh Tsung-jung often play the role of unexpected heroes, helping the team secure crucial victories.

Everyone surely remembers Zhang Wen-ping's impressive three-point shot in the championship series that helped the Braves win a crucial game. Hsieh Tsung-jung's performance in the paint was also impressive. If they continue to get playing time this season, they could contribute even more to the team's success.

The rise of rookies: The most exciting aspect of the Braves is the emergence of their young players. This season, Jian Ting-zhao, Hong Kai-jie, and Chen Fan-bo-yan all showed promising performances on the Chinese White Team.

Jian Ting-zhao and Hong Kai-jie, as the first and second pick for the Chinese White Team, had impressive performances in the Jones Cup, especially Jian Ting-zhao's control of the pace of the game and Hong Kai-jie's ability to drive to the basket. Chen Fan-bo-yan's performance is also worth praising. Despite starting on the bench, he impressed the coaching staff with his accurate three-point shooting and solid defense, earning him a spot in the starting lineup.

Chen Fan-bo-yan's incredible talent was already evident in last year's physical tests, and given time, he will surely become a key player for the Braves. Another two promising young players who made it onto the Chinese Blue Team are Zhou Gui-yu and Tseng Hsiang-chun.

Tseng Hsiang-chun, a 205cm tall center with a three-point shot, has impressive athleticism and was selected for the Chinese Blue Team, proving his skills. Zhou Gui-yu's lockdown defense on Manny Harris in the championship series was also impressive, and he ultimately made it onto the 18-man roster for the Chinese Blue Team.

Zhou Gui-yu's improvement this season is evident, with a more consistent shot, defensive pressure, and ability to drive to the basket, showcasing his potential. With more playing time next season, he will surely reach his full potential.

The torch has been passed onto the young players, and the Braves' fans can't wait to see them shine. Re-signing of foreign players: The Braves have also brought back all three of their foreign players this season. These players' individual skills speak for themselves, and their chemistry with the team sets them apart from other teams' foreign players. This is a significant advantage for the Braves.

For example, in the semi-finals against the Yulon Dinos, the main player was Ater Majok. But in the championship series against the Taiwan Beer, Coach Hsu chose to pair Johnson with Cuthbert, and they successfully won the championship. This proves that these three foreign players have great chemistry with the team and are crucial to the Braves' success.

Off-season reinforcements: This off-season, the Braves first drafted 197cm power forward Cai Zhen-yue, a physically gifted player. They also signed a new foreign player, Shimon, who has been impressive in his highlight reels, showcasing his athleticism.

But the most significant reinforcement comes from Dreamers, with the signing of Wu Yung-sheng, a national team level point guard. He fills the gap left by last season's reliance on forwards to handle the ball and will surely integrate well with the team under Coach Hsu's leadership.

The best coach in the league: It's impossible to talk about the Braves without mentioning their coach, the self-proclaimed best coach in the league, Hsu Chin-che. He is known for his versatility in tactics and player rotations.

He has a keen eye for the game, both on and off the court, and can make quick adjustments. In the previous season's championship series, Coach Hsu perfectly showcased his skills. He used different players in different situations and still managed to get them to perform well, proving why he is the best coach in the league. The only concern: The Braves' only concern is injuries. We must admit that as players age, they become more prone to injuries.

The Braves will also face this problem, but their overall team strength is solid, with almost no weaknesses. As long as they can protect their players and not overwork them, they have a good chance of avoiding injuries and securing a four-peat.

In conclusion, the Braves have a strong team with a good mix of veterans, mid-generation, and young players, along with an excellent coaching staff. They are likely to maintain their leading position and achieve a four-peat this season. Let's look forward to seeing the Braves continue to shine in future games!
