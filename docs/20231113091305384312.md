 After the NBA announced the suspension, the Los Angeles Clippers immediately signed a two-way contract with Josh Primo. According to ESPN reporter Adrian Wojnarowski, the league announced earlier that the San Antonio Spurs player Josh Primo would be suspended for four games (for inappropriate exposure behavior), and the Clippers announced that they would sign Primo with a two-way contract. After consulting with the team's advisor and evaluation, the Clippers gave Primo another chance. Wojnarowski also mentioned in the report that Primo will continue to receive treatment with the team and is expected to spend most of his time in the G-League, where the Clippers will develop him as a potential player.

The NBA investigation found that Primo had engaged in inappropriate and aggressive behavior by exposing himself to a woman. Primo claimed that his actions were unintentional and subsequent league investigations did not find evidence of these brief exposure incidents being related to sexual situations or misconduct.
