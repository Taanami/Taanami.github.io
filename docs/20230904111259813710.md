 The recent activities of the Phoenix Suns have been quite active during the offseason. In addition to the shocking Bradley Beal trade that shocked the entire league, they have also signed Drew Eubanks, Keita Bates-Diop (KBD), Chimezie Metu, Yuta Watanabe, and Eric Gordon in free agency, and reached contract extensions with Josh Okogie and Damion Lee.

After finalizing their roster for the upcoming season, the Suns have made some adjustments through signings and trades. They first sent backup point guard Cam Payne along with a second-round pick to the Spurs in exchange for a protected future second-round pick. They then acquired 23-year-old forward Bol Bol, who was recently released by the Magic, and made a trade involving draft rights with the Magic.

Bol Bol, like Eubanks, KBD, Metu, and Watanabe, is a versatile forward who can play multiple positions in the frontcourt. However, he stands out with his unique attributes. Standing at 7'2" (approximately 218 cm) with a wingspan of 7'8" (approximately 234 cm), Bol possesses a combination of size and skills that is reminiscent of this year's top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama (who is 7'4" with a wingspan of 7'10").

Bol had his best season in the league last year while playing for the Magic. In 70 games, he averaged 9.1 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks, all career highs. However, his performance fluctuated throughout the season.

In the first two and a half months of the season, Bol played 37 games, starting in 32 of them, and averaged 26.1 minutes per game. During this period, he contributed an average of 12.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, and shot 58.8% from the field. However, as injured players like Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, and Jalen Suggs returned to the Magic lineup in 2023, Bol's playing time and production decreased. In the next 33 games, he only started in one game and saw his playing time reduced by 10 minutes, resulting in averages of 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds.

One area where Bol's performance was affected by inconsistent playing time was his three-point shooting. In the first two and a half months of the season, he had a catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage of 38.1%. However, after 2023, his three-point shooting percentage dropped significantly to 8.6%. Despite this, Bol still possesses unique abilities.

His height and smooth shooting touch make him difficult to stop on cuts to the basket, as he ranks in the top 5% of the league in efficiency on cuts. Additionally, his height and wingspan give him an advantage in grabbing offensive rebounds, with Bol's putback efficiency also ranking in the top 5% of the league. Furthermore, his exceptional ball-handling skills allow him to initiate fast breaks and make decisions whether to attack the rim or take a quick pull-up jumper from beyond the three-point line.

Bol was involved in 27.6% of the Magic's offensive possessions during the transition from defense to offense, ranking 15th in the league and higher than any player on the Suns. Unlike most big men who typically serve as screeners in pick-and-roll situations, Bol's ball-handling skills allow him to be the primary ball handler in those situations. In today's positionless basketball, where big men handle the ball and forwards and guards interchange positions, it is not uncommon. Bol's usage as the ball handler in pick-and-roll situations is even higher than Nikola Jokic's, who is known for initiating Invert P&R. Bol's usage as the primary ball handler in pick-and-roll situations is at 8.6%, which is the highest among 7-footers in the league.

In summary, Bol Bol's versatile abilities in shooting, cutting, and passing make him a valuable asset for the coaching staff in terms of tactical adjustments on offense. However, his impact on the defensive end may be limited. Despite his height of over 220 cm, his thin frame hinders his effectiveness as a defender. Within a 6-foot radius of the basket, his differential percentage was only 1.1% last season. This means that when he defended opponents near the basket, their shooting percentage not only did not decrease but actually increased by 1.1%. This statistic ranked him seventh to last among all 7-footers in the league last season.
