Green Blood Ubon Tupton Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers Preseason Game Observation

Game Report: The game was mainly controlled by White on offense, with Horford and Porzingis on opposite sides. Whether it was executing pick and rolls or strong and weak side ball movement, the ball movement was much better than the previous game. Within a few minutes of the game, everyone had taken three-point shots. Horford in the corner, KP at the top of the arc, and Hauser on the fast break. Despite playing with a twin towers lineup, everyone was hitting three-point shots, creating more space than the previous game and utilizing screens more effectively. Keep reading below.

However, facing Maxey's defense, despite doing a good job with defense and positioning, he still managed to make tough shots. Combined with several low-level passing errors, the 76ers had many fast break opportunities, but it was White and Holiday's defensive efforts that stopped his speed.

However, the bench's defensive resources couldn't keep up with Maxey's speed, and poor defensive communication allowed the 76ers to find their rhythm from the outside. But on the other hand, the 76ers' defensive rotations were also poor, especially in transition defense, allowing Pritchard, Mykhailiuk, and Hauser to gain confidence with their three-point shooting. As long as the ball is rotated calmly, these bench players have the ability to disrupt the opposing team's defense from the outside. Combined with Brissett playing tough in the paint, they can compete with other teams, but it will rely heavily on their three-point shooting and defensive performance. In the middle of the second quarter, the team switched back to the starting lineup, and the pick and roll between the two guards and center was smooth. However, Tucker was very good at reading the center's movement and was able to steal the ball and draw fouls, limiting KP's shooting opportunities.

But the two guards also had a great offensive performance. White showed confidence in his three-point shooting and found his rhythm in mid-range jumpers, while Holiday used his speed to break down the defense. On the defensive end, he was precise and tallied three blocks, showcasing the level of defense from both teams. In the second half, Banton was subbed out in less than a minute, seemingly not following the coach's tactics.

With a full bench lineup, Pritchard was able to control the pace and even take on Harris on the fast break. But when teammates couldn't finish at the rim, and no one could stop Maxey, it became a struggle on both ends of the court.

For a period of time, both teams were settling for three-point shots, lacking ball movement, and preparing for the regular season. After a brief exchange of offense and defense, Hauser made some mistakes by predicting the ball, but Pritchard controlled the pace and boosted the team's confidence with his confident three-point shots. His biggest improvement was his ability to change the pace after pick and rolls. Combined with Queta reducing unnecessary passes from the previous game, as long as there's a chance for a roll in, his energy allows him to finish at the rim.

Today, the most impressive player was Svi, not just with his outside shots, but also cutting into the paint and using his explosiveness to score. Gabriel played his role as a hard worker, waiting for his chance under the rim. - - - Ubuntu ðŸ¦–
