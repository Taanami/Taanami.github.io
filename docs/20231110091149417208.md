 3 Lin Ping-yi's crucial three-pointer that led the team to top their group and advance to the top four. In the top four game, they faced their old opponent from last year's national competition, Chih Ping High School. Despite facing intense defense from Chih Ping, their energy level dropped and they were unable to defeat them, narrowly missing the chance to compete for the championship.

In the third place game, they once again faced Nan Da High School, but this time they were unable to hold on to their lead and ended up in fourth place.

Chang Sheng-hua also received the title of the national competition's blocking king! Captain Shih Hsuan-chung said, "I am very happy that we were able to win the championship in the central region this year, fulfilling last year's regrets. I am also grateful to my teammates who have been with me for the past three years. I am happy to be able to advance to the national competition with them again. I hope that our junior teammates can become more united, work harder, and take every practice and game seriously. With confidence, a team will naturally become stronger. I hope they can achieve even better results in the future." Continue reading for more on Lin Ping-yi, who had an outstanding performance this year, averaging double-digit points and being selected in the top five players. In the national group stage game against Nan Da High School, he remained quiet for three quarters before hitting the crucial three-pointer in the final moments to help the team advance to the top four with a first-place finish in their group.

Regarding the senior three lineup this year, he said, "When Little Shih (Shih Hsuan-chung) was not shooting well, I had more opportunities with the ball and was able to make the most of every possession. After advancing to the national competition, our manpower was slightly lacking, and with some players graduating and not continuing to play basketball, our energy was depleted, making the group stage games more challenging. But I am still happy that we were able to finish fourth place."

Shih Hsuan-chung, who has participated in four TGF Cups, would like to express his gratitude to the TGF staff, saying, "Thank you to all the staff for the past four years, for providing us with such a great environment to achieve our dreams. The TGF Cup gets better every year, and even has sponsorships now. I believe it will continue to grow in the future. Thank you to the hard-working TGF staff for taking care of us." Please continue reading for their future plans. Shih Hsuan-chung said that if he chooses to continue his studies, he will attend Asia University. He may also choose to serve in the military first and then plan for his future. Regardless of his decision, he will continue to move forward and find his own path. Lin Ping-yi has chosen to attend Ching Yun University of Science and Technology, and he hopes to become better and compete for the championship with his senior teammates in the future. However, the most precious thing for them on this journey is the friendship they have built over the past three years. As they graduate and go their separate ways, they will always hold onto these cherished memories in their hearts. Each of them will shine wherever they go, and they will all find their own path.
