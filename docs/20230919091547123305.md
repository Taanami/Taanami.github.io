 World Cup Notes: The Giant Warriors of Cape Verde and Puerto Ricans Not Born in Puerto Rico

Cape Verde, please continue reading* Cape Verde had a population of only 590,000 in 2023, making it the smallest country to qualify for the World Cup.

* In 2013, the United Nations representative for Cape Verde stated that the correct name should be Cabo Verde, which is the name in Portuguese. Cape Verde is an archipelago located off the coast of Senegal. Before the 15th century, it was an uninhabited island. After its discovery by Portuguese explorers in the 15th century, it became a transit point for the slave trade. After the decline of the slave trade in the 19th century, it transformed into a commercial and tourism center. Cape Verde gained independence from Portugal in 1975 and is currently one of the leading countries in Africa in terms of economy and politics.

Please continue reading* This is not the first time Cape Verde has appeared on the basketball map. In 2007, they made a remarkable performance in the FIBA Africa Championship, finishing third and earning a wild card qualification for the Beijing Olympics. Although they didn't make it to the Olympics in the end, it was the first time Cape Verde made its mark in the world of basketball. * MÃ¡rio Correia, the current president of the Cape Verde Basketball Federation, was in charge of the federation in 2007. The island only has an amateur league, and they play only seven games per year.

Please continue reading* Because they were afraid of the lack of attention for this World Cup, the president of the federation requested a journalist to accompany the team.* However, Cape Verde is not as resource-poor as it seems. According to published data, the budget for this World Cup is as high as 540,000 euros.

* The most famous basketball player from Cape Verde is Walter "Edy" Tavares, who stands at 7 feet 3 inches tall. In recent years, he has become the top center in Europe. However, he had little connection with sports in his childhood. His father, who was 6'8" tall, was a sailor. Before the age of 17, Tavares only played beach soccer. His encounter with basketball was accidental. A German coach was on vacation on the island of Mallorca in Cape Verde when he saw the towering Tavares working at his grandmother's grocery store after school. The coach thought he would be a good basketball player and asked him if he wanted to play. However, Tavares misunderstood and thought the German coach wanted him to play soccer. It was only later that he realized it was basketball. He had never played basketball before and only knew about Michael Jordan. He was recommended by the German coach to go to Gran Canaria, and within two years, he made it to the Spanish second division. At the age of 22, he secured a spot in the Spanish first division, became the shot-blocking king, and was selected in the second round of the NBA draft. After returning to Europe, he became the record holder for blocked shots in the EuroLeague.

* Initially, the most difficult thing for the German coach to let Edy Tavares play basketball was not his willingness but the fact that there was no measuring tape on the island to accurately measure his height. He didn't even know how tall he was in centimeters. * This year, the Portland Trail Blazers offered Edy Tavares a three-year, 18 million dollar contract, but he chose to stay with Real Madrid and signed an early contract extension at the end of June. It is said that the contract is worth more than 3.5 million euros, making him the second highest-paid player in Europe.

* However, there is a big gap between Edy Tavares and other Cape Verdean players. Originally, they were supposed to have naturalized players, such as 6'3" power forward Bonzie Colson, who played for the University of Notre Dame. His mother is from Cape Verde. After Tavares contacted him, Colson declined the invitation to naturalize for Jordan, which led to Jordan eventually acquiring Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. Unfortunately, neither of them could play in this tournament. * The other well-known Cape Verdean players are Betinho Gomes and Ivan Almeida. Betinho was born in Cape Verde and played for the Cape Verde U16 national team before switching to represent Portugal. He played in the Spanish first division for seven years and was the leading scorer and rebounder for Portugal in the EuroBasket qualification in 2016. He returned to represent Cape Verde in 2021 at the age of 38, saying that it was an opportunity he had been waiting for for twenty years.

* Ivan Almeida studied in the United States and played for Stonehill College in Massachusetts (which has now moved up to Division I). He has played in several European leagues, including being named MVP in Poland. * Many Cape Verdeans go to Massachusetts in the northeastern United States because it is currently the largest settlement of Cape Verdeans in the world. Out of the 100,000 Cape Verdeans in the United States, more than 70,000 are in Massachusetts, and nearly 20,000 are in New York and Rhode Island. The reason for this is that as early as the late 17th century, Cape Verdeans went to the New England region of the United States as sailors and worked as whalers. This history was also mentioned in Herman Melville's famous literary work, "Moby-Dick." The character Daggoo, a harpooner in "Moby-Dick," is based on Cape Verdeans.

Puerto Rico* Puerto Rico is a U.S. overseas territory, and all Puerto Ricans have U.S. citizenship. However, unlike Guam, Puerto Rico has its own passport and its own congress. Puerto Rico also has representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives, but they have only speaking rights. Local Puerto Ricans do not have the right to vote for the U.S. president but have the right to vote for the Puerto Rican governor. * In the past, many people had the impression that Puerto Rico was like a small U.S. team, but in reality, they are even more extreme. Former national team point guard Angel Rodriguez once said that he had to play center at around 6'2" on the street courts of Puerto Rico.

Even at the national team level, they have always lacked power forwards taller than 6'9" and centers taller than 6'10". Players taller than these measurements are usually relegated to the role of enforcers.
