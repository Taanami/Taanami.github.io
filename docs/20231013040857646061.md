 The FIBA World Cup quarter-finals came to a close yesterday with a match between Canada and Slovenia. However, the focus was not on the game, but on the issues with the referees. In the fourth quarter, both Dillon Brooks and Luka Doncic received their second technical fouls and were ejected from the game.

During the post-game press conference, Doncic expressed his frustration about being ejected, saying, "It's clear that I was disappointed. Playing for the national team means a lot to me, and when we encounter problems on the court, I sometimes can't control myself."

Regarding the fairness of the referees' calls, Doncic said, "Even my teammates told me that the referees said, 'We won't make calls for Brooks because he keeps walking towards us.' This is very unfair. I know I complain a lot, but it's still unfair. Canada was very physical, but the referees didn't make calls. That's not fair." Doncic also gave credit to Brooks for his defense, saying, "That's just the way Brooks plays. I know a lot of people don't like him, but I respect what he does on the court, and he does it well." As for the key to Canada's victory, Doncic not only praised their strong defense, but also Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's performance on offense, saying, "SGA is a tough player to guard, he's one of the best players in the world."
