# This year is the real test for the Utah Jazz's new season expectations 
 This year is the real test for the Utah Jazz's new season expectations. Despite not making the playoffs last season, and even missing out on the play-in tournament, most fans should be very pleased with the team's performance considering our initial expectations. Executive Danny Ainge let go of the obsession with the playoffs before the trade deadline, trading some veteran players for future assets, which is the operational model that fans hoped for after Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert left.

Big man Walker Kessler has the opportunity to take his game to the next level after an impressive rookie season, where he had a shooting percentage of 72% and blocked 173 shots, ranking fourth in the league.

Furthermore, Lauri Markkanen, who was selected for the All-Star team and won the NBA Most Improved Player award, will also be returning. He had a career year last season, averaging 25.6 points and 8.6 rebounds per game with a near 50% shooting percentage. In addition, the trade for 25-year-old John Collins represents a low-risk, high-reward investment that adds more depth to the Jazz's core lineup. 

Early last season was a pleasant surprise, as most people did not anticipate Markkanen's significant improvement. Without Mitchell, it was expected that the team would lack a scoring leader and the ability to go toe-to-toe with opponents in crucial moments. Surprisingly, Markkanen not only excelled in three-point shooting (39.1%), but also showed good ball handling skills, forcing defenders to limit his driving routes and counterattacks.

As for other players, veteran Jordan Clarkson has started to develop his own organizational skills, and Talen Horton-Tucker occasionally has scoring outbursts. This team seems to have a certain level of competitiveness in the future.

However, the biggest concern is whether the Jazz can compete for a playoff spot in the highly competitive Western Conference. Despite their defensive potential and Kessler getting more playing time in his second season, it's hard to imagine the team having an above-average record. Last season, they ranked eighth in defense in the league, allowing opponents to score 116 points per 100 possessions and ranking last in points allowed in the paint and points off turnovers.

With center Kelly Olynyk potentially seeing reduced playing time to make room for Kessler, and Collins possibly entering the starting lineup, the Jazz may be slightly lacking in frontcourt playmaking.

Last season, the combination of Markkanen, Collins, and Kessler averaged only four assists per game. However, Collins' addition is still hard to oppose, even with his large contract amount. The Jazz acquired him affordably during a low point, and last season his three-point shooting percentage was the worst of his career at 29.2%. However, it's undeniable that Collins had finger health issues. If the finger problems decrease, there is reason to believe that Collins' three-point shooting can approach his career average of 35% or even better, providing considerable value to the Jazz's contract.

Regardless, the rebuilding Jazz team should still be intriguing. They may not have another unexpectedly great season, but with the strong performances of their core players from last season, they are sure to have exciting games.
