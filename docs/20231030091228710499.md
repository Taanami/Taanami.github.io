 Recently, a fan posted a story on Instagram, tagging Damian Lillard and stating that he is the "future legend" of the Miami Heat. Lillard then reposted the story, but later deleted it. According to previous reports, Lillard is only planning to report to training camp with the Portland Trail Blazers or his potential new team. Whether he will join another team before the start of the season will greatly affect the overall balance of power in the NBA.
