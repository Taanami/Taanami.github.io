  The Dangerous Factors of Lithuanian Basketball, the Dark Horse from Eastern Europe in the 2023 World Cup

Lithuania is undoubtedly one of the dark horses in this year's World Cup. Ranked 15th by FIBA a few months ago, they managed to pull down several strong teams and even defeated the USA.

Even within their own country, nobody expected them to perform as well as they have this year.

Now, let's get to know Lithuania, the Eastern European team that has impressed in this year's World Cup.

Continue reading "Who's Next?" This was the reaction of Lithuania's top player Jonas Valanciunas on the BasketNews Instagram account, weeks before the training camp started, after former assistant coach Kestutis Kemzura resigned. Valanciunas has not missed any major FIBA tournament in the past 16 years. So when another teammate chose not to attend the national team training camp, he expressed his frustration. Lithuania could have assembled a team with all the top players, but players like Domantas Sabonis, Marius Grigonis, Rokas Giedraitis, Edgaras Ulanovas, Arnas Butkevicius, Lukas Lekavicius, and Arturas Gudaitis refused to represent Lithuania in the World Cup for various reasons.

However, the remaining players have become a perfect example that star players do not always guarantee the best results, and vice versa.

Continue reading Although it was disappointing that Sabonis, a top Lithuanian basketball star, chose not to participate in the World Cup, it somewhat relieved head coach Kazys Maksvytis. He no longer has to worry about how to make Valanciunas and Sabonis work well together on the court, as previous coaches have struggled to successfully pair these two NBA players, as proven in previous international competitions.

Valanciunas became the team's main low-post threat, guaranteeing scoring in the paint. His performance in the World Cup met expectations, averaging 14.5 points (with an impressive 69.2% field goal percentage), 11 rebounds, and 1.5 assists, showcasing excellent efficiency. He also made it to the All-Tournament Second Team.

Continue reading Before the World Cup, 22-year-old Jokubaitis did not fully live up to the expectations and potential he had been recognized for in the past few years.

He faced difficulties in the first game against Egypt, scoring only 2 points with a 0-for-6 shooting and committing three turnovers. However, he quickly bounced back like an experienced star. In the following three games against Mexico, Montenegro, and Greece, Jokubaitis averaged 17.7 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 6.3 assists, with an impressive scoring efficiency of 23.3.

Moreover, his three-point shooting was outstanding, making 7 of 8 attempts. Despite being only 22 years old and one of the youngest starting point guards in the tournament, his teammates appreciate his ability to control the game and guide the offense.

"When I look back at my own performance and decisions at his age, I can only give him great praise because he can effectively deal with the high-level challenges he faces. He is well aware that if he performs poorly, we may face a difficult game. He struggled in his debut, just like last year. But he quickly learned from his mistakes and made progress." said Mindaugas Kuzminskas.

With Marius Grigonis withdrawing, Ignas Brazdeikis becomes the only true scoring threat who can solve problems in crucial moments, especially when Lithuania needs a last-minute one-on-one solution. Teammates have noticed that Brazdeikis is less inclined to force his way to the basket and instead reads the situation well and is willing to share the ball, unlike last year.

Brazdeikis currently averages 11.5 points per game, with a two-point field goal percentage of 54.5% and an impressive three-point field goal percentage of 70%. He also contributes with 4.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game.

His turnovers have decreased from 2.2 in the previous EuroBasket to 1.0 in the World Cup, and his shooting percentage has increased by a surprising 20.7%.

The other players around this core team have showcased their professional specialties, whether as defensive aces or versatile veterans, always prioritizing team success over personal ambitions.

For example, former New York Knicks player Mindaugas Kuzminskas hardly made it into the rotation in the 2019 World Cup and 2021 Olympic qualifiers. However, under the guidance of Kazys Maksvytis, he successfully regained his confidence and returned to his normal performance. As a 33-year-old veteran, Kuzminskas has performed exceptionally well in the World Cup, averaging 10.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 2.5 assists per game, with an impressive two-point field goal percentage of 75% and a three-point field goal percentage of 46.2%. He is also capable of making crucial shots in key moments of the game.
