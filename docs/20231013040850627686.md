After leading the Kaohsiung 17 Live Iron and Steel team to a "Lin Crazy" craze in the PLG last season, Jeremy Lin officially switched to the New Taipei Kings team and will become a member of the King's defense in the new season. When asked about his decision to leave the Iron and Steel team and join the Kings, he revealed that he received congratulatory messages from several former teammates, but he also emphasized that he is not looking forward to facing his former teammates on the court.

After officially joining the Kings last Thursday, Jeremy Lin held a press conference and practiced at the New Taipei Sports Center today. Regarding his decision to join the Kings as a free agent, he said, "Four or five teammates from the Iron and Steel team sent me messages saying they are happy for me and looking forward to playing against me. The experience with the Iron and Steel team last year will always be remembered, but playing against them is not that much fun for me, so I am not really looking forward to it." After joining the Iron and Steel team last year, Jeremy Lin took on the role of spiritual leader and led the team to a strong finish in the second half of the season. He emphasized that he will bring the same leadership qualities to the Kings. "I believe it's important to unite the team. My playing style and role will be different on different teams, but the most important thing is how to bring the team together. That is the first goal for me as a guard." When talking about his new teammates, Jeremy Lin is excited, including foreign players Manny, Mullen, and others who he is looking forward to working with. He also specifically mentioned Kings guard Li Kaiyan, "I think Kaiyan has not reached his full potential yet. His abilities are much better than what he has shown." The Kings will play against the Dreamers and Iron and Steel teams in the PLG preseason on October 7-9. Whether Jeremy Lin will make his debut after joining the team is still uncertain. He emphasized that he will follow the coach's arrangements. "I'm not sure if I will play in the preseason, it depends on the coach. I just joined the team, so I can't guarantee that I won't play or how much I will play." Jeremy Lin practices in the Kings' practice jersey. Photo/Basketball Notes
