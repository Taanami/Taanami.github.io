  Tyrese Haliburton's New Challenge in the 2023 World Cup

Four years ago, the US team finished in their worst-ever seventh place in the World Cup, so there was a lot of attention on the team from the announcement of the roster to their matches against other teams. Looking at the roster, Jalen Brunson and Brandon Ingram represented the middle generation, while young stars like Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton joined them. On the defensive end, they had the newly crowned best defensive player Jaren Jackson Jr. and Walker Kessler guarding the paint. Although they didn't have superstars, I was optimistic about their chances of winning the gold medal.

Continuing to read on, despite dominating their opponents in the group stage, the US team still faced their biggest problem on the international stage - spacing.

The biggest difference between FIBA and NBA rules is the allowance of a 3-second violation in the paint, which means that creating space on the FIBA court can be more congested. Observing this US team, two major issues can be identified - the quality of screening by big men and the lack of efficiency in perimeter shooting and receiving. This led to the offense relying heavily on isolation plays. However, apart from Anthony Edwards, the efficiency of isolation plays was not high. Especially for Brunson, who is known for his efficient offense in the NBA, his height became a disadvantage in the narrow FIBA space. The limited space resulted in more double teams, which compressed his preferred vertical shooting space. As a result, the team's most organized point guard in the starting lineup was contained, leading to an overreliance on transition offense as the most effective scoring method.

However, when the starting lineup was replaced with substitutes like Tyrese Haliburton and Austin Reaves, some relief was found. Haliburton, as a pass-first point guard, often adjusted his own attacking mode to cooperate with his teammates.

From learning how to switch between on-ball and off-ball movements with De'Aaron Fox when he first entered the league, to playing with the Toronto Raptors alongside players like Bennedict Mathurin and Myles Turner, Haliburton understood the art of resetting himself. In this US team, his combination with Reaves and Paolo Banchero brought a different style, whether it was lurking on the perimeter and shooting cold arrows or cutting and distributing the ball after receiving it. They even broke through deadlock situations and scored individually. With Haliburton's help, this substitute combination helped the US team come back from behind in many games. Continuing to read on, let's look at the outlook for the next season.

What excites the fans of the Sacramento Kings is that despite being a supporting role alongside other stars, Haliburton, who often positions himself as a shooter, quietly adds to his outside shooting arsenal. Moreover, when faced with a stalemate, he is willing to take the ball and attack the basket, whether it's through drives, mid-range jumpers, or hostage dribbles that are essential for top guards. All of these were seen in this tournament, and his improved dribbling allows him to have more means to organize the team's offense when faced with a deadlock, instead of relying solely on one-step three-point jumpers like last season, trying to break the opponent's defense.

Improved ball-handling means increased offensive threat, combined with his elite spatial awareness and court understanding, making him more threatening on the offensive end in the upcoming season.

On the defensive end, Haliburton's progress is also evident. In addition to his already excellent steal instincts, he has improved his footwork in one-on-one defense and timing and positioning when navigating screens. Although his slim physique makes it challenging for him to switch on defense, he can still apply pressure to guards with his long arms. He can also use his footwork to navigate around screens and disrupt the opponent's passing lanes, causing them more significant problems. Continuing to read on, even though he didn't help the US team win a medal, it is still a bit unfortunate. However, Haliburton's performance in the World Cup showed us that his impact goes beyond statistics (averaging 8.6 points, 3 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game). His attention to detail in running off the ball and his synergy with teammates demonstrate that this young point guard, who was selected as an All-Star for the first time last year, is still evolving. Last season, he achieved an average of 20 points and 10 assists per game, and we look forward to seeing him become a more well-rounded facilitator in the upcoming season, leading the Sacramento Kings to greater heights.
