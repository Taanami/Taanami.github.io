  The Educational Significance of the 2023 Jones Cup is Greater than Basketball: Russell Turner's Coaching Philosophy

"This is not my first time here," said Russell Turner slowly. After a three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Jones Cup is back this year, inviting the University of California Irvine (UCI) to represent the United States. Turner, who has been in charge of UCI since 2010, is once again setting foot on the island. The last time he came "here," referring to 27 years ago in 1996, the Jones Cup also had a US team, with ACC stars from the NCAA participating. At that time, Turner was an assistant coach at Wake Forest University and accompanied the US team to Taiwan. Please continue reading.

Having participated in the Jones Cup before, Turner has a deep understanding of the competition and schedule. Although it may not be a tournament with official rankings or scores, having teams from various Asian countries participating is still a special and meaningful challenge for NCAA teams. "Playing 8 games in 9 days, just like 11 games in 12 days back then, is a very intense schedule that puts us to the test. In mid-August, many universities in the US have already started their new semester, but UCI is still on vacation due to scheduling arrangements. Therefore, it is a perfect opportunity for us to train before the new semester begins." About two months before the start of the Jones Cup, UCI announced on its official website that its basketball team would participate. According to NCAA regulations, each university is allowed to have an international program once every four years, and UCI chose the Jones Cup for their journey this time.

"A lot of people in the US only watch American basketball," Turner said. "The US is undoubtedly the best country in basketball, but basketball is not limited to just one style. Different countries, talents, and strategies in basketball require NCAA players to learn in order to understand the various ways the game operates."

Although UCI started the Jones Cup with three consecutive victories, scoring over 100 points and winning by a margin of more than 60 points each time, Turner believes that this does not mean they are a superpower far superior to other teams, or that the Jones Cup lacks challenges for UCI. "Many of our players are seeing how Asian teams play for the first time. In reality, teams like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates improved as the tournament went on. The result of losing to us on the first day may not truly reflect their strength. We just had enough depth in our roster this time to change strategies based on the on-court situation. We performed well in the Jones Cup, even better than I expected, and that's why we won."

UCI brought 17 players to the Jones Cup this time. Turner mentioned that they usually maintain a roster of 16 players for the university team. Bringing an extra player this time was due to the need for depth in the lineup for intensive back-to-back games and the requirement to adjust tactics against different countries. Among the six players over 205 cm, four of them are over 210 cm, which is taller than Turner's usual lineup plan of having at least two players on the court to maintain a "twin towers" formation. However, in games against the Chinese Taipei Blue and White teams, Turner changed to a lineup with one big and four small players when he believed that spacing and defensive coverage were more important. "My forwards also performed well and lived up to my expectations of changing the lineup. That's where we excelled."

Over twenty years ago, Turner was an assistant coach at Wake Forest University. He then moved to Stanford from 2000 to 2004 and joined the NBA's Golden State Warriors as an assistant coach in 2004. In 2010, he left the NBA to become the head coach at UCI. While being a head coach carries more prestige than an assistant coach, Turner believes that the educational significance that college basketball brings is more important than professional basketball. "Compared to professional basketball, college coaches can have a greater impact on players. College players may not be mature, but college coaches don't necessarily have to immediately help players secure better contracts. Instead, they can help them grow from boys to better men through their presence on the court. Of course, I still need to help the team win in college. But if I can help players become better individuals and bring more positive influences to themselves and their environment, that would be an achievement as a college coach," said Turner.

In Turner's philosophy, winning is certainly important in basketball. Whether it's his original "twin towers" formation or the tallest starting lineup in NCAA history, which stood at 7 feet 6 inches and 6 feet 8 inches in a game in 2015, Turner wants to convey to his players that there is more to basketball than just winning. "When I first came to UCI, none of the players were taller than me (6 feet 7 inches). We played fast, like Asian teams. Now, I usually use two big players, and we can still win. What I want to say is that basketball is always related to physique and skills. Having a better physique and better skills can give you an advantage. However, the most beautiful thing on the basketball court is that you always have different ways to improve. As long as you focus on your own path to success, you can make great things happen."
