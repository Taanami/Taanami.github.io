 NBA needs to strengthen shooting abilities, and the Mavericks, 76ers, and Bucks have shown interest in Buddy Hield. According to reporter Shams Charania, there have been rumors about a trade involving Buddy Hield from the Sacramento Kings. The reason behind this is the disagreement over contract extension terms. Today, it was reported that the Mavericks, 76ers, and Bucks have shown interest in acquiring a shooting guard.

According to Shams, Dallas Mavericks, Philadelphia 76ers, and Milwaukee Bucks all have a certain need for a shooter. Over the past few months, they have expressed their interest in Buddy Hield. However, this trade has not happened yet.

Shams also mentioned that the trade involving Hield will not happen before the start of the season. It is possible that there will be some developments after the season starts. Hield is widely recognized as one of the top shooters in the league. Over the past five years, he has made more three-pointers than Stephen Curry and Damian Lillard. Furthermore, there is a statistic that shows Hield has missed fewer games (6 times) in his seven seasons in the NBA compared to the number of seasons he has played, indicating his exceptional level of health.
