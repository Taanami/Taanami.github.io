 Brazil's Raul Neto will be absent for the remaining World Cup matches due to a ruptured patellar tendon.

In yesterday's game between Brazil and Iran at the World Cup, former NBA player Raul Neto suffered a serious injury while driving to the basket on a fast break. He was forced to leave the game and undergo an examination, which revealed a ruptured patellar tendon. As a result, he will be unable to participate in the remaining World Cup schedule. The injury occurred in the third quarter, just two minutes into the game. Brazil was already leading by a wide margin at halftime. Neto was the player to finish the fast break, but it seems that he may have been injured before attempting to jump, as he fell to the ground in pain. The diagnosis of a ruptured patellar tendon is a very serious injury, as seen with NBA player Jeremy Lin, who suffered the same injury while playing for the Brooklyn Nets. After recovering, Lin's performance gradually declined, and he eventually faded out of the league. Neto's injury not only affects Brazil's performance in this tournament, but also has implications for his new team in Turkey. He will definitely be unable to play next year. We wish Neto a speedy recovery.

With Neto out, the ball-handling duties in the backcourt for Brazil will now fall to 40-year-old Marcelo Huertas, who had a solid performance today with 10 points and 6 assists. Further reading: Pre-match analysis of Group G at the 2023 Basketball World Cup: Spain, Brazil, Iran, Ivory Coast.
