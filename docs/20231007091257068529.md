 NBA player Kai Jones caused quite a stir after his recent IG live stream. Jones, known for his extravagant green hairstyle, recorded himself incoherently speaking to the camera, which raised concerns among fans about potential substance abuse. Some fans believed that Jones' state of confusion during the live stream could lead to trouble, similar to what happened with Ja Morant. However, Jones confidently stated, "If I get a call (to be traded), I'll just say goodbye, but I don't think that will happen." Many fans are urging the league to drug test him tomorrow. If Jones is using marijuana, he may not face any trouble as the NBA has excluded it from its list of banned substances. However, if he is found to be abusing drugs, he may face suspension or fines. Kai Jones possesses incredible explosiveness. (Photo by Reuters)
