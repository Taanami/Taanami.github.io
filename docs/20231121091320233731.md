# In today's Bulls vs 
 In today's Bulls vs. Thunder game, last year's second overall pick, Chet Holmgren, made his NBA regular season debut. However, in the second quarter of the game, Andre Drummond stole the ball from Holmgren and made a fast break, causing the whole arena to cheer as he faked out Holmgren and made a layup. The Bulls and Thunder game is still ongoing, and Holmgren has played 17 minutes, scoring 7 points, 3 rebounds, and 2 assists.
