When asked about his situation on the 76ers, Harden said, "The 76ers changed my team status. They know I can do more, they know I can give more. But if you let me tell the truth, I feel like I'm being tied up... I've never had the opportunity to be a free scorer and organizer." "I think about the game, I am the creator on the court. I need someone to trust me, believe in me, understand that I am not a system player, but I have my own system." When asked by the reporter if he wants to prove something, Harden said, "I want to prove everything.

I can team up with anyone and compete for the championship. I think for personal statistics, we are all on the same team, all those things are in the past, and now we only have one goal."

When asked why he specifically mentioned wanting to come to the Clippers, Harden said, "It's a good fit, a good opportunity, and like I said... going home."

Harden also said, "Russell Westbrook is definitely one of the reasons I came to the Clippers.

I think Westbrook also wants to prove something."
