# Sharp weapons cut through iron like mud 
 Sharp weapons cut through iron like mud. The wind is sharp, and little Iron intends to be like it. I hope to have more discussions and share various opinions on watching games. After the press conference, the 2023 Cross-League Invitational Tournament will once again take place, this time even bigger than last year. Even the three-time champion of the University Basketball Association, National Chengchi University, will step onto the battlefield and test if the "Universe NCCU" can challenge higher levels, which will undoubtedly become a major topic of the Cross-League Invitational Tournament. As the younger brother, NCCU has no burden. No one will blame them for losing to professional teams, but if they win, the big brother may not be able to save face. The tournament rules state that foreign players cannot be used, but foreign students can be registered, and foreign students are NCCU's basic equipment. The main player, who is known as the "strongest foreign student," can participate, which is advantageous for NCCU. However, NCCU challenging higher levels may not be the biggest topic of this tournament. If we consider Taiwan Beer Leopards and SBL Taiwan Beer as a joint team, the T1 League newcomer, Taipei Fubon Braves, can be said to be the purest representative of the T1 League participating team. In the last Cross-League Invitational Tournament, the T1 League outperformed P. LEAGUE+ and SBL, and the championship game was a T1 League showdown between New Taipei Fubon Braves and Taiwan Beer Bears. However, before the Braves took the court, the Taipei Fubon Braves became the biggest topic, but not because of any positive news about the team. Please continue reading. On the participation list, Taipei Fubon Braves wrote "Lin Ping-Cheng" in black and white, as previously claimed. Lin Ping-Cheng will indeed represent the Braves in the Cross-League Invitational Tournament. Of course, this time, the tournament does not have Hsinchu Formosa Taishin Dreamers who participated last time, which somewhat reduces the storm. However, Lin Ping-Cheng, Formosa Taishin Dreamers, and the Braves are destined to be the focus of Taiwanese basketball this offseason. And just today, the Braves held a press conference to announce the team lineup, cheerleaders, mascot, and two foreign players, as well as the foreign head coach Brian Adams. However, whether it is the news on social media about the press conference or the comments on the live stream of the press conference, they are filled with criticism and mockery, making it clear that the Braves did not step onto the stage of the Taiwanese professional basketball league in a celebratory atmosphere. The never-ending storm of the "Braves," please continue reading. The Taipei Fubon Braves and Lin Ping-Cheng held a press conference on Monday (September 11) to publicly announce the team's lineup, cheerleaders, mascot, and two foreign players, as well as their recent developments and decision-making processes. However, the biggest problem is that at the end of the "press conference," the host on-site said that Lin Ping-Cheng and the appointed lawyer "will not be interviewed" and only allowed reporters to "chat with team leader Shang Jui-Chiang" if they had any questions. However, throughout the press conference, apart from emphasizing the opposition between Taipei Fubon and Formosa Dreamers, Shang Jui-Chiang only revealed some statements like "the price of the Braves may not be higher than that of the Dreamers, but it provides Lin Ping-Cheng with more security overseas." In terms of a press conference, this is undoubtedly a very bad way to handle it. From an obvious perspective, this is an event where one person signs contracts with two teams. Of course, the contract of one party (Dreamers) is now questioned and may be invalid. But the key point lies in the person who signed with both parties. Unless he is sure that his proactive statement is flawless and leaves no doubt for all parties, the reporters will naturally want to ask this person questions. And of course, Taipei Fubon may be worried that Lin Ping-Cheng, as a player, may have doubts about his ability to express himself. However, this is the job of the appointed lawyer. Since Lin Ping-Cheng was able to be represented by an appointed lawyer in the previous coordination meeting, it is the basic obligation for both Lin Ping-Cheng and the appointed lawyer to be interviewed at the press conference they both attended today. However, in the end, Lin Ping-Cheng inexplicably said, "I will take responsibility for what I should." The appointed lawyer only mentioned the "right to bring legal action," which has become a basic joke on the internet. Then, the two refused to be interviewed and only left team leader Shang Jui-Chiang. From the content of his "chat" with the media, it is obvious that Coach Shang cannot clarify any doubts about Lin Ping-Cheng. In other words, although there have been many details revealed from the outbreak of the event until now, such as the time Formosa Dreamers contacted Lin Ping-Cheng, the content of the contract, and the contract period, none of them are perfect and can be attacked. But after this "press conference" ended on Monday, the negative opinions towards Taipei Fubon increased even more. This negative evaluation even extended to the social media platform. Taipei Fubon Braves' Instagram account went live after the press conference, and Lin Ping-Cheng, who was once indifferent to joining the Dreamers, actively commented on many posts by the Braves. Especially when the Braves introduced their players in subsequent posts, Lin Ping-Cheng almost always left comments very early, expressing his recognition as a team member and goodwill towards his teammates. However, due to recent inappropriate public appearances or statements, the Braves' Instagram account became like a "burning" platform. Not only did Lin Ping-Cheng's comments receive numerous critical replies, but even when Lin Ping-Cheng stopped commenting, mocking comments from netizens continued to flood the Braves' Instagram account.
