  Lakers Game Report: Young Magic teaches Lakers a lesson

Today the Lakers faced the Magic on the road, just five days after their last meeting where the Lakers narrowly defeated the Magic by 3 points. However, the score difference between the two teams was quite significant in today's game. Despite being plagued with injuries, the Purple and Gold continued to use an eight-man rotation, but this strategy that helped them defeat the Clippers last game did not bring them victory today. With significant flaws in both offense and defense, the Lakers ultimately lost 101-120 to the Magic, dropping their record back to 50% (3 wins, 3 losses).

Please continue reading about Anthony Davis' impressive stats behind the scenes. Davis scored 28 points, grabbed 13 rebounds, and had 7 blocks, all while being limited by foul trouble and only playing 32 minutes. One of the reasons for Davis' limited playing time was because he had already committed 3 fouls before the end of the first half. It must be said that without Davis, the Lakers' defense would have been even more lacking. The team's lack of defensive effort was a key factor in their defeat. Although the Lakers had 6 steals and 10 blocks compared to the Magic's 6 steals and 10 blocks, the Lakers' defense still had many issues, especially in the first half where they allowed the Magic to score 67 points (39 of which were in the first quarter). It's worth noting that before this game, the Magic were only averaging 107.6 points per game, ranking 23rd in the league.

The Lakers had many turnovers in the first half, giving the Magic opportunities for fast breaks. However, their transition defense was not ideal, especially when they had their "twin towers" on the court. In the middle of the first quarter, Davis found his rhythm and scored three consecutive baskets. The Magic quickly responded by sending a double team when Davis had the ball in the low post, causing him to turn the ball over. Additionally, the Magic's young guards, such as Anthony Black and Jalen Suggs, were very aggressive on defense and played a crucial role in initiating early offense and finding open teammates on the perimeter to punish the Lakers' passive defensive rotations.

Despite the Lakers' decent defense and shot-blocking, they were unable to secure many rebounds, especially on the offensive end. With key players such as Rui Hachimura, Taurean Prince, Jarred Vanderbilt, and Gabe Vincent out due to injuries, the Lakers' defense was put to the test. In this game, they were unable to communicate well on defense like they did in their last game, and they were unable to fully utilize their twin towers. Instead, they gave the Magic many scoring opportunities in the mid-range and inside the paint. D'Angelo Russell, who started in place of the injured players, lacked focus on defense, and Cam Reddish was unable to contain the more physical Paolo Banchero. The projected 2022 number 1 draft pick had an all-around game, scoring 25 points, grabbing 7 rebounds, and dishing out 10 assists with a 60% shooting percentage and 50% from the three-point line. This was a stark contrast from his previous 4 games where he only averaged 12.5 points and shot less than 40%.

In the first half, the Magic incorporated many off-ball screens and backdoor cuts, causing problems for the Lakers, especially in the first three quarters. They often used pick-and-rolls to pull Davis out of the paint, taking away the Lakers' biggest defensive advantage and allowing Banchero, Franz Wagner, and others to easily attack the basket. Without their starting center, Wendell Carter Jr., the Magic started 6'11" Goga Bitadze, who was not able to effectively limit Davis' scoring, but he and Moritz Wagner took turns protecting the paint and helped the Magic outrebound the Lakers.

One of the reasons the Lakers were trailing in the first half was their lack of second-chance points and offensive rebounds. In the first two quarters, the Lakers only grabbed 1 offensive rebound compared to the Magic's 11. This also helped the Magic score 26 points off of second chances. The Lakers' slow start and poor offensive efficiency were on full display, and when they tried to make a comeback in the fourth quarter, it was too late. LeBron James was still the Lakers' main offensive threat, scoring 24 points, grabbing 9 rebounds, and dishing out 5 assists. He became more aggressive in the second half and drove to the basket more often, but it was too little too late.

In the crucial moments of the game, the Lakers' outside shooting was not reliable, especially DLo, who played the second-most minutes on the team and only made 1 out of 10 three-point attempts. His consecutive missed threes in the fourth quarter also killed the Lakers' momentum, and his poor defense did not help the team either. In the absence of Prince and Vanderbilt, the only remaining small forward was Reddish, who had a very off night. He only needed to focus on defense and provide some outside shooting, but he was unable to do either effectively.

In summary, the lack of depth cannot be used as an excuse for the Lakers' loss. Facing a younger and more aggressive Magic team, the Lakers' attitude from the beginning was not what a championship team should have. Their rebounding, outside shooting, and team defense were all problematic, despite having a talented roster on paper.
