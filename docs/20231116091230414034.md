 In the fourth quarter, the Denver Nuggets took a significant lead and their fans could be heard shouting "Who's your daddy?" throughout the arena. The Nuggets faced off against their Western Conference rivals, the Los Angeles Lakers, in their season opener and ultimately defeated them 119-107. This phrase originated during last year's championship parade when the host invited head coach Michael Malone to the stage and referred to the Nuggets as the Lakers' "daddy".
