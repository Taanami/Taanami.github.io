# The video of NBA Denver Nuggets player Michael Porter Jr 
 The video of NBA Denver Nuggets player Michael Porter Jr. throwing the first pitch for the Chinatrust Brothers has gained attention recently. During his visit to Taiwan in early September, Porter Jr. was invited to throw the first pitch for the Brothers and the Nuggets' broadcast unit captured this moment during their media day. His teammates also shared their thoughts on his pitch. Many of them pointed out that Porter Jr. seemed to have trouble adjusting to the mound, and his form resembled a basketball shot rather than a pitch. DeAndre Jordan and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope even imitated his pitch, causing Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray to burst into laughter. In the video, Porter Jr. also explained that he usually has a great pitch during bullpen practice, but the height of the mound was unfamiliar to him, causing him to throw the ball straight down into the grass.
