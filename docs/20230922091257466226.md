 Aggressive Leadership Style of Dennis Schroder and Germany's Unfinished Mission

The preparations for the previous EuroBasket tournament evidently had an impact on the present. Maxi Kleber, wanting to fully prepare for the NBA season, refused to represent the national team, which led Dennis Schroder to publicly criticize him.

A year later, despite Kleber expressing his desire to participate, the comments made by the "leader" of the German national team still hurt him, making him feel unwelcome and reluctant to express his stance to the national team's head coach, Gordon Herbert.

Continue reading for FIBA World Cup - Germany: Past Results and Best Performances of the National Team. Germany has participated in the World Cup a total of seven times, but they have only advanced to the semifinals twice, with their best result being a bronze medal in 2002.

In that tournament, Dirk Nowitzki had an outstanding performance (24 points, 11 rebounds), but Germany was still defeated by Argentina in the semifinals.

In the battle for third place, Nowitzki once again delivered an excellent performance with 29 points, leading Germany to victory over New Zealand.

Four years ago, Germany ambitiously participated in the FIBA World Cup but suffered a setback as they were eliminated in the first round by the Dominican Republic. Read on for their path to qualification.

Germany unsurprisingly qualified for the FIBA World Cup this year. They only lost one game in the first stage (5 wins, 1 loss), which was against Estonia in the first round.

In the second part of the qualification phase, they continued their dominance and finished with a total score of 10-2, securing the top spot. Key players, please continue reading.

Perhaps it sounds a bit critical, but the current team's supposed leader seems to fall short of the title due to his own actions. After all, becoming a leader requires recognition from others, not just one's own opinion. However, Dennis Schroder is undoubtedly the most important player. Without his outstanding performance in the previous World Cup, Germany would not have won the bronze medal.

Perhaps on the court, it has never been an issue. But when an important player in the lineup decides not to help the national team due to the "leader's" public statements, it becomes a significant problem. Photo source: Getty Images. Nevertheless, with Schroder here and Kleber absent, this is the ideal moment to end this story.

Last season, Schroder played in 66 NBA games for the Los Angeles Lakers, averaging 12.6 points and 4.5 assists per game. In addition, the Wagner brothers have proven themselves to be reliable. Last year, Schroder and Franz Wagner were bronze medalists in the EuroCup.

Although Moritz Wagner was unable to compete due to injury, he had an excellent performance at the Olympics two years ago.

Johannes Thiemann and Johannes Voigtmann, as two experienced European league players, should not be overlooked, and Isaac Bonga can defend all positions from point guard to center. The three of them can also threaten opponents from the perimeter. Adding Daniel Theis' size and abilities in the paint makes it difficult for opponents to gain an advantage against Germany. Maodo Lo in the backcourt will be the backup plan when Schroder is off the court, as he has proven multiple times through his scoring ability.

However, the most anticipated C&S player is Andreas Obst. Despite missing most of last season due to injury, Obst is now healthy and ready to provide his strongest weapon to the national team, which is three-point shooting.

In this regard, he is undoubtedly one of the most outstanding players in European leagues. Head coach Gordon Herbert. Germany's head coach is Canadian-born Gordon Herbert. In his illustrious coaching career, he has led multiple professional teams and even had three stints coaching in Frankfurt. He led them to win the German League championship in 2004 and received the Coach of the Year award representing the same team in 2016.

Furthermore, Frankfurt also lifted the FIBA Europe Cup trophy that season. He has also worked with the Canadian coaching staff and served as an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors, as well as the coach for the Georgian national men's basketball team.

He took on the role of head coach for the German national team in 2021. In their first significant competition, he led "Die Mannschaft" to win a medal at the EuroBasket for the first time in 17 years.

Currently, they have remained unbeaten in the preliminary round and have a high chance of winning the gold medal. We will soon find out if this team can achieve another great result in the World Cup.
