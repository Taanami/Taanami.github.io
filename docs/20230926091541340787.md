 Changes in the Los Angeles Lakers' reinforcement policy for upgrading their team strength this summer

The Los Angeles Lakers recently reached an agreement with free agent Christian Wood, finalizing their offseason moves about a month before training camp begins.

After completing the signing, Wood expressed his excitement on Twitter, stating, "It's a dream come true to play for the Lakers."

In fact, his dream might also coincide with the liberation of another important player in Los Angeles: Anthony Davis. According to sources, Davis has expressed the need for more support at the center position, allowing him to avoid shouldering the role of a center in regular season games.

Davis' request is reasonable. Advanced statistics show that last season, AD played as a center for a staggering 99% of the time. His resurgence last season earned him a three-year, $186 million contract extension.

Lakers' Vice President of Basketball Operations, Rob Pelinka, undoubtedly heard Davis' plea and immediately acquired Wood for the team. In addition, they also brought in 7-foot backup center Jaxson Hayes.

27-year-old Wood is the seventh new face to join the Lakers after last season.

Although the Lakers made it to the Western Conference Finals last season, their surprising journey ended with the Denver Nuggets.

Despite losing some key players, including Dennis Schroder, who was the Most Valuable Player of the World Cup, Lonnie Walker IV, who had notable performances in the playoffs, versatile Troy Brown Jr., and reliable big man Wenyen Gabriel, the Lakers' strength seems to have increased rather than decreased with their core players remaining.

Managing the team this summer was quite challenging for Pelinka and the Lakers, as they only had a $4.5 million biannual exception, a $12.4 million mid-level exception, and some veteran minimum contracts to offer.

The highlight of the Lakers' offseason was signing Wood, showcasing a different approach compared to the past few years. They didn't repeat the complete overhaul of the roster like the 2020-21 season or focus solely on the fame and achievements of young players for the 2021-22 season. Instead, they emphasized team fit, athleticism, and didn't insist on assembling a "Big Three" lineup like last season.

Considering the team's style, the Lakers signed new members who should be able to integrate into Darvin Ham's defensive mentality. These players include Gabe Vincent from the Miami Heat and Taurean Prince, who joined from the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Lakers took a gamble on some promising young players this year, including Wood, Hayes, and Cam Reddish. They also addressed their shooting deficiencies from last season by acquiring accurate shooters such as Vincent, who had a 43% three-point shooting percentage in the playoffs, and Prince, who maintained a high level of 38.1% shooting from beyond the arc. Rookie D'Moi Hodge also had a 40% three-point shooting percentage during his college career at the University of Missouri.

Additionally, the Lakers signed contracts with two rookies, Jalen Hood-Schifino and Maxwell Lewis. However, these signings were overshadowed by other moves. Ultimately, the Lakers sealed a two-year, $5.7 million contract with Wood, with a player option for the second year. Nevertheless, retaining their core players was more important than any other acquisitions. In order to keep their legendary Hall of Famers in Los Angeles, the Lakers re-signed their trio of young players: Austin Reaves (4 years, $56 million), D'Angelo Russell (2 years, $37 million), and Rui Hachimura (3 years, $51 million). These three players played a crucial role in the Lakers' late-season surge last year, contributing to an 18-6 record, including the playoffs and the first two rounds. Along with LeBron James entering his 21st year, the Lakers' new season remains promising.

Wood, who averaged 16.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, and a 37.6% three-point shooting percentage last season, has the potential to be the biggest steal of this offseason. He is likely to follow in the footsteps of Malik Monk or Schroder and re-establish his reputation in one of the most spotlighted teams in the league, possibly earning himself a lucrative contract in the future. Furthermore, if James or Davis were to suffer injuries, Wood would have more opportunities and a more prominent role. However, this trade still carries some concerns. According to advanced statistics, Wood had the worst individual defensive rating among the Lakers' reserves last season. If he fails to find his place in the Lakers' system, the purple and gold army, with ambitions of winning their 18th championship, may not have the patience to wait for him to adapt.
