 Interview with the cutest sports anchor, Li Yihan - A sports jersey represents not only a team but also a spirit.

Li Yihan, currently working as a sports anchor on ETTV, recalls her first experience as an event host at an outdoor basketball game in Taoyuan. The game featured ANGO's innovative "glow-in-the-dark ball," which amazed her and left a deep impression of the ANGO brand.

During her time at Videoland Sports, Li Yihan noticed that teams like Taipower and Tatung were wearing ANGO jerseys during the Taiwan Enterprise Football League broadcasts. This sparked her interest in getting to know ANGO better and she discovered that ANGO is not just a sports equipment manufacturer, but also develops high-quality jerseys for both football and basketball, providing athletes with more options.

Continuing to read about the encounter between a new generation sports anchor and a new generation sports brand, what kind of new imagination will arise for the sports industry and Taiwan's sports industry? What does the perfect jersey look like in the eyes of a sports anchor? Despite being a new sports brand, ANGO jerseys not only have a refreshing design but also meet the needs of athletes with their moisture-wicking and quick-drying functions.

Seeing that Taiwan now has its own high-quality jersey brand, Li Yihan shared her vision of a perfect jersey: "The first thing you notice is the external design and color coordination. Then comes comfort, it should be able to absorb sweat, especially during intense matches where it's important for the jersey to have quick-drying functionality, so it can dry quickly after washing for the next day's game." During the interview, Li Yihan wore an ANGO jersey and praised it, saying, "I think ANGO has done a great job. Besides looking good and being comfortable to wear, they have also considered many details that girls care about, such as whether the jersey is see-through, if it provides adequate coverage, and whether the sleeveless part exposes the side of the chest."

Clearly, creating a good jersey is not an easy task. It requires not only maintaining high standards of quality and comfort but also considering the users' needs in the design process, which requires dedication from the brand.

Transitioning from the football industry to the basketball industry, ANGO's professional jerseys lead in high-end functionality and performance. Li Yihan, who has long been concerned about the sports industry, has been involved in basketball since high school and even joined her university's basketball team. Her first job after entering the professional world was as a sports journalist, showing her close relationship with sports.

Based on her personal experience and from a different perspective, Li Yihan understands the influence of sports brands. "I know that JHBL (Junior High Basketball League) collaborated with ANGO this year. They sponsored customized jerseys, warm-up outfits, and socks for the players, which I think is great. It not only means recognition for JHBL but also means that more people will see the strength of Taiwan's sports brand, creating a mutual support and mutual benefit."

Having experienced playing basketball during her student years, Li Yihan can empathize with the importance of sponsorship and encouragement for student teams. Therefore, she highly appreciates ANGO's support for grassroots sports, such as providing sponsored balls and jerseys. While ANGO initially focused on the football market, they have recently expanded into basketball, offering high-quality jerseys to more talented athletes, allowing them to perform at their best. Despite expanding their supply chain, ANGO maintains an environmentally friendly manufacturing process, which impresses Li Yihan and shows their commitment to environmental protection. Just like a perfect jersey should consider not only the athletes but also the entire industry ecosystem and manufacturing environment.

If they can maintain an environmentally friendly spirit, it will not only benefit the sports industry but also contribute to the Earth.

A jersey represents not only a team but also a spirit. Li Yihan, who has covered numerous sports events, chose to enter this field not only because of her fascination and curiosity about working in television but also because of her passion and love for sports. She has steadily progressed to where she is today, even earning the title of "cutest anchor," which fully reflects her innocence, enthusiasm, and professionalism in her work.

Enthusiasm and steadfastness have always been essential to the sports spirit. "I think work is similar to sports. You have to constantly improve your professionalism and skills." Li Yihan has a serious and determined demeanor. Despite being a public figure as an anchor, she is often scrutinized and subjected to online trolls and rumors. However, she is willing to change her mindset and continue to push herself. "My next goal is to improve my ability to broadcast sports events, especially my favorite basketball events. I also hope to one day step into the Olympic arena and report on Olympic events."

Li Yihan speaks passionately and confidently about her clear goals, as if preparing to shoot a basket, determined to rise and hit the bullseye. In the wet and cold December, let ANGO's cap T warm your heart.
