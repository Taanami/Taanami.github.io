 Coach La's aggressive reform of the development of high school level basketball in the 112th HBL competition regulations

The High School Athletic Association recently announced the competition regulations for the 112th High School Basketball League (HBL) for the A and B divisions. It was discovered that the announcement clause introduced in the 110th regulations, stating that "coaches must obtain at least a C-level coaching certificate starting from the 113th academic year," had quietly been modified to "coaches must obtain at least a C-level coaching certificate from the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association." This change will have a significant impact on the development of grassroots B division teams in high schools. Please continue reading for the 110th to 112th HBL competition regulations and the announcement clause for the coaching staff starting from the 113th academic year.

The High School Basketball League (HBL) is an annual high school basketball competition organized by the Chinese Taipei High School Sports Federation (referred to as the High School Athletic Association), commissioned by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China. It was established in 1988 and is divided into four divisions: Men's A division, Men's B division, Women's A division, and Women's B division. The HBL is currently the largest high school sports competition in the country in terms of the number of participating teams. For example, in the 111th academic year, there were 40 teams in the Men's A division, 17 teams in the Women's A division, 271 teams in the Men's B division, and 99 teams in the Women's B division, totaling 427 high school teams competing for the HBL championship, pursuing their youth, dreams, and sweat.

However, compared to the A division, which receives more media attention, the B division receives much less attention. Not only is the media coverage low, but resources from all sectors are also much less than in the A division. Although there are online media outlets such as "TGF Sports Team" and "BE HEROES" that report or broadcast B division games, for most teams that cannot make it to the top eight in the Northern or Southern region, their operations rely almost solely on "passion". 
Please continue reading for the changes in the number of B division teams in the HBL in the past four years (self-compiled data)
The number of B division teams participating in the HBL has gradually decreased from 395 teams in the 108th year to 370 teams in the 111th year, with a decrease of approximately 6.3% over four years. Among them, the B division women's teams experienced the largest decrease, with 18 fewer teams participating in the league, a decrease of 15.3%.

The factors contributing to the decrease in the number of B division teams in the league can be summarized as follows:
1. Some teams challenging the A division: For example, New Taipei City Jinhe High School, which participated in the B division before the 109th academic year, challenged the Men's A division starting from the 110th academic year; and Hsinchu High School, which won three consecutive championships in the B division from the 108th to the 110th academic year, challenged the Women's A division starting from the 111th academic year.

However, the number of teams challenging the A division from the B division in the past four years is actually not many, so it is not the main reason for the decrease in the number of participating teams. (Photo source: Sports Vision special photographer Shala)
2. Large disparity in B division strength: Unlike the University Basketball Association (UBA), where divisions are divided into Open Division 1, Open Division 2, and General Division (often referred to as A1, A2, A3), the high school basketball league does not have a similar division system. Open Division 1 and 2 have a promotion and relegation system and are primarily focused on student-athletes and students with excellent sports performance. The General Division is mainly composed of non-student-athletes and students from sports-related departments.

Supplement: UBA's regulations regarding player qualifications in the General Division and Open Division: The following individuals (including overseas students) should participate in the Open Division: (1) Students who have previously enrolled in sports-related departments. (2) Students who have been admitted to five-year colleges and junior colleges according to the excellent sports performance admission guidance regulations for secondary and higher education institutions, including bonus points for selection, examination, individual enrollment, and transfer exams (transfer students who were previously in the General Division or B division are not subject to this limitation). (3) Students who have been admitted based on sports specialty tests or non-basic physical fitness tests or sports performance. (4) Former players in the social A division organized by the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (before 2008) or non-basketball professional athletes. (5) Athletes who have been selected for national (or regional) representative teams in various competition categories during their time in high school, except for those participating in disabled sports competitions who do not fall under the restrictions of the first to fourth items of this article, may participate in the General Division. (6) Athletes who have participated in championships or internationally recognized competitions organized by international sports federations or have international rankings recognized by international sports federations during their time in high school. (7) Athletes who have achieved the top eight in national sports events, national secondary school sports events, or the designated cup competitions for college admission counseling by the Ministry of Education during their time in high school.
