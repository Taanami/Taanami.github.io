In the first game, Kaohsiung's Family Sea Gods defeated the defending champion Taipei Fubon Braves, and in the second game, T1 League's defending champion New Taipei Central Trust Special Forces faced the host Dreamers. In the end, led by Lin Junji's 25 points, Dreamers defeated Central Trust Special Forces 107-101, making both defending champions suffer defeat on the first day of the tournament.

The new season will challenge Central Trust Special Forces' two consecutive championships in the T1 League. In today's Dreamers Invitational Tournament, with 3 main players, Abasi, Tseng Wending, and Lin Weihan, all absent, the two teams also played a highly intense and fierce game. In the first quarter, Central Trust Special Forces opened fire, especially the young big man Tan Jielong, who performed impressively in last week's T1 League warm-up game. In the first quarter, he scored 10 points on 4 shots, including 2 three-pointers, helping Central Trust Special Forces to score 37 points in the first quarter.

However, Dreamers also performed well today. Local guard Lin Junji scored 11 points in the first half and even had a cooperation with foreign player Bryce in an alley-oop dunk. This helped Dreamers keep up with Central Trust Special Forces, and in the third quarter, a conflict between Dreamers' foreign player McKel and Central Trust Special Forces' foreign player Flyck occurred, resulting in McKel being expelled. The two teams continued to pull each other until they were tied until the last 2 minutes of the game. However, after Lin Junji made both free throws, Central Trust Special Forces made a fatal mistake, allowing Dreamers' Berzanishvili to score a three-pointer. Later, Walker added another crucial cold arrow, allowing Dreamers to take an 8-point lead in the final 51 seconds, ultimately defeating Central Trust Special Forces by 6 points. Both teams in the Dual League won 1 game on the first day of the tournament. Dreamers' Lin Junji had the best performance with 25 points and 5 assists, while returning player Bryce scored 17 points. As for Central Trust Special Forces, Tan Jielong scored 16 points and 6 rebounds, and Flyck had an all-around performance of 13 points, 9 rebounds, and 9 assists.
