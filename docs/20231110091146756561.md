 Former Goyang Sono Skygunners player, Anthony Bennet, who had previously joined the Korean Basketball League (KBL) as a former NBA top pick for the Fubon Braves, has been released by the team. The reason for his departure has recently been revealed. According to a report by Korean blogger Alloverbasketball, Bennet did not participate in any training activities during the off-season and did not maintain a good physical condition. Even completing team practices was difficult for him, leading to his release from the team. It was previously reported that Bennet earned a monthly salary of $43,750 in the KBL and only played in 17 games for the Fubon Braves last season, averaging 22.6 points, 12.2 rebounds, 2.9 assists, and 3.3 steals per game.
