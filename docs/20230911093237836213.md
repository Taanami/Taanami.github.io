NBA Denver Nuggets forward Michael Porter Jr. came to Taiwan to participate in a charity event. Today, he was invited to throw the first pitch for the Chinatrust Brothers baseball team. Unexpectedly, there was an incident involving a fan who rushed onto the field and embraced Porter. Despite the surprise encounter, Porter remained friendly and shook hands with the fan. However, the fan was subsequently chased by staff members, and Porter shouted, "Run, my boy!" 

Porter was invited to Taiwan to engage in a series of charity activities. The highlight was throwing the first pitch for the Chinatrust Brothers baseball team. The game was delayed due to rain, but Porter still took the opportunity to throw the first pitch. However, before the pitch, a fan made a sudden and unexpected move.

During an interview with host Xiao Bai, Porter was suddenly interrupted by a man in white who rushed onto the field, arms open wide, and tightly embraced Porter. Xiao Bai and the translator quickly pushed the man away, while Porter maintained a smile and shook hands with the fan in response.

The man in white managed to escape from the control of the staff members and ran around the field. Upon seeing this, Porter laughed and said, "Run, my boy, run!" Finally, the fan's intrusion came to an end. Porter continued the interview, expressing his happiness to be there and excitement about throwing the first pitch. He jokingly warned the audience to be careful as he expected to throw the ball quickly. Before the game, Porter also learned a few moves from Brother's pitching coach, Eddie Tan, hoping to showcase them to the fans. In the end, he did put in effort to throw the ball with force, but due to a wrong angle, it landed prematurely, bouncing into the hands of the catcher, Zhou Sizhi.
