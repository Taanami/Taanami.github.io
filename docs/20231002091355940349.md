New Taipei Kings, in preparation for the new season and the Eastern Super League, announced on September 8th that they have signed power forward Billy Preston from the United States, making him the third import player for the Forbidden Guards. It is hoped that Billy, who is young but has experience playing in multiple professional basketball leagues, can contribute to the Forbidden Guards on both ends of the court.

Billy hails from California and is currently 25 years old, standing at a height of 208 centimeters. He was selected as a five-star high school player during his student years and received recruitment offers from prestigious NCAA school, the University of Kansas. His remarkable athleticism is his trademark, and he also possesses excellent shooting skills from the outside. His exceptional ability to penetrate often leads to creating good scoring opportunities. In 2018, he entered the NBA draft but did not receive much attention. Subsequently, he played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the summer league and signed a two-way contract to play for their G League team, the Cleveland Charge. This marked the beginning of his professional career. He then played in various overseas professional leagues, most recently playing for the Cape Town Tigers in the South African Basketball League, where he averaged 16.6 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. Regarding Billy's signing, General Manager Mao Gaen said, "Billy can be considered a modern-day stretch four player. He possesses excellent athletic ability and has the skills to both cut and shoot, making him a formidable offensive threat. His agility and height also provide the Forbidden Guards with defensive intensity. At only 25 years old, he is a young player with unlimited potential. We are very excited to see how he combines with Mulens and Manny in the upcoming season, and we believe he will bring more flexibility to the Kings' lineup and help the team achieve even better results."
