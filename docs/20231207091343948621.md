 In a recent announcement, it was revealed that the U16 Asian Youth Basketball Championship, which was scheduled to be held in Qatar from September 17th to 24th, will not include our country's representative team. This decision was made by the East Asian Basketball Association without any prior discussions with other member countries. Instead of using a qualification match, the association decided to use rankings to determine the participating teams, which ultimately resulted in our country being ranked fourth in East Asia and unable to participate in the championship. The Basketball Association has already filed a protest against this decision.

In the past, out of the 16 participating teams in the U16 Asian Youth Championship, the host country and defending champion automatically qualify, while the West Asia, East Asia, and Persian Gulf regions each have two spots, and the remaining three regions and Oceania have one spot each. The remaining four spots are determined based on the performance of each region in the previous championship. However, this year, the East Asian region was granted "2+1" spots. Secretary-General of the Chinese Basketball Association, Li Yunxiang, explained that they did not receive any information about the championship and after inquiring with other participating countries and contacting the Asian Basketball Confederation, they were informed that each region's participation is determined by the respective regional basketball associations. However, the East Asian region, without a meeting with the other member countries, decided to use rankings instead of a qualification match to determine the participating teams. As a result, our country was unable to participate as we were ranked behind China, Japan, and South Korea in the East Asian region.

Li Yunxiang emphasized that this decision by the East Asian Basketball Association was made without the knowledge of other member countries, including Hong Kong and Macau. South Korea and Japan only found out that our country was not on the list during a U16 video conference. This prompted the Basketball Association to file a protest and request the meeting records. The Secretary-General of the Macau Basketball Association, Hu Shufen, who also serves as the Secretary-General of the East Asian Basketball Association, personally apologized for the situation. However, it was too late to change the fact that our country will not be participating in the championship this year. The coaching staff and some members of our U16 representative team had recently participated in the East Asian Youth Games in Ulaanbaatar, where they won a silver medal. To prevent this news from affecting the players' morale, the Basketball Association only informed them of the possibility of not participating in the championship after the tournament. They also proposed the possibility of participating in other competitions to continue training, but with the HBL qualification games approaching, many schools want their players to return early.
