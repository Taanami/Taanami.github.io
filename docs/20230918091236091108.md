  Germany Dominates to Claim Victory at the 2023 World Cup

In a thrilling showdown, Germany emerged victorious over the five-time world champions, the United States, in the semi-finals of the 2023 World Cup. The final will see Germany face off against another five-time world champion, Serbia. Please continue reading.

In the 2019 World Cup final, Argentina faced Spain, taking an early lead and never falling behind. However, Argentina's star player, Lu√≠s Scola, had a lackluster performance in what turned out to be his final World Cup game. Spain ultimately won the championship with a 20-point lead. The script was different in this year's final, as Serbia never gave up despite a double-digit deficit in the third quarter. They even had a chance to tie the game with a three-point shot, but unfortunately missed. In the end, Germany's Dennis Schroder displayed his disruptive skills once again, driving to the basket and widening the lead to four points, sealing the victory.

The first half of the game was a back-and-forth battle, with the score tied at 47. However, Serbia faced a significant disadvantage when their key defender, Ognjen Dobric, injured his ankle and couldn't return to the game. Serbia's depth was evident in the semi-finals against Canada, where they rotated ten players, with even the shortest playing time being close to ten minutes.

With eight intense games in a short period, managing physical stamina was crucial. Dobric's absence, who possessed the qualities of defensive prowess, mobility, and height, left Serbia lacking in countering Germany's tall front line. Such a high-intensity game can make a significant difference with one player missing, especially considering Dobric's strong presence on the court. Please continue reading.

A key moment occurred in the third quarter when Germany's head coach, Gordon Herbert, boldly utilized center Johannes Voigtmann to directly challenge Serbia's main center, Nikola Milutinov. This strategy proved effective as Serbia struggled with their inside attacks, allowing Germany to expand their perimeter defense and suppress Serbia's outside firepower.

Serbia failed to score any three-pointers in the entire quarter, only managing 10 points, giving Germany a significant advantage.

In the fourth quarter, Serbia attempted a comeback led by guard Aleksa Avramovic. While constantly chasing Schroder on defense, Avramovic made three crucial three-pointers and scored 16 points in the quarter, coming close to helping his team even the score.

Serbia's ace guard, Bogdan Bogdanovic, was the main reason for their competitiveness in the first half. However, Germany's defensive strategy in the second half, focusing on double-teaming Bogdanovic, limited his impact. He only attempted two shots and made one basket in the entire second half. In addition to Bogdanovic, their second-leading scorer, center Milutinov, failed to make an impact in the second half, and N. Jovic only made one basket. Losing these three key scoring options rendered Serbia's comeback attempts ineffective.

Serbia had been the team with the fewest turnovers and allowed the fewest fast break points in the tournament, showcasing their excellent ball control and low scoring from turnovers. However, in the final against Germany, they were not as fortunate. Germany had a slight advantage in rebounds, and both teams had a similar three-point shooting percentage. The turning point came in the third quarter when Serbia committed 12 turnovers, with Germany capitalizing on 9 of them. Germany gained 19 points from turnovers, while Serbia only managed 12. In such a closely contested game, scoring from turnovers made the difference.

Franz Wagner's shooting accuracy was not particularly impressive in this game. However, his height, agility, and ability to penetrate caused significant trouble for Serbia's defense, leading to numerous trips to the free-throw line.

With 11 free-throw attempts, 4 offensive rebounds, and 3 steals, Wagner unexpectedly but deservedly became the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the championship game. Schroder's relentless drives to the basket throughout the game, along with his 10 free-throw attempts, added to the damage Germany inflicted on Serbia. Except for a poor shooting performance against Latvia, Schroder consistently provided stable offensive output for the team, with a maximum of 10 assists in a single game.

He undoubtedly served as the backbone of Germany's backcourt, providing the most reliable ball handling and attacking options. His disruptive abilities were evident in both guarding against smaller opponents and facing off against bigger players. Ultimately, he was awarded the MVP of the tournament. Germany's first challenge for the world championship ended in success, while Serbia suffered their third consecutive defeat in a world-class basketball final.

Apart from the Olympics and the World Cup, Serbia's last European championship title came in 2001, competing as part of Yugoslavia.

Serbia is undoubtedly a basketball powerhouse, but it has been a long time since they lifted the ultimate trophy in top-tier FIBA competitions. Perhaps this will increase Nikola Jokic's chances of participating in the Olympics?
