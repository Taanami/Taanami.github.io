Yesterday, Bucks guard Jrue Holiday gave an interview where he was asked about his willingness to re-sign with the team, considering that he only has one year left on his contract.

"I think I've said before that I will always be a part of the Bucks. I don't want to play for any other team. I believe that we have the opportunity to continue doing great things as a team and as an organization, so I want to stay in Milwaukee," said Jrue Holiday. "I've had the best three seasons of my career with the Bucks, not only that, but we have a winning record and have become a top team or a top three team. Before I came to the Bucks, I didn't think I would stay with a team that has consistently been in the top three of the league."

However, in a blockbuster three-team trade completed this morning, Damian Lillard was sent to the Bucks, and as part of the deal, Jrue Holiday was traded from the Bucks to the Trail Blazers. According to subsequent reports from ESPN, sources revealed that the Trail Blazers will be looking to engage in trade talks with strong teams in the league to move Holiday, with potential destinations being the Celtics and the Heat.
