  The NBA player Dwight Howard has been accused of sexual assault and illegal confinement by a man named Stephen Harper from Georgia. Harper filed a civil lawsuit in July, claiming that Howard and another man sexually assaulted him, physically assaulted him, illegally confined him, and intentionally caused him emotional distress. This week, Howard denied these allegations through his lawyer and requested that the court dismiss the case.

 According to Harper's lawyer, Harper and Howard met on Instagram and exchanged explicit messages. They agreed to meet at Howard's home in Gwinnett County on July 19, 2021. However, on the way to Howard's home, Howard asked if another man or woman could join them, to which Harper replied that he was not interested. Despite this, when Harper arrived at Howard's home, he found another man dressed as a woman who introduced himself as "Kitty" present.

 Harper claims that he tried to resist, but was forced by Howard and the other man to engage in sexual act
