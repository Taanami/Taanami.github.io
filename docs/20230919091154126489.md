 The Portrait of Jordan in his Nike Era: Jordan's Time at UNC

In the previous articles, we discussed the early years of Michael Jordan, the iconic figure who wore Nike shoes and was often referred to as the "Jesus of Basketball." During his time at the University of North Carolina (UNC), Jordan faced challenges and opportunities that shaped his career.

When Jordan first joined UNC, ESPN had just begun broadcasting basketball games, and coverage was not as extensive as it is today. Additionally, UNC's offensive strategy focused more on teamwork rather than individual performances, making it difficult for people to witness Jordan's incredible offensive skills. Nonetheless, stories of Jordan's legendary abilities circulated among basketball scouts, assistant coaches, journalists, and dedicated UNC fans. They claimed to have witnessed Jordan's amazing moves in Chapel Hill or saw him dominate opponents in games.

Dean Smith, the head coach at UNC, recognized Jordan's potential and was pleased with his progress. However, he believed that Jordan had not yet achieved enough to be featured on the cover of a sports magazine. When the Sports Illustrated magazine requested to feature four of UNC's starting players on their preseason special issue, Smith agreed but specifically excluded Jordan. He explained his decision to Jordan, stating that the other players had proven their worth, but Jordan had yet to make a significant impact.

As a result, when the magazine was released, only Sam Perkins, James Worthy, Matt Doherty, and Jimmy Black appeared on the cover. Interestingly, when UNC won the NCAA national championship that season, Jordan finally made an appearance on the magazine cover. 

During the 1981-82 season, UNC reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament. They defeated the University of Houston, led by Clyde Drexler and Akeem Olajuwon (later known as Hakeem Olajuwon), in a close game. In the championship game, UNC faced Georgetown University, which was considered one of the strongest teams in college basketball. The matchup between UNC and Georgetown was often seen as a battle between black and white players, with Dean Smith and John Thompson, the head coach of Georgetown, representing different racial backgrounds. However, Smith and Thompson were good friends, and both teams emphasized discipline and academic success for their players.

Georgetown's standout player was center Patrick Ewing, known for his size, strength, and speed. Despite Ewing's dominance, UNC players remained confident and well-prepared. The game showcased Georgetown's aggressive defense against UNC's well-coordinated teamwork. Ewing's defensive efforts led to several goaltending calls against him, frustrating UNC. However, UNC's James Worthy had a remarkable performance, scoring 28 points on 13 of 17 shooting. Although Jordan's offensive skills were not as sharp as Worthy's at that time, he contributed with 9 rebounds and showed no fear against formidable opponents like Ewing.

In the final minutes of the game, with UNC leading by just one point, Dean Smith instructed the team to slow down the pace and consume the remaining time. However, Jordan saw an opportunity and made a daring move towards the basket. He switched the ball from his right hand to his left, avoiding Ewing's defense, and released a high-arcing shot that gracefully dropped into the basket.

UNC emerged victorious with a final score of 63-62, securing the national championship. This game further solidified Jordan's reputation as a rising star and showcased his ability to perform under pressure. Despite his still-developing skills, Jordan's impact on the court was undeniable, and his journey was only just beginning.
