 Introducing TSF - The Skills Factory from Atlanta, USA, a highly regarded basketball preparatory school that focuses on developing the potential of athletes. Founded in 2011, TSF offers age-specific and skill-based training, as well as individual physical training and competitions to help athletes reach their full potential. Many NBA stars, such as James Harden, Trae Young, and Kemba Walker, have trained at TSF during their off-season. The school has successfully helped more than 200 students enter high school and college in the US, with over 100 of them playing in NCAA Division I. TSF also has a team of international players, including Isaiah Collier (USC), Cam Kraft (Xavier), Aguek Arop (SDSU), and Kai Sotto (Philippines). This year, TSF will be participating in the Longteng Cup International High School Basketball Tournament in Taiwan for the first time, bringing a team of talented players from different states in the US. This will be a great opportunity for cultural exchange and competition. Stay tuned for more updates on TSF's performance at the tournament.
