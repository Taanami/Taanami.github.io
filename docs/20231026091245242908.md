Introduction The 2022-23 season was undoubtedly a disappointment for the Toronto Raptors. After making it to the Eastern Conference playoffs as a top six team the previous year, they even managed to put up a fight against the 76ers in a six-game series despite being plagued with injuries. However, with all their key players returning, the Raptors only managed to finish as the ninth seed in the East, and were even embarrassed by losing their first play-in game to the Bulls.

The season was full of ups and downs, with the team often blowing leads in the fourth quarter and reports of locker room disputes.

In the end, with the team's underwhelming performance, head coach Nick Nurse left and longtime starting point guard Fred VanVleet departed for Houston, signaling the start of a new era for the Raptors.

With the confirmation of Darko Rajakovic as the team's head coach, the Raptors are expected to play a different style of offense in the upcoming season.

Under Nurse, the team's offense relied heavily on creating mismatches for their star players to score, resulting in players like Pascal Siakam and VanVleet dominating the ball and other players standing around waiting for passes.

However, Rajakovic, although inexperienced in the NBA, has shown in preseason games that his offense will focus on "spacing" and "ball movement."

In the preseason, the Raptors have often used a 5-out formation, with even center Jakob Poeltl stationed on the perimeter despite not being a threat from outside. Rajakovic has designed numerous weak-side handoffs to create open shots for his players, taking advantage of Poeltl's screening abilities. This has become the team's main offensive strategy, with the ball constantly moving and players finding the best opportunities to shoot.

On the defensive end, the team struggled with their switching defense in the past few seasons, but with the addition of Poeltl, they now have more flexibility on that end of the floor. Poeltl is skilled at both hedging on pick-and-rolls and dropping back to defend the paint, reminiscent of former Raptor Marc Gasol. His presence in the paint is also a great deterrent for opposing players.

Although the team lost VanVleet, who was known for his strong defense despite his height, Schröder is also adept at navigating screens, making for a seamless transition in defensive strategies.

Additionally, with their focus on stockpiling big men, the team acquired McDaniels, who has shown promise on both ends of the court in the preseason. 

Weaknesses While the title mentions weaknesses for the upcoming season, this has been a recurring issue for the Raptors for the past few years, which is their three-point shooting.

Last season, the team shot a dismal 33.5% from beyond the arc, ranking third worst in the league. Only Anunoby and Gary Trent Jr. were consistent threats from the perimeter, leading to a lack of space for the big men to cut into.

The team only acquired one of the best shooters in this year's draft, Dick, who shot over 40% from three in college. However, it remains to be seen if he can quickly adapt to the longer NBA three-point line and the faster defense, as he struggled in the summer league, shooting only 29.6% from three.

Furthermore, the team can only hope for a comeback from Otto Porter Jr., who has been injured for almost a year. On a different note, with the coaching staff undergoing changes and a more fluid offensive system, the team's former top players like Siakam will have to adjust to sharing the ball more. Although Siakam started his career as a hustle player without the ball, he has grown accustomed to being the primary scorer for the team. It will be interesting to see how he adapts to a different pace and continues to use his versatile skillset and improved passing to help the team. 

Key Variables The most crucial variable for the upcoming season will be the front office. Despite usually having a relaxed and jovial media day, there was a sense of unease this year. Both Siakam and Anunoby have been the subject of trade rumors, and with the team's focus seemingly shifting towards building around Barnes, it is possible that neither player will remain on the team by the end of the season. As a versatile player who can contribute on both ends of the court, Siakam's skills are a luxury for a team looking to make a championship push, while Anunoby's elite defense and consistent three-point shooting make him a valuable asset for any playoff team.

Moreover, the team may also look to acquire another impact player through trades to help Barnes and Poeltl lead the team. Overall, the 2022-23 season will not only be a fresh start for the Raptors but also a season full of uncertainties and challenges. Let's wait and see how it all unfolds.
