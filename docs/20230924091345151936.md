  2023 TGF Firefighting Cup Basketball Tournament Player Interview - Zhang Chenshuo

This year, the highlight of the North District inter-school group was none other than Dong Mo from Linbei Junior High School. Among them, Zhang Chenshuo, who won the scoring king and steals king in the finals, attracted a lot of attention for the team. In the preliminary round championship game, he scored 40 points with 9 three-pointers, setting a new scoring record for this year's tournament and winning the MVP. In addition, he averaged 29.7 points per game in the finals, leaving a deep impression with his outstanding individual performance. It was a great memory for the team to finish as national runners-up in their first participation in the tournament, and it was the best graduation gift for this special group of people. Please continue reading for more details about the composition of the inter-school group.

Regarding the composition of the team in this inter-school group, Zhang Chenshuo said, "Some of our team members are players from the A-level qualification games, while others are friends of teammates. The team was formed by Xu Junxiang from our team, and we all got to know each other through playing basketball or in A-level competitions." With the spirit of making friends through basketball, they came together by chance and cherished the opportunity.

For Zhang Chenshuo, participating in the Firefighting Cup for the first time was a fulfilling experience. He sincerely said, "The Firefighting Cup is really a tournament worth signing up for. It is like a league with many individual awards, which represents recognition for each player and can boost their confidence. I am very grateful to my teammates for inviting me to play in this tournament. It not only allowed me to meet more friends but also brought back the feeling of playing in a competition, which I haven't experienced for a long time. Finally, we advanced to the nationals and finished in 4th place. I hope my teammates will continue to work hard towards their goals. If there is a chance, we must gather again to play basketball. Thank you all. This is the happiest thing for me this year."

Compared to the league, the Firefighting Cup brings a different experience to the players, especially in the inter-school group where they don't have a coach's guidance. Therefore, they need to quickly judge how to attack and defend on the court. Through this unique experience, they learned on-the-spot reactions and effective communication within the team, making the team a group of people moving forward together, rather than just individual players. 

After graduating from high school this year, Zhang Chenshuo is looking forward to participating in the senior group next year. He confidently said, "If there is a chance next year, I will definitely come back to play in the senior group. I hope to win FMVP again, then advance to the nationals and finally win the national championship!"

Perhaps the runners-up result was not perfect for them, but for Zhang Chenshuo himself, his joy is evident. The full trust given to him by his teammates allowed him to fully unleash his potential, which is also a heartwarming aspect of this Firefighting Cup. We look forward to their return next year, continuing to create more unique memories on the battlefield of the Firefighting Cup.
