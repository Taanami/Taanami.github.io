  Appreciation and Reflection on the Efforts of the Chinese Men's Basketball Team at the Unfavorable Hangzhou Asian Games

The journey of the Chinese Men's Basketball Team at the Hangzhou Asian Games, as seen in "Hangzhou Asian Games-22", might not have been expected to reach the final day after the group stage performance. However, with changes in the lineup, mindset adjustments, and proactive actions, the path to the podium gradually emerged.

Although they fell short of the gold medal match, they were able to compete for the bronze medal against China. In the first half, both teams had their ups and downs, but a turning point emerged in the third quarter when Zhao Rui and Zhao Jiwei teamed up to push the tempo and use high-pressure defense to suppress the Chinese team's offense. In the end, they won the bronze medal with a 28-point difference, leaving us with regrets. Please continue reading ▼

Lin Tingqian fought hard in the first half, but the imbalance in offense and defense in the second half led to defeat.

Detailed game report: In the bronze medal match of the Hangzhou Asian Games, China used the same starting lineup as their first encounter against the Chinese team's newly formed lineup. In the first quarter, both teams had multiple players contributing to the score, with no focus on a single player. The score kept rising, and the lead changed hands several times. However, Lin Tingqian emerged at the end of the quarter, scoring 7 points on his own to give his team an 8-point lead.

In the second quarter, the Chinese team managed to maintain their lead in the first five minutes. However, Zhao Rui and Cui Yongxi managed to tie the score, and with the help of Zhao Jiwei's two consecutive three-pointers, they regained the lead. The following exchanges of blows occurred, and with Liu Zheng's three-pointers, the Chinese team entered halftime with a 3-point lead. 

The second half witnessed a change in the game. China, abandoning the inside presence, played with a fast-paced offensive rhythm. Zhao Rui and Zhao Jiwei connected with Hu Jinqiu to form a strong trio, frequently tearing apart the Chinese team's defense from both inside and outside. They regained the lead and quickly extended the lead. The high-pressure defense forced the Chinese team to rely on outside shooting, making inaccurate shot choices. They only scored 10 points on 17 attempts in the quarter, causing a sudden shift in momentum. In the final quarter, China stabilized the situation with Zhang Zhenlin. Although the Chinese team managed to score, it was not enough to catch up with the opponent's momentum. The game ended with substitutions on both sides, and China ultimately won the bronze medal with a score of 101:73. The Chinese team finished the tournament in fourth place for the second consecutive time.

Please continue reading: In this game, no player from the Chinese team had a positive plus/minus value. Lin Tingqian scored 20 points, the highest on the team, while Liu Zheng, Ater Majok, and Abass had double-digit scores. With a poor shooting percentage and losing the rebound battle by 13, it was difficult for the team to achieve victory.

In contrast, China performed excellently in the fast-paced third quarter, with five players scoring in double digits. Cui Yongxi scored 20 points, Zhao Jiwei contributed 12 points and 8 assists, and Zhao Rui added 17 points and 5 assists. With the support of 13 three-pointers, their focus and execution in the second half were impeccable, leaving no room for doubt about winning the bronze medal.

▼ Despite being underestimated, they fought hard until the end. Despite the disadvantage in the lineup, the Chinese men's basketball team finished the Hangzhou Asian Games tournament yesterday. The Philippines advanced to the gold medal match by reversing the game against China and defeating the towers of Jordan and their main scorer, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, to win the Asian Games gold medal after a 61-year gap. Jordan achieved their best-ever silver medal result after strengthening their team with naturalized players in recent years. China won the bronze medal, while the Chinese team finished in fourth place. It is not easy to maintain form throughout the tournament and achieve good results. Jordan was expected to win the gold undefeated, but they were ultimately defeated by the Philippines, who easily defeated them in the group stage. The Chinese team fought hard but fell short against China, who only lost to the Philippines. The Philippines, on the other hand, produced a great surprise, overcoming two difficult challenges to claim victory, making this tournament full of surprises and unpredictable outcomes. Please continue reading: When it comes to the bronze medal match, we have to look at the third quarter when China replaced Wang Zhelin with Hu Jinqiu. Hu's quick and decisive offensive moves and unclear defensive assignments in one-on-one situations tore apart the defense in the paint, leading to China's success. With the inside presence established, there was more space for outside shooting, and their three-pointers hitting the mark repeatedly dealt a heavy blow to us. 

The Chinese team's struggle can be attributed not only to the loss of defensive rhythm but also, in the author's opinion, to several unfavorable calls that had an impact. There were many instances of minor actions by the Chinese team, such as pulling shirts and pushing opponents, which resulted in disadvantages for us. The offense lacked effective strategies and often resorted to hasty shots from the perimeter, which allowed China to tighten their defense. It was difficult for Ater Majok and Zeng Wen to score in the low post, and the score stagnated, making a comeback in the final quarter challenging.

Although they ultimately failed to win a medal, the Chinese men's basketball team deserves appreciation for their performance throughout the tournament. From overcoming the lack of a point guard to facing challenges in the group stage, successfully dealing with Japan's fast-paced style of play, losing to Jordan's three towers, and finally finishing fourth after two defeats against China, their efforts are commendable. Of course, they have received criticism, and after the group stage, most people did not have high expectations for their progress, believing that losing to Japan would be the end. However, in the end, it is the game that determines the outcome. Even with an imperfect lineup, their full determination and efforts are still worthy of pride. ▼ With a few surprises, a strong starting lineup can cultivate reliable reinforcements.
