 Bologna head coach Scariolo criticizes team's policies and is fired, replaced by Latvian coach Banchi

Sergio Scariolo, the current coach of the Spanish national team, has been dismissed from his position as head coach of Virtus Segafredo Bologna, a top team in the Italian Basketball League (LBA). He will be replaced by Luca Banchi, the current coach of the Latvian national team. This decision has caused quite a stir before the start of the new season.

Scariolo's dismissal was surprising in timing, as his relationship with the team has been strained for a long time. It is rumored that external interference has been affecting the team's performance. Scariolo was considered a top candidate for the head coach position of the Toronto Raptors, and even had a video conference with them during the Italian league championship series. The breaking point came when the team's budget was reduced, as the European league implemented a financial fair play policy, forcing Bologna to significantly cut their budget and release several players whose contracts had expired.

During a press conference on Wednesday (September 13th), Scariolo's words sparked a lot of discussion. He stated that the team's roster decisions were mostly made by the club and refused to answer questions about the team's goals for the new season, saying they should be directed to the management. However, after hearing these remarks, most of Bologna's shareholders were dissatisfied and decided to dismiss the coach. According to internal sources, almost everyone in the club believed that Scariolo would be fired. On Friday morning, Bologna released a press release announcing the termination of Scariolo's contract. The press release also stated that Scariolo's remarks to the media on September 13th, 2023, and his statements at a press conference after the end of the season on June 27th, were major reasons for his dismissal.

After firing Scariolo, Bologna quickly announced that they had reached an agreement with Luca Banchi to be the new head coach, with a two-year contract.

Banchi has previously served as head coach for several teams, including Siena and EA7 Emporio Armani Milan. He led Latvia to a fifth-place finish at this year's World Cup and was awarded the Best Coach award.

Interestingly, Banchi's Latvia team had faced Scariolo's Spanish team in the World Cup, with Latvia ultimately winning and keeping Spain out of the quarter-finals. This sudden change in European basketball coaching has sparked widespread discussion among the public.
