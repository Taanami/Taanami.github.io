  最後，就是塞爾提克的薪資空間，我想應該是老闆不願意再多繳那1.4M的奢侈稅，就儘快把Williams III送走吧。不過，我也要提出最後的疑問，為什麼會選擇送出Williams III而不是Payton Pritchard？我想或許是因為Pritchard還在球隊的計畫中，但Williams III卻沒有，所以還是選擇把他送走。

 總而言之，這次的交易對塞爾提克來說是一次巨大的改變，球隊的陣容、薪資空間都受到了影響，而這也讓球迷們充滿了疑惑與不安。希望這次的交易能夠為球隊帶來更多的穩定性與勝利，讓我們拭目以待新賽季的到來。The Green Blood Ubon Trade: It's Time for a Holiday

The holiday trade has brought changes to the Celtics.

Team Roster and Salary: After the trade and signing of Gabriel, the team salary has exceeded the Super-Tax Apron. However, some restrictions and penalties will not take effect until next year, so it depends on how much the owner is willing to pay for the luxury tax this year. The Celtics now have four players with salaries in the 30 million range, and the depth of the bench has decreased compared to last year.

Team Salary: 1. Jrue Holiday - $36,861,7072. Kristaps Porzingis - $36,016,2003. Jayson Tatum - $32,600,0604. Jaylen Brown - $31,830,3575. Derrick White - $18,357,1436. Al Horford - $10,000,0007. Payton Pritchard - $4,037,2788. Luke Kornet - $2,413,304 (non-guaranteed)9. Oshae Brissett - $2,165,00010. Svi Mykhailiuk - $2,019,706 (non-guaranteed)11. Dalano Banton - $2,019,706 (non-guaranteed)12. Sam Hauser - $1,927,89613. Jordan Walsh - $1,119,563-------------------------------------------------- ------The total salary of these 13 players》$181,367,9202023 Super-Tax Apron》$182,794,00-------------------------------------------------- ------The total salary of these thirteen players is only 1.4M away from the Super-Tax Apron. Even a minimum salary space is not enough. Basically, unless the team decompresses players through trades, it will inevitably exceed the Super-Tax Apron. This is also the reason why I don't think it's like Stevens. According to the owner Wyc's past style, even if he gives the green light, he may not do it to this extent. Everyone understands that the window for winning the championship is fleeting, but the risk is still too great to do this. From Brown's contract extension to the KP trade, I still believe that the team is willing to make changes while considering the depth of the team. Is it really because of the Bucks' reinforcement that they feel a sense of crisis? It's worth everyone to think about.

Team Roster: The team can bring 20 players into training camp. Currently, in addition to 13 formal contracts, the three two-way contracts have also been confirmed. The remaining four training camp contracts will determine the remaining player positions. Currently, the team has signed three training camp contracts, L. Stevens, W. Gabriel, and K. Kelley. The first two are Exhibit 9 contracts, and the latter is an Exhibit 10 contract. It is expected that the remaining player positions will be filled by the first two.

The preseason training camp has already begun, so there may not be any more signings of training camp contracts. In order to maintain the flexibility of the roster, only one of the two will probably be chosen to fill the 14th player position. Originally, I would have chosen Stevens without hesitation, but now that there is a gap in the frontcourt, Gabriel has an advantage. However, I don't think he can have much impact on defense in the frontcourt. I would rather believe in Kornet's abilities.

Impact of M.Brogdon & R.Williams III leaving: Although Brogdon won the Sixth Man of the Year award last year, and he is indeed an efficient scorer, his stability on the court and ability to make the right decisions are important assets for the bench.

But he didn't perform as well in organization as others expected. Of course, it's not all his fault. He is able to organize the offense through pick and rolls, but this is not the Celtics' usual tactic, nor is it the most efficient tactic. For me, Brogdon's better performance is his cutting and three-point shooting. His cutting speed and finishing may not have many tricks, but his dribble penetration is sharp, and his three-point shooting is at the top level in the league. With his position and salary, we can't ask for more, but he won't be the one to take the ball in crucial moments and command the offense like everyone expects.

As for Williams III, that is the key reason why I don't agree with this trade. First of all, he has a three-year contract with an average of only 12M, which is definitely not a player who will be restricted by salary. Secondly, he finally established his value in the previous season. Although he had surgery on his meniscus, he still had a huge impact on defense in the frontcourt. Not to mention his potential in playmaking and outside shooting. I don't think his injury is the reason why the team sent him away so soon.

Especially with the arrival of Porzingis, it is obvious that Horford will have to take a step back, allowing Williams III to reduce his burden and exert his defensive ability. Now, after Horford, there is no one who can handle the frontcourt.

Finally, it's about the Celtics' salary space. I think it's because the owner doesn't want to pay that extra 1.4M in luxury tax, so they decided to send Williams III away as soon as possible. However, I also have a final question, why choose to send Williams III instead of Payton Pritchard? Perhaps it's because Pritchard is still part of the team's plans, but Williams III is not, so they chose to send him away.

In conclusion, this trade is a huge change for the Celtics. The team's roster and salary space have been affected, which has left fans with doubts and concerns. Hopefully, this trade will bring stability and success to the team, and we can look forward to the upcoming new season.
