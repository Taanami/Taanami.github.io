  Chang Yao Cup - The Constant and Silent Cultivator from Miaoli Mingren Junior High School, Coach Qiu Guo-da

"I love the process of building the future for children." Please continue reading about the coach, Qiu Guo-da, who took over as the head coach of the Mingren Junior High School men's basketball team in 1996. From the beginning until now, he has been steadfast for nearly 30 years, never forgetting his original intention to focus on education and nurturing, regardless of fame or fortune. Growing up as a player, he became a coach after finishing his student years, and now looking back, Coach Qiu admits that he never thought he would stay in this role for decades.

In this long period of time, we can see the changes in the domestic and international basketball environment, but what remains unchanged is his commitment to grassroots basketball. Many of the outstanding basketball players seen on the current stage, such as professional players Guan Dayou, Lee Jiakang, Lu Junxiang, Lu Jieming, UBA players Song Xinhao, Liu Lushi, Zhang Jiecheng, Peng Guanlun, HBL players Cai Chenghan, Chen Guanzhong, Quan Yi, Zhang Junyao, 2023 World University Games player Zhang Zhenya, and CBA top pick Chen Yingjun, all came from his cradle.

And the achievements of Mingren Junior High School in the JBHL are self-evident. Coach Qiu has been cultivating grassroots basketball at Mingren Junior High School for nearly 30 years.

"A tree with deep roots will not be swayed by the wind." Having a strong foundation during student years is crucial for future success. Furthermore, Coach Qiu has been quietly helping underprivileged children, embodying the true meaning of education without class distinctions. "The needs of grassroots basketball can be divided into hardware and software. Hardware includes venues, training environment, and funding sources, which can create urban-rural disparities. It is important for coaches promoting grassroots basketball to bridge this gap.

In terms of software, it is important to have consistent and connected teaching materials and content. A complete connection and continuation from beginners to professionals can have a positive impact."

We can all see Japan's progress in the past decade. Coach Qiu believes that as another East Asian country, if Japan can do it, then Taiwan can do even better. At the opening ceremony of the 10th Chang Yao Cup, Qiu Guo-da was awarded the "Best Contribution Award" by Chairman Xie Jianguo.

At the 10th Chang Yao Cup, Chairman Xie Jianguo presented the "Best Contribution Award" to Coach Qiu, who shared, "I am very grateful for the Chang Yao Cup and Chairman Xie's award. I am surprised and delighted. There are definitely more people in Taiwan who are committed to grassroots sports and education, not just me."

At the ceremony, nearly 30 young players came to thank and support Coach Qiu. (Photo credit: Chang Yao Cup) "Quietly cultivating grassroots is a spirit. As long as we are willing to persevere and work hard, we will eventually be seen by more people and even spread and inspire more people to join in grassroots nurturing."

Coach Qiu humbly expresses his gratitude and humility, stating that he is just one representative among countless others who are committed to grassroots basketball. He hopes to encourage and share with more people who are also dedicated to promoting grassroots basketball, and grow and thrive together.

Grassroots education is a never-ending journey with no clear destination, but we can feel the beauty of the scattered changes along the way.
