To everyone's surprise, Damian Lillard's final destination is the Bucks. Why didn't I consider the Bucks as a potential landing spot for Lillard? It's not just because Holiday is irreplaceable, but also because they don't have enough draft picks to trade for Lillard.

Just using Holiday and a first-round pick, plus two pick swaps, to upgrade their point guard to a Tier-0 scoring guard in the league is definitely a steal. Although it's not all bad, Holiday puts too much effort on defense, which leads to his inconsistent offense in the playoffs. Especially since Giannis mentioned wanting to strengthen the team, and Holiday has previously said he will retire after his contract ends, it's understandable why the Bucks would target him.

But the more important thing is that the Bucks have never had a need for a ball-dominant scoring guard since Giannis joined the team. Lopez, Giannis, and even Middleton don't need much ball-handling, especially with MVP Giannis being able to play off-ball and make cuts.

Although Lillard won't be able to play the same way he did with the Trail Blazers, constantly having the ball in his hands and carrying the team, he should be able to adapt to being a pick-and-roll ball handler and reduce his isolation play. Your pick-and-roll partner is now upgraded to Giannis, do you still need to handle the ball every possession? The question now is, how will the Bucks make up for the loss of Grayson Allen and Jrue Holiday's perimeter defense? Honestly, they don't have to.

The Bucks' problem has always been their inconsistent offense from the backcourt. As mentioned before, Holiday has his issues and Carter, Allen, and Connaughton are all defensively-minded and inconsistent on offense. It seems like the Bucks are willing to sacrifice some perimeter defense in exchange for a more stable backcourt initiator.

Especially since their defensive strength has always been in the paint, as long as the guards can navigate screens and prevent the first pass, allowing Giannis to roam and protect the rim, with Lopez cleaning up, they'll be fine.

The Bucks have lowered their opponents' field goal percentage in the paint by 2.8% this year, all thanks to their paint protectors. Although Holiday is responsible for guarding the opposing team's star player, it's uncertain if they'll be able to find someone to fill that role in the future. Middleton is getting older, Crowder, forget it. It might end up being Lillard or Connaughton, but it must be said that Lillard has shown effort on defense at the beginning of the season, and his poor defensive stats were largely due to the team's overall poor defense. But if they utilize a 3-2 zone defense, with Lillard designated as the chaser/low activity defender, he won't become a black hole on defense.

Now let's talk about the rumored trade with the Heat, who Lillard has expressed his desire to join. The Trail Blazers obviously didn't give in, and the trade package the Heat could offer wasn't attractive either, with Herro, Lowry, and Robinson being the potential players to be included, plus two first-round picks. No wonder the Trail Blazers weren't interested in negotiating with the Heat.

But sending him to the Bucks also satisfies Giannis, who has expressed his liking for Lillard. After all, during the All-Star draft this year, Giannis passed on Holiday and chose Lillard with the first pick.

Now they're basically doing the same thing...right? The Trail Blazers managed to get a lot of assets for Lillard, including a first-round pick, two pick swaps, this year's All-Star Holiday, and number one overall pick Ayton. It seems like a lot on paper.

Especially since Holiday only has a 1+1 contract, making $36 million won't be too difficult, and his trade value is still high. The Trail Blazers should act as arms dealers, taking advantage of other teams' desire to strengthen their team after the Bucks' trade and exchange for more assets.

For example, we can first sell Lillard to the Bucks and then tell everyone, "The Eastern Conference is dangerous, do any of you need Jrue Holiday to guard Lillard?" and then cheat them out of their assets.

As long as the team acquiring Holiday can offer expiring contracts and enough first-round picks, I believe the Trail Blazers will consider it.

Of course, the combined $90 million contract of Simons, Grant, and Ayton for at least three years is not something the Trail Blazers would consider taking on.

But if they can get a young, promising wing player in return, the Trail Blazers might consider it. As for Ayton, sigh. I personally don't like him, although his potential is higher than the already established Nurkic, Ayton's excellent interior defense is the best addition the Trail Blazers could make. Although they'll lose the threat of pick-and-pop and handoffs, if Billups plans to completely revamp their offense and defense system, reducing double teams and increasing pick-and-roll and low-post plays, the Henderson-Ayton connection could still be a threat in the future.

Lastly, there's Allen. If you really see him as your solution, the Trail Blazers wouldn't have traded him back. But if they can get a young, long-range shooting wing player in return, they might consider it.
