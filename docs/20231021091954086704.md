NTNU has initiated the "CBL University Basketball Home and Away Invitational Tournament" and has invited six teams from the northern region of Taiwan, including National Chengchi University, National Taiwan University, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, National Taiwan University of Arts, and Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology, to participate in the tournament this fall. Modeled after the NCAA home and away game system in the United States, the tournament aims to bring basketball competitions onto campuses and create a new and more cohesive sports atmosphere.

This afternoon (10/3), a press conference was held at the NTNU Golden Hall to kick off the tournament. Representatives from all six universities, team leaders, and principals attended the event, and NTNU's distinguished alumnus Wu Yong-ren was also present.

As a prelude to the annual UBA competition, NTNU President Wu Cheng-chi said, "Sports should not only be about competition, and it's not just about winning trophies and medals. In the United States, we can see that the NCAA has incorporated the home and away game system, which makes student sports an integral part of campus culture and a core that brings students and alumni together. That is the true value of sports."

Former NTNU alumnus and current coach of the National Chengchi University men's basketball team, Chen Tzu-wei, said, "The home and away game system of the NCAA is a model that Taiwan can learn from. It not only bridges the gap between current students and alumni but also allows alumni to return to their alma mater to support and pay attention to the development of sports, creating long-term benefits for the development of sports."

NTNU men's basketball coach Lee Ping-hung also responded, "Different from playing in the same arena in a league, the home and away system highlights the players' adaptability to different environments, adding more challenges to the game." He also jokingly challenged Chen Tzu-wei, "When NTNU won three consecutive championships on their home court, you were the coach. Now that you have moved on to another university and won three consecutive championships there, I look forward to competing against you on our home court and taking back the three-peat."

"It's an honor to come back as a distinguished alumnus to participate in this feast. I thank my alma mater for providing a platform for players to showcase their talents and giving them more opportunities to perform. Every opportunity is precious and important, and I encourage my juniors to cherish and enjoy the atmosphere of the home and away games," said Wu Yong-ren, emphasizing the importance of introducing successful experiences from other countries to bring new and positive energy to Taiwanese basketball and help players grow and improve.

The tournament will take place for two months from October 5th to November 30th. The Dean of the College of Sports and Recreation at NTNU, Chi Li-kang, believes that the CBL Invitational Tournament is not just a sports event, but also a starting point for creating a new force in the student basketball and sports environment in Taiwan.
