  Who will play the roles of Abassi and Li Chi-wei in the Asian Games for Chinese men's basketball team?

In the absence of Chen Yingjun, the Chinese men's basketball team made their final roster adjustments by adding Li Chi-wei and three other players. This not only provides backups for each position but also increases the team's flexibility in terms of rotation.

Li Chi-wei has shown his skills during the Jones Cup, being a sharpshooter with accurate outside shots, providing another scoring option for the team. On the other hand, Abassi was previously designated as the sixth man, known for his aggressive play off the bench. How will these two players contribute to the team during the Asian Games? Let's take a closer look.

Abassi, originally from Senegal, officially became a local player this year and was immediately called up to the national team. He has performed exceptionally well in the past two professional seasons, earning numerous individual awards and gaining recognition from his peers. He is expected to bring a strong offensive presence to the Chinese team.

During the Jones Cup, Abassi fearlessly faced tougher opponents and recorded double-digit points in all four games. He also has a knack for steals and uses his athleticism to score in transition. In the game against Japan, he scored 31 points and had a plus-minus rating of 21, which was his best performance of the tournament.

Abassi's excellent off-ball movement is a result of his professional training. His quickness and high release point allow him to shoot efficiently after receiving the ball. He also possesses explosive first-step speed, which compensates for his lack of finesse in his ball-handling skills. Against tougher opponents, he will be a key scorer for the team.

However, despite his impressive numbers and contributions to the team, Abassi still needs more opportunities to score due to his inconsistent shooting. This will be a challenge for him on the offensive end.

Aside from scoring, Abassi is also a capable playmaker and does not hesitate to share the ball. He is also keen on observing his teammates' movements while attacking, and his ability to stay in the air allows him to find open teammates for passes. With Chen Yingjun out, he may also help with ball-handling duties and relieve some pressure for the team.

The Chinese team lacks players who can penetrate and score, making Abassi an essential player in the years to come. His ability to attack the rim will be crucial against tougher opponents and will make him one of the key scorers apart from the CBA trio and naturalized player, Andray Blatche.

Li Chi-wei has earned the reputation of being a "sharpshooter" since joining the professional league. His height of 192cm gives him a high release point, and he has a consistent and balanced shooting form. He has been a key scorer for both his SBL and T1 teams and has never been called up to the national team until now. This is a perfect opportunity for him to prove himself.

During the Jones Cup, Li played in all games except for one against the United States where he did not attempt a shot. In the other games, he averaged 4.5 three-point attempts and made an average of 2 shots, which is a consistent performance for a guard. Even though his scoring numbers may not be as high as the other starters, his ability to stretch the floor and create space for his teammates is valuable. With players like Andray Blatche, Liu Zheng, and Lin Tingqian in the frontcourt, Li's shooting will provide more opportunities for them to attack the basket. 

Li's positioning becomes even more critical when he is paired with Liu Zheng in pick-and-rolls. As a late addition to the starting lineup, he prevents opponents from easily double-teaming or shrinking their defense, making him the perfect fit for the starting shooting guard/small forward position. However, his main weakness is his lack of impact on the game outside of scoring. His defense is also a weakness, especially against stronger power forwards. He can only contribute as a "sharpshooter" and cannot be a reliable 3-and-D player.

But with other players who have more skills on the court, Li's job is to hit his shots. Even with limited playing time of around 20 minutes per game, he can still make a significant contribution. In my opinion, Li is the best addition to the team, even though he may have some defensive shortcomings. His height will help improve the team's overall height and make up for their weaknesses in defense and rebounding. He is also a player with a great attitude, always giving his best on the court regardless of the score. From being a bench player to now a starter, his professionalism and dedication deserve a spot on the team.

Abassi and Li Chi-wei are both the best supporting players for the Chinese men's basketball team in the Asian Games. From the initial 18-man roster to the current 12, the CBA trio and naturalized player Andray Blatche are the core of the team. Finding suitable players from the domestic league to support them is crucial, especially in terms of offensive firepower. Otherwise, the starters may tire out early in the game, causing them to lose their competitiveness in the crucial moments. Abassi will undoubtedly be the go-to player for offense apart from the core players, while Li's outside shooting can provide the necessary spacing for the team. They will both be the key to the team's success as the sixth men.
