  Steve Kerr discusses starting lineup options for the upcoming NBA season, emphasizing the need for each player to accept their role.

As the NBA season approaches, the Warriors' lineup configuration has become a topic of discussion. Today, head coach Steve Kerr was asked about the starting five for the beginning of the season. He mentioned that the team has six potential starters and will continue to test different combinations. If a particular lineup proves effective, each player must accept their role. Kerr stated, "From my perspective, we essentially have six players capable of starting, but only five can be in the starting lineup. I haven't made a decision yet on who will start. We will evaluate based on practice and preseason games, trying out different combinations."

"It's clear that all six of these players are talented and can contribute significantly. If we find a starting five that works well, each individual must embrace their role, whether as a starter or coming off the bench. Only with the whole team fully committed can we have a chance at success," Kerr added. "These players are all exceptional, and I understand them. They are competitive and have a strong desire to win."

The six players Kerr referred to are undoubtedly Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, and Kevon Looney. In the past, Chris Paul has been a regular starter for the Warriors over the past two years. This lineup led the Warriors to win the 2021-22 NBA championship.

The question now is whether Chris Paul's playing style will be effectively showcased within the Warriors' roster. This will be one of the focal points during training camp and preseason games.
