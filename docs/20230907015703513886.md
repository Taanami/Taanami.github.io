 Jeremy Lin Confirmed to Join PLG Kaohsiung Steel in Taiwan, Supports the Great Southern Project to Address the Imbalance in Taiwan's Basketball Scene

PLG Kaohsiung Steel, a team in the P. LEAGUE+ basketball league, announced today that Taiwanese-American former NBA star Jeremy Lin will be joining their team. Lin, who is currently in the United States, posted a photoshopped image of himself wearing the number 7 jersey on social media and wrote, "Kaohsiung, I'm coming."

Rumors of Lin joining the Taiwanese professional basketball league have been circulating since the end of last year, but the team had not confirmed it until now. The announcement by PLG Kaohsiung Steel on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year has once again shaken up Taiwan's basketball scene. The 2022-23 season of the Taiwanese professional basketball league has been full of surprises. The Taoyuan Yungshin Leopards of the Taiwan e-Sports Basketball League recently signed Dwight Howard, an NBA All-Star who has been selected eight times, and now PLG has recruited Jeremy Lin, who is highly popular in Taiwan. This sets the stage for a showdown between the two basketball stars.

News of Lin's return to Taiwan to play basketball has been brewing since last year. However, at that time, he was still playing for the Guangzhou Long Lions in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). It wasn't until the end of last year when he announced his departure from the CBA that his return to Taiwan gained attention again. Lin's younger brother, Lin Shu-Wei, currently plays for the New Taipei City Kings, a team in the PLG league. Lin Shu-Wei previously expressed his hope of playing alongside his brother during their professional careers. Although they won't be playing on the same team, they will soon have the opportunity to face each other in the same league, taking a big step towards their "reunion." In addition to posting a photo of himself wearing the Steel jersey on social media, Jeremy Lin wrote, "Kaohsiung, I'm coming." Many fans expressed their support online, with one fan writing, "Welcome to Kaohsiung! Kaohsiung people will support you till the end." Another fan wrote, "Taiwan welcomes you back to play basketball," showing their joy and support for Lin's return to Taiwan.

PLG Kaohsiung Steel officially announced the recruitment of Taiwanese-American basketball star Jeremy Lin. Recognizing the long-standing imbalance between the basketball scenes in northern and southern Taiwan, Lin Lin has embraced the Steel's "Great Southern Project" and hopes to contribute to the team's success. Jeremy Lin, who sparked the "Linsanity" phenomenon in the NBA, has played in top professional leagues such as the NBA and CBA for many years. He ended his contract with the CBA early last year and decided to return to Taiwan after the Lunar New Year. Lin's NBA journey was not without obstacles. Although he signed contracts with the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets, he did not have many opportunities to play. He went back and forth between the NBA and the development league until he joined the New York Knicks in 2012. During a game, he scored a career-high of 25 points, along with 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals, leading the team to victory and attracting attention from fans. In subsequent games, Lin continued to deliver impressive performances, scoring double-doubles against star guards like John Wall and a career-high of 38 points against the late Kobe Bryant. The "Linsanity" phenomenon became a hot topic in the global basketball community and Lin appeared on the cover of Time magazine and was named one of the TIME 100 most influential people in 2012.

After nearly ten years of playing in the NBA, Lin won an NBA championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019 and then decided to join the CBA, signing with the Beijing Ducks. He averaged 22.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. Wherever Lin went, whether it was a home or away game, the arenas were always packed with fans cheering for him. Ending his contract early last year, he joined the Kaohsiung Steel after the Lunar New Year this year. The Kaohsiung Steel team stated in a press release that the "Linsanity" phenomenon was not a coincidence. Besides Lin's high level of self-discipline and determination, he never gave up and was always ready for opportunities. During the Knicks' losing streak, Lin seized the chance and led the team to overcome adversity, achieving a winning streak and entering the playoffs, proving himself with his performance. This situation is similar to the current state of the Kaohsiung Steel team.

With Jeremy Lin joining the Steel, he is expected to become the team's new offensive leader, filling the gap in experience in the team's backcourt. In addition to providing substantial support to the team, Lin's presence will also benefit rising star point guard Chen Yu-Wei and versatile guard Wang Lu-Xiang, who are being nurtured by the team.

As the only team in southern Taiwan in the P. LEAGUE+ league, the Kaohsiung Steel joined the league last year and has been actively promoting the "Great Southern Project" to address the long-standing resource imbalance in Taiwan's basketball scene between the north and the south. The addition of Jeremy Lin and his support will further advance the Steel's "Great Southern Project."

Jeremy Lin, a devout Christian, has had a long-standing connection with the Fengshan Gymnasium in Kaohsiung, the home stadium of the Steel. In 2016, he shared his life experiences and faith with nearly 5,000 churchgoers and fans in a testimony titled "Unceasing Breakthroughs in Life." After becoming an NBA player, Lin faced many challenges and discrimination, but he adjusted his pace and bravely confronted the obstacles.

According to the team's general manager, Gao Jingyan, Lin's sense of responsibility and mission for both himself and the overall development of basketball played a key role in his decision to join. He recognized that basketball development in Taiwan has been concentrated in the north, while the south has been relatively less vibrant. He hopes that his joining the team can change the viewing habits of basketball fans in southern Taiwan and bring more resources and change to the southern market. Lin's basketball career has always been about challenging the impossible. Despite being undrafted in the NBA draft and facing skepticism due to his Asian heritage, he successfully entered the NBA and established his value and market. Now, by joining the Kaohsiung Steel, fans are hoping that he can replicate the success of "Linsanity" and become the team's savior.
