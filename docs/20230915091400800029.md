Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban recently appeared on Patrick Beverley's show, "Pat Bev Pod," where he discussed player misconduct issues. Cuban revealed that he had traded players in the past due to excessive drug use.

Beverley asked, "What if a player can average 17 points per game, but has some bad habits? Maybe they're into partying or gambling. Everyone has their vices. As a team owner, would this affect the contract you offer to a player?" Cuban responded, "Yes, 100%, because it's a team. I'm not lying, I have traded players because they were using too much."

"Every team has its own culture. If you have young players who are still learning the game, they might occasionally indulge, but they don't understand the team culture or the NBA culture. And then you have this one guy who, when you walk through the hotel corridor, you know which floor he's on, and suddenly other young players start picking up this bad habit. You see how they look when they come out of their rooms, and you see their eyes get a little red when they go to practice. You don't want them to go down that path," Cuban explained.

"Using is one thing, but the intensity and frequency of what you're using is another. If you cross that line, then you have to consider the bigger picture, and it doesn't align with our team culture," Cuban concluded.
