 202324 Season Analysis: The Fine Line Between Burial and Rebirth for the Philadelphia 76ers

Introduction

This is now the third coach we have had in the Joel Embiid era. While Embiid has shown improvement, we always seem to be missing something when it matters most. But there is no room for fans to catch their breath, as the drama between Raptors coach Nick Nurse coming to Philly and the James Harden and Morey soap opera continues even into training camp. Keep reading to find out what we can expect and how much longer we can wait for Embiid to become a true superstar.

Key Players for This Season

Who knows what the James Harden trade could bring? While Harden may have gotten his wish to be traded, the situation is now out of his control and he may have burned bridges in the process.

For the Sixers, it's clear they need to trade for space and time. Finding a team willing to use their bird rights to re-sign a rental player for only half a season is extremely difficult. On the other hand, for a team looking to contend for a championship, a half-season rental may be more appealing.

Harden may be frustrated, but he's not the one in control of the trade. He can only watch as his precious time slowly ticks away.

But what fans are more concerned about is if the Sixers can find a suitable trade destination before the deadline to avoid losing out on Harden's salary and the potential benefits it brings.

Conclusion

In terms of Morey's plans, he's walking on a tightrope and could easily set himself on fire. But if he can also manage to handle Harris' expiring contract, there's a chance for the Sixers to make another push during Embiid's prime. Whether or not they can find a suitable wing player in return remains to be seen, but the window for a championship this year is definitely smaller than last year's.
