The PLG Dreamers announced today (18) that they will gather two league teams to hold the "Dream Link" exchange tournament. They have invited the PLG Taipei Fubon Braves, Taoyuan Puda Flight Monkeys, T1 New Taipei CTBC Brothers, and Kaohsiung FamilyMart Marlins. The five teams will come together on October 21 and 22 at the Dreamers' home court in Taichung, the Intercontinental Mini Egg, to begin the tournament. The Dreamers team stated that the purpose of this exchange tournament is to build connections with different league teams. This will not only allow players to gain experience through the competition and adapt to changes on the court, but also stimulate different sparks through a variety of match-ups, enhancing the game's excitement. The Dreamers also expressed their gratitude to the participating teams and hope to have more teams join in the future to enrich and deepen the exchange between teams, and for fans to witness more exciting games.

The game will consist of four quarters of 12 minutes each, with a maximum of three foreign players registered on the roster. The game will follow a 4x8 format, and if a player accumulates 6 personal fouls, they will be disqualified from the game. Each team can call one 30-second timeout in the final 2 minutes of the deciding quarter (fourth quarter or overtime). Other than the aforementioned adjustments, the rest of the competition rules will be based on the latest FIBA regulations.

The "Dream Link" exchange tournament will kick off this weekend, October 21 and 22, at the Dreamers' home court in Taichung. Tickets will be available for purchase on the ibon ticketing system, and the game will be broadcasted on MOMOTV's 75th channel.
