  PLG accuses Taishin of lacking sincerity in negotiation, formally files a lawsuit against Hsinchu Leopards

Hsinchu Leopards basketball team respects the outcome of the first mediation meeting held by the Chinese Basketball Association on (date), and looks forward to Taishin team proposing negotiation conditions.

However, today Hsinchu Leopards received a response from Taishin team rejecting the negotiation and choosing to hide behind the players to evade responsibility, which clearly violates the conclusion of the meeting. Therefore, Hsinchu Leopards officially filed a lawsuit this afternoon. Taishin team has stated that they refuse to negotiate with Hsinchu Leopards as a team and only agree to deal with the contract dispute through Lin Bing-Sheng alone.

Hsinchu Leopards believe that this action does not comply with the consensus reached by all parties at the first mediation meeting, and Lin Bing-Sheng's unjustified absence from the meeting indicates Taishin team's inconsistent attitude and lack of sincerity in negotiation. Therefore, this afternoon, accompanied by the appointed legal team, Hsinchu Leopards' co-founder Hu Lung-Chih and board representative Lin Hsien-Er filed a civil lawsuit against Lin Bing-Sheng at the Taipei District Court, seeking substantial damages for the losses suffered by the team. As for Taishin team, Hsinchu Leopards holds them jointly liable based on the principle of joint tortious liability in the Civil Code and violation of Article 25 of the Fair Trade Act, and will also file a complaint with the Fair Trade Commission regarding Taishin team's actions.
