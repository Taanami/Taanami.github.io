The Memphis Grizzlies, despite being in a small market, have repeatedly surprised skeptics in recent years by giving powerhouse teams a run for their money in the playoffs.

Their aggressive playing style and never-give-up spirit have made fans ecstatic. However, little-known is the secret behind the Grizzlies' home court internet and communication equipment.

The tale of misery and resilience of the Memphis Grizzlies began in 1995 when the team was established in Vancouver, Canada.

Compared to the Toronto Raptors, who also entered the league from Canada around the same time, the Grizzlies were considered soft and struggled with their dismal performance. The combination of poor records and being located on the fringes led the management to relocate the team to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001.

During their six seasons in Vancouver, the Grizzlies achieved a woeful record of 101 wins and 359 losses, with a winning percentage of only 22%. Please continue reading below. 

In their first year after the move, the team underwent a transformation. They not only relocated to the warm and pleasant South but also acquired Spanish power forward Pau Gasol as the 3rd overall pick in the draft.

Gasol, who was selected as the Rookie of the Year with averages of 17.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 2.7 assists, undoubtedly became the cornerstone of the Grizzlies. Despite Gasol's impressive performance, the team struggled in the playoffs, facing tough opponents such as the Spurs, Suns, and Mavericks in consecutive years. The inexperienced Grizzlies failed to secure a single victory in the playoffs, ending with a record of 0 wins and 12 losses. The team found themselves in a predicament of being unable to progress further, compounded by Gasol's injuries. As a result, Gasol was traded to the Lakers in the middle of the 2008 season for a rebuilding effort, and his younger brother Marc Gasol was included in the trade. When Marc arrived at the team as a second-round rookie before the 08-09 season, he was relatively unknown. However, no one expected him to join forces with young point guard Mike Conley, who was selected the previous year, as well as the disgruntled forward Zach Randolph, to transform the Grizzlies into a force to be reckoned with in the Western Conference.

Since creating the "Legend of the 8th Seed" by defeating the top-seeded Spurs in 2011, the Grizzlies have become a formidable obstacle in the Western Conference. They have made the playoffs for seven consecutive years, although they have never advanced to the Western Conference Finals. However, teams such as the Spurs, Warriors, and Thunder, who are regular participants in the conference finals, often have to overcome the hurdle of the Grizzlies. Just like the blue-collar atmosphere of Memphis, the Grizzlies' playing style has remained consistently aggressive, resilient, and tenacious.

Despite being in a small market, the Grizzlies' tough and caring image has strengthened the bond between the team and local fans, especially with key players Conley and Randolph being fan favorites.

Both players are actively involved in community service and have been recognized with the NBA Cares Community Assist Award (Conley has even won it twice). With such close interaction between the team's core players and local residents, it is not difficult to imagine the Grizzlies' position in Memphis.

As the only major professional sports team in Memphis, the franchise is dedicated to community engagement. In addition to actively participating in local education, youth development, health, and fitness initiatives, the team is committed to enhancing the fan experience.

Since current owner Robert Pera acquired the team in 2012, his parent company Ubiquiti Inc. has provided technical assistance to ensure that fans can enjoy uninterrupted internet access while watching games.

However, accessing the internet inside enclosed arenas is not as straightforward as one might think. The size and design of the venue can cause signal interference, and the crowded audience absorbs a significant amount of radio frequency, making signal transmission difficult. In addition, the rapid movement of crowds during popular events poses a challenge for arenas to meet all the networking needs, from near emptiness to a packed house.

This phenomenon is commonly observed at most indoor sports events, concerts, and large-scale music performances.

The aforementioned challenges have also occurred at the Grizzlies' home court, FedEx Forum. However, after multiple equipment iterations, Ubiquiti Inc.'s Wi-Fi equipment, UniFi Wireless BaseStation - XG (UWB-XG), has successfully showcased its excellent technology to the world.
