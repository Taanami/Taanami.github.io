# NBA contract is coming to an end 
 NBA contract is coming to an end. Would Curry consider continuing his career?

Stephen Curry was interviewed and discussed his future plans. Curry stated that he intends to focus on completing his current contract and will consider his options after it expires. When asked if he wants to have a career longevity like LeBron James, Curry replied, "Probably within that range, but I never thought I would be a person in my 40s, working hard for my life."

"But who knows what my body will be like at that moment? Starting from this year, I still have three years left on my contract, so at least that long, and then I will make plans. "I haven't thought about it too much yet, except for finishing my contract, which would bring me to 37 or 38 years old, playing in the league for about 17 years? Damn, give me that long, I haven't even had much time to play golf."

That's what Curry said.
