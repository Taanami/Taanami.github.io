  SBL2023 Rookie Draft: Foreign Player Su Geer Becomes the First Pick, Jiang Haowen Second, Guo Zhenfu Third

The SBL league held its rookie draft today, and Changhua Bank selected foreign player Su Geer as the first pick. Taiwan Beer chose Jiang Haowen as the second pick, while Taiwan Cooperative Bank selected Guo Zhenfu as the third pick. The fourth pick went to Yulon Luxgen Dinos, who chose Wang Yifan.

Foreign player Su Geer hails from Mongolia and has played for three schools in the UBA league. During his time at Zhongzhou University of Science and Technology, he led the team to the final four and secured third place by defeating Fu Jen Catholic University. He studied at the ChinaTrust Financial Management College last year and won the championship in the UBA second division.

He also became the first foreign player in SBL history to be drafted as the first pick. Taiwan Beer selected Jiang Haowen as the second pick. He attended Gao Yuan Vocational and Commercial High School and later studied at National Taiwan Normal University. He primarily plays as a point guard and stands at 175 cm tall. In college, he averaged 8 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 1.9 assists per game.

Guo Zhenfu was chosen as the third pick by Taiwan Cooperative Bank. He attended Yilan High School and later studied at National Kaohsiung Normal University. He specializes in playing as a forward and stands at 190 cm tall. In college, he averaged 13.1 points and 6.8 rebounds per game.

Previously, he was selected by Taichung Sun in the second round of the T1 draft, so his future moves are also worth noting. Yulon Luxgen Dinos selected Wang Yifan as the fourth pick. He attended Neng Ren Vocational High School and later studied at Fu Jen Catholic University. He primarily plays as a point guard and stands at 173 cm tall. In college, he averaged 7.5 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game.

Both Wang Yifan and Guo Zhenfu were previously selected in the professional league (PLG draft) by Hsinchu JX-Eneos Sun in the second round, so their future choices are also worth watching.
