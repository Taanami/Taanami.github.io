 NBA player Skal Labissiere has signed a partially guaranteed one-year contract with the Sacramento Kings, according to reporter Shams Charania. Labissiere was originally drafted by the Kings but was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers after less than three seasons with the team. He last played in the NBA in 2019 and has spent over three years away from the league, including stints in the G-League, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. It is expected that Labissiere will spend most of his time in the G-League while the Kings evaluate his performance and potentially promote him to the main roster. Labissiere was selected by the Kings as the 28th overall pick in the first round of the 2016 NBA Draft. He averaged 8.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per game in his rookie season and had similar numbers the following year. However, his playing time decreased significantly after being traded to the Trail Blazers in the 2018-2019 season. He was later traded to the Atlanta Hawks for salary cap space and signed a ten-day contract with the New York Knicks, but was released without playing a game.
