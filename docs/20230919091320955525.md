Zhiping High School has been participating in the Firefighters' Cup since 2021, and they ended their journey in the North District preliminary round. After experiencing the cancellation of the tournament in 2022 due to the pandemic, they once again challenged themselves and emerged as the champions in both the North District and the national finals for the single-school division this year. Facing tough opponents from all directions, Zhiping High School overcame all obstacles. During the journey to the final in the south, the team even encountered difficulties and experienced a setback in the first two days. However, they successfully adjusted on the third day and found their own rhythm. In the championship game against Kaohsiung Vocational High School, they achieved sweet revenge and brought the national title back to the North District for the first time since 2018.

Zhiping High School already had a Class A basketball team, but due to the system, they were unable to form a team consisting of regular students to participate in the Class B league. Nevertheless, these basketball enthusiasts continue to work hard for their passion. The team was established about 5 years ago, with seven first-year students forming the core of the team this year, along with five second-year seniors. Many of them are participating in the Firefighters' Cup for the first time. However, because it was their first time, they also experienced a completely different style of play and atmosphere.

When asked about the most memorable games in the North District preliminary round and the national finals, 16-year-old Yu Mengxun said, "In the preliminary round, we would have secured a spot in the top four with a victory, but our own mistakes led to a loss. However, in the finals, we had another chance to face Xiongong. In this game, we improved on our previous shortcomings, and our three-point shooting percentage also increased. The key was the coach's change in defensive tactics. Only after adjusting on both ends of the court were we able to achieve victory and successfully avenge our previous defeat."

However, Zhiping High School encountered some challenges when they traveled south. The players mentioned that they were too relaxed in the first two games of the national tournament, which made the first victory difficult. In the second game, they made too many mistakes and couldn't make the necessary adjustments in time, resulting in a loss. From the third game onwards, they gradually improved and became more aggressive in their defense. In the semifinals, they reached their expected performance level. Even after the games, they would discuss the issues that arose during the matches and how to make improvements. With everyone offering advice to each other and making timely adjustments, coupled with their growing cohesion, they were able to ultimately claim the championship.

In addition, Chen Liyu, who won the Finals Most Valuable Player (FMVP) award, made a strong impression. He stepped up in the championship game and provided offensive firepower for the team. Yu Mengxun, after winning the FMVP award in the preliminary round, also received the Assist Leader award in the finals, while Zhang Enqi won the Steal Leader award. These three players played crucial roles and their chemistry contributed to Zhiping High School's success in winning the championship.

Coach Huang Defeng, who led the team to victory, also received the Best Coach award from the tournament organizers. When asked about his journey this year, he expressed his gratitude for the Firefighters' Cup for providing such a great stage for the young athletes to showcase their talents and prove themselves. He admitted that they did not expect to win the championship this year, as compared to last year, the team was not in as good physical condition and lacked experience. However, the trust, unity, and never-give-up spirit among the players touched and made him and Coach Wu Zhengxian proud. He hopes that they can pass on this energy to the younger students and wishes for their continuous improvement.

Finally, Zhiping High School expresses their gratitude to the Firefighters' Cup for providing this platform for their players to be seen. They also want to specially thank the school's chairman and the parents for taking special care of the student-athletes, allowing them to focus on training without any worries, and pursue their passion. They look forward to defending their title and achieving a consecutive championship next year.
