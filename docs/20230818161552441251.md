LeBron James, the star player of the Los Angeles Lakers, achieved his "unbelievable" accomplishment of becoming the NBA's all-time leading scorer. He stated after the game that he doesn't feel like retiring yet and expects his career to continue for at least another 2 years. According to Agence France-Presse, the 38-year-old James scored 38 points in the Lakers' game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, pushing his total NBA career points to 38,390, surpassing Jabbar's record of 38,387 points set in 1984.

The only unknown now is how much James' total points record will increase when he eventually ends his NBA career.

James stated in an interview with Turner Sports, "I know I can still play for a few more years. Based on how I feel and how my body has responded during this season." He said, "I know I can still play for a few more years, it just depends on my mindset. If my mindset remains focused, if I still have the motivation to pursue championships, I feel like I can continue playing." He added, "If my mind is clear and I feel motivated every day to prepare myself, then I can continue to compete." However, James admitted that he is still digesting the fact that he has finally surpassed Jabbar's long-standing scoring record. He said, "It's surreal because I never saw this as a personal goal or something I was preparing to accomplish, so I'm simply happy."

Regarding his record-breaking achievement, James attributed it to "maintaining long-term health, being able to play for three different teams, striving for the best performance every night, having great teammates, and having coaches who allow me to play my game." "To be able to play at this level for 20 years, to be at the peak of my game, it feels unreal." He said, "I hope I can keep it going, but in the end, I feel honored to have been in the league for 20 years."

LeBron James achieved his milestone of becoming the NBA's all-time leading scorer yesterday in the Los Angeles Lakers' home game. Despite ultimately losing the game, James, who is in his 20th year of his career, not only leads a disciplined life but also spends over 1.5 million dollars annually on his physical well-being. For NBA players known for their active nightlife, LeBron James seems to be an "exception." Since joining the NBA, there has been no news of him being involved in any scandals or incidents related to nightlife. He spends over 1.5 million dollars (approximately 45 million New Taiwan dollars) annually on his own physical maintenance.
