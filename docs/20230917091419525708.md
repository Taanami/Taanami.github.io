#  The Weakest U 
  The Weakest U.S. Team in Chit-Chat History before the Bronze Medal Match

Introduction
Since the formation of the U.S. team for this World Cup, it has been labeled as the "weakest U.S. team in history" due to the absence of big-name players. From the bumpy start of the tournament to the first defeat in the second round, and finally missing out on the gold medal match, it seems to have validated this "weakest" label... Unfair Evaluation I must honestly say that it is extremely unfair to label any national team as the "weakest in history" for players who sacrifice their rest time to bring glory to their country. Take the U.S. men's basketball team in this World Cup as an example. It is undeniable that their members have relatively shallow experience, with the most notable achievement in the NBA being selected for the All-Star Game (okay, I know JJJ is the Defensive Player of the Year). Compared to players in the past who have won MVP or made it to the All-NBA teams, they do fall short in terms of star power, so it is understandable that they are not highly regarded by the outside world. However, they represent the dominant force in world basketball, the U.S. team, so they are burdened with excessive expectations... On one hand, people think they are weak, but on the other hand, they believe they should perform well; on one hand, they think they are weak, but they describe their losses as "upsets." Doesn't this logic seem contradictory? This not only unfair to the U.S. team but also unfair to the teams that defeated them! The most important thing is, how do we define the "weakest in history"? Is it based on the players' experience? The number of defeats? Or their ranking? If it is based on player experience, would the outside world change their tune to "heroes emerge from the younger generation" if the U.S. team wins the gold medal today? In fact, during the 2010 World Championship and the 2014 World Cup, the U.S. team was also initially questioned for lacking star power. However, as the saying goes, winning cures all, and after winning the gold medal with a perfect record, the doubts turned into admiration... Source: Wikipedia, Free Sports If it is based on the number of defeats, the current U.S. team has lost two games (one in the second round and one in the knockout stage) without playing the bronze medal match. Here are a few numbers for everyone to consider: In the 2019 World Cup, the U.S. team lost two games (one in the knockout stage and one in the classification round); in the 2004 Olympics, they lost three games (two in the group stage and one in the knockout stage); in the 2002 World Championship, they lost three games (one in the second round, one in the knockout stage, and one in the classification round). If it is based on ranking, the best result for the U.S. team this time would be third place, the same as in the 2004 Olympics and the 2006 World Championship. Even if they unfortunately finish fourth, their performance would still be better than the sixth place in the 2002 World Championship and the seventh place in the 2019 World Cup. Therefore, I believe that the "weakest U.S. team in history" is nothing more than a sensational headline, lacking a strong argumentative basis. The Reality The United States is still the strongest basketball country in terms of strength, with the strongest professional basketball league and the most abundant pool of basketball talent. Setting aside player participation issues, theoretically, it would not be difficult to form three teams of equivalent strength to this representative team. However, international competitions emphasize teamwork, while most other national teams have been playing together since their youth teams, the U.S. team is different. Although the USA Basketball has been conducting national team training since the painful loss in the 2004 Olympics, the training and cohesion time is not as long as other countries. Not to mention the various factors such as players' unfamiliarity with FIBA rules and their adaptation to the referees' interpretations, which have led to the current U.S. team still being a strong team but no longer invincible. To dominate international basketball, in addition to strength, they may need a bit of luck. Future Expectations The day when people no longer think that the U.S. team's victory is a given and the U.S. team's defeat is no longer a news headline will be the true moment of equality in international basketball! As for the title that the media occasionally still uses to refer to the U.S. team: Dream Team, it is already outdated. Let it forever remain in the dream of 1992!
