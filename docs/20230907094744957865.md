 Article: Yesterday, Bronny James, the eldest son of LeBron James, collapsed during practice and experienced a momentary cardiac arrest. Fortunately, he was promptly taken to the hospital and is now out of intensive care.

However, this incident may jeopardize his efforts thus far. As the son of LeBron, Bronny has always faced more attention and pressure compared to other "baller offspring." Being the "Heir to the Throne," his basketball talent is naturally scrutinized under a larger microscope. However, compared to his father's dominance during high school, Bronny's skills are not as impressive. Although he possesses good natural abilities, he has not displayed the same level of dominance as his father did in high school. At one point, he was even considered a "product of his father." Despite facing criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continuously improved his skills. In his senior season, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, earning him a spot in the McDonald's All-American team and the title of a five-star high school player by some basketball media outlets. He also received basketball scholarships from some top NCAA Division I schools.

These achievements significantly boosted Bronny's draft projection, transforming him from a potential undrafted player to someone with a chance to be a first-round or even lottery pick.

Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father's reputation. LeBron himself has hinted that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, there is a high chance he would join his son's team and play together. This "father follows son" scenario undoubtedly impacts Bronny's stock, but it should not overshadow his own efforts. He ultimately chose the University of Southern California and plans to enter the draft after completing his freshman season. Before enrolling, he posted on his social media, expressing his determination to prove the doubters wrong.

However, the heart issue that arose before the start of the new college season casts a shadow over his future. Just like Bronny, this situation reminds me of another "baller offspring," Shareef O'Neal, the son of basketball star Shaquille O'Neal.

During high school, Shareef achieved notable success and was regarded as a four-star high school player by sports media. He also planned to enter the NBA after completing his freshman season. However, his heart abnormality was discovered during his freshman year, and there was a high probability of it posing a life-threatening risk, requiring immediate surgery. Shareef had to rest and rehabilitate for a whole 11 months, which was detrimental to his growth as an emerging player.

Losing a year during the crucial development period can result in a significant gap in skills and competitiveness. With Shareef's condition, playing in the more intense NCAA was already challenging. Coaches, concerned about the risk of the condition recurring and considering the team's performance, did not give Shareef much playing time. As a result, his college performance declined drastically, and he ultimately faced the fate of going undrafted.

"I always tell Shareef that he will never be the next me. I want him to play his own game, his own style," said Shaquille. "Unfortunately, he has to carry the O'Neal name, but he still needs to create his own path." Shareef is currently waiting for an opportunity in the developmental league. Despite averaging only 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the previous season, overcoming the shadow of his heart condition is a significant progress. Shaquille encourages his son not to be defined by his father's achievements and fame and to bravely pursue his chosen path.

LeBron likely shares a similar perspective on Bronny, as his love for his child remains unwavering regardless of his draft position. He also hopes that Bronny can overcome any injury setbacks and showcase his worth in the upcoming season. This article, authorized by the author, was originally published here.
