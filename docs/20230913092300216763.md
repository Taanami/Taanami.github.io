  PLG Lions respond to Taishin's continued lies and promise to provide evidence

Regarding Taishin's recent press conference, the PLG Lions would like to reiterate four key points. Here is the statement:

1. The PLG Lions have always respected the regulations of the former team during the contract negotiations with Lin Ping-Sung.

   When the representatives of the PLG Lions were discussing and signing the contract with Lin Ping-Sung, they added a note in Article 3, Clause 5 of the contract, stating that "if the original team matches the offer within one month after the signing of this contract, the contract will not take effect."

   This was done to protect the original team's right of first refusal. Furthermore, under the free competition of the two leagues, there are no clauses in the T1 League regarding contact with free agents. Therefore, how could the PLG Lions be accused of maliciously poaching players? Moreover, the original team has not issued any statement accusing the PLG Lions of such actions. Taishin, on the other hand, is twisting the truth by accusing the PLG Lions of maliciously poaching players. We believe that the fans and Taiwanese society can judge for themselves.

2. Lin Ping-Sung's signing was done entirely of his own free will. When Lin Ping-Sung personally signed the contract, he was accompanied by his friends and family at a Starbucks in Beitou. There were also many customers and staff present.

   How could an adult, signing a contract in broad daylight with friends and family present, not take responsibility for his own signature? And where does the claim of Lin Jui-Chiang, the head coach, attempting to persuade him to sign come from?

3. Lin Ping-Sung continued to negotiate contract details with the PLG Lions after June 28th. In the Taishin press conference, Lin Ping-Sung falsely claimed that he had expressed his decision not to join the PLG Lions to the team representatives from June 28th to August 14th. However, in reality, he continued to privately negotiate with the PLG Lions representatives between August 8th and August 14th regarding "CBA overseas clause, personal incentive bonuses, rental assistance in Hsinchu, training expense subsidies, jersey numbers," and other matters. The screenshots provided clearly refute the lies told in the Taishin press conference.

   Taishin, in their press release, attempts to twist the truth by claiming that "Lin Ping-Sung clearly informed the PLG Lions representatives multiple times that he has no intention of joining." However, with these clear screenshots, how can they say that he had no intention of joining?

4. Taishin does not respect the consensus reached during the Chinese Basketball Association's mediation meeting. The Chinese Basketball Association released a statement after the mediation meeting on September 4th, stating, "Although there is no conclusion reached in this mediation meeting, we hope to propose negotiation conditions under the premise of mutual benefit. After both sides' representatives report the content of the mediation meeting to the headquarters, a decision will be made on whether to hold a second mediation meeting based on the subsequent situation." On September 5th, the PLG Lions received a response from the Chinese Basketball Association, in which Taishin only agreed to negotiate with Lin Ping-Sung directly. This reply violates the consensus reached between the two teams during the mediation meeting.

   Finally, the PLG Lions want to emphasize that since the lawsuit has been filed, has Lin Ping-Sung breached the contract? Is Taishin maliciously poaching players? Let the court, Fair Trade Commission, and all fans in Taiwan decide! If Taishin continues to twist the truth and openly lie, the PLG Lions will continue to provide evidence. We will also continue to use more means to defend the rights and interests of PLG Lions fans and the team. Stay tuned!
