  Possible starting lineup for NBA All-Star Team vs. Team USA in the upcoming Olympics

After the conclusion of the World Cup on Sunday, players who have the opportunity to represent Team USA in the upcoming Olympics in Paris have been voicing their desire to play for their country. The question of team strength has also been a topic of discussion, with people debating whether a fully committed Team USA, consisting of the best players, can compete against the top five players from other countries.

Earlier today, Shaquille O'Neal, known as "The Big Diesel," posted on social media, asking fans for their opinions on which team would emerge victorious in a photo featuring Team USA and the World Team. The World Team's lineup includes Luka Dončić, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokić, and Joel Embiid. On the other hand, Team USA's lineup consists of Stephen Curry, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, and Anthony Davis.

The comments section sparked a lot of discussion, with some pointing out that Team USA should focus on proving themselves against Germany before talking about assembling a team of All-Stars. Others expressed concern that having LeBron and Curry on the same team would be unfair to other countries. It's important to note that the World Team lineup mentioned is unlikely to happen in an actual international game. These discussions are more about comparing the best lineups outside of the United States and whether they are closing the gap with Team USA. It remains to be seen if the USA Basketball Association will field a stronger lineup to compete against other countries in future games.
