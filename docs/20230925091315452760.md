  Reflection on the Extension Reading Program for Ordinary People

Between various international and domestic events, the popularity of Taiwanese basketball has not waned at all this week. Just when we thought the "double contract incident" was about to cool down as it entered the judicial process, the Taiwan New Ball Club held a press conference using a "no interview" scripted approach, challenging the understanding of fans and journalists. For details, you can search for the guest Xiaotie's analysis article on the "double contract incident," which is logically clear and unbiased towards any party, so I won't go into detail about the incident.

But regarding the press conference, I was disappointed. Even though we know that the apology statement was probably prepared by the team, the behavior of the players reading from the script and stumbling over words, and only realizing that they hadn't finished reading the script after being reminded by a lawyer, indeed lacked the sincerity that the general public associates with an "apology." After the conference, they refused to answer questions from journalists, claiming it was not an open Q&A session. If they didn't plan on answering questions in the first place, they didn't need to go through the trouble of holding a press conference. The team could have simply issued a statement or filmed an apology video. As the case enters the judicial process, both sides may present "partial facts" from a position that benefits themselves. Regardless of whether it is Hsinchu or Taiwan New, the information currently released is advantageous to their own side. However, Taiwan New still does not want to face the negative public perception. Instead, they have a mentality of burying their heads in the sand and treating all negative accusations as the work of Hsinchu's "internet army." But is it really the case? Are all those who booed Lin Ping-Hsuan at the game Lions fans? Are all those criticizing this incident online writers for the Hsinchu Kominga Lions? This judgment is left for the fans and netizens to decide.

Please continue reading. As for the recent buzz about the "New League," whether it is about which boss is not aligned with whom, or the excessive spotlight on "that man," which made the paying teams feel uncomfortable, or the desire to unite and exclude/cut off a certain team, what I see is not the form in which the New League will appear, but rather the purpose of operating a professional sports business. Looking back at the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) established in 1989, it was initially started by the Hung brothers, who brought together Uni-President, Wei Chuan, and Tainan Enterprises to establish a professional baseball league. Before that, there were no professional athletes in Taiwan, and most baseball players came from existing amateur teams such as Taiwan Power, Rong-Bin, Brother, Heslink, and Chinese Petroleum. There were also many players who had played for Japanese teams and returned to Taiwan after the establishment of the CPBL. In the early stages of the league's establishment, the Hung brothers took on key roles in league operations. However, as time went on, they inevitably faced gossip and speculation, so the Hung brothers eventually ended their roles in league operations and focused on managing their teams.

Over the years, the CPBL has also experienced ups and downs. As someone who has been watching since before the first game-fixing scandal, I have personally witnessed games at the crowded Taipei Municipal Baseball Stadium and at the Tianmu Baseball Stadium with less than 1,000 people in the stands, where some fans near the outfield displayed slogans related to the game-fixing scandal. Nowadays, professional baseball in Taiwan has gradually developed its own characteristics, and each team has a stable fan base and various themed events. Over the past thirty years, these team owners have managed professional baseball teams not just to be the top team or to make a lot of money. The Hung family, who initially ran small and medium-sized businesses in trading and hospitality, required both the bosses and employees to play baseball together. Although they later sold the team to Chinatrust, they still have a lifelong passion for the sport. Liu Baoyou, the former owner of Lamigo, once said, "There's nothing I can do. I fell in love with it." This sentiment summed up the bittersweet journey of managing LaNew to Lamigo for 16 years, despite facing annual losses.

I'm not saying that professional sports teams shouldn't make money. Instead, I would like to quote a statement from a great sports commentator: this is an industry that needs dreams and sells dreams. The passion, ideals, and imagination of those involved in the industry may determine the direction and future of professional sports. When P.LEAGUE+ (P+) was successful in its first year, it was due to favorable timing, conditions, and people. Being forced to stay in Taiwan due to the pandemic and with limited entertainment options, the ABL games couldn't take place, and the two teams that were supposed to participate in the ABL became part of the P+ league. With basketball stars like the Golden Generation leading the way, targeting fans with a sense of nostalgia, this particular audience consists of people who are either settled in their careers or have been in society for a while, and they certainly have purchasing power.

The atmosphere created in the first season was not just about basketball games; it provided a blueprint for the future of professional basketball in Taiwan. It seemed to bring hope to basketball development, which had stagnated since the late stage of the SBL. But now, as the P.LEAGUE+ enters its fourth year, have we established a solid foundation? The sports industry is an industry that carries multiple dreams and requires more "fools" who are passionate about the sport. Returning to the essence of watching sports, when we see athletes giving their all for victory or to surpass themselves, as spectators, we can also feel their dedication. Why did the SBL lose its popularity while the HBL continues to thrive? Is it because high school basketball games are more entertaining? Or is it because, despite the lack of technical maturity, the spirit of never giving up until the last second has inspired us in the stands? When fans enter the arena or turn on the TV to watch a sports game, what they hope to experience is a sense of inspiration and hope. We have all been moved by a game, felt joy for a victory, or lamented a defeat. It is the players' relentless effort that not only allows us to appreciate the game but also inspires and heals us. These memories are deep and meaningful, as the band Fire Extinguisher wrote in the lyrics of their song "Once Crazy": "We will always remember you standing in front, the white frame on the red clay forever preserving your footsteps." Even if the player has left the field, our memories will be awakened every time we step into the same arena. Here, I want to tell a story that echoes the title. It is from a TV series I really like called "Designated Survivor." In one scene (if you don't want spoilers, please skip this paragraph), when the main character is accused of taking a negative term, "fool," out of context, it sparks a series of PR crises. But when he explains the meaning of the term, he says, "I believe in a lot of 'fools' in America because they believe in the 'American Dream.' Despite the difficult circumstances, they still believe in a better future and dreams that are within reach, and they work tirelessly towards it." The sports industry is the same. We need not only fans but also operators who are passionate about this professional sport. No matter how challenging the situation may be, they still believe in and love this sport. Taiwanese basketball is just getting started. Japan took 18 years from 2006 to make it to the Olympics. Although Taiwan's ranking is falling behind, it also means that we have a lot of room for improvement. Let's keep going!
