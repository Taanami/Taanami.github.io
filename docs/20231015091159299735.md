Hangzhou Asian Games, Second Game: China Men's Basketball Team 89-69 Defeats Chinese Team After the Game

Hangzhou Asian Games, Second Game: China Men's Basketball Team 89-69 Lost to China. Let's discuss what can be improved and what was done well in this game. Just like I mentioned in my previous article, three-point shots will determine the key in this game.

Today, China's three-point shooting percentage was as high as 45%, while the Chinese team's percentage was also around 35%. However, unfortunately, the opponent's three-point shooting was just too accurate, with many shots being made even with good defense.

Our own three-point shots were not taken advantage of well, which resulted in the score being pulled apart. The second issue is rebounding, as it is a well-known fact that China's team has a height advantage over the Chinese team.

So, how to protect our own rebounds is something the coaching staff needs to consider. However, in today's game, there were many rebounds that were not protected well, and there were also some unlucky situations where the ball bounced in the opposite direction and was picked up by the Chinese team.

Also, our power forwards saw opportunities for fast breaks when the opponent took a shot, which should be the team's strategy to play fast and high. But if rebounds are not grabbed, fast breaks cannot be formed.

In addition, the handling of fast breaks was not good in today's game, with hesitation and rushing at times. So, how to adjust fast breaks when facing taller opponents will also be a challenge for the Chinese team. The third issue is the lack of a pure point guard on the team. With Chen Yingjun's injury, it was very obvious today that China's team constantly pressured and marked our backcourt, making it difficult for us to pass the ball easily.

This resulted in a lack of smoothness in our offense, which is also something the Chinese team needs to think about. The fourth issue is the defensive lapses. In the third quarter, we could clearly see that China's team scored two consecutive backdoor baskets. In the fourth quarter, there were also open shots for the opponent, but our defenders did not go up to defend.

Perhaps it was due to fatigue or other factors, but this is something that needs to be improved. The fifth issue is when a player goes cold, it causes a lot of trouble for the Chinese team. This is something the coaching staff needs to think about, whether to substitute a player when they are not performing well. If not, should the focus of the offense be shifted to other players on the court? Everyone has bad days, but how to still have an impact during those times is the key for players. Today, we could see that Liu Zheng was not in good form, but he still did a lot of defensive tasks on the court, which had a huge impact.

But if we substitute in other young players, can they still provide this defensive energy when they are not in good form? This is something worth observing. Now, let's talk about the good things the Chinese team did today. First, we need to praise Hao Tianyou, who performed really well today, with a score of 20+10.

He can play one-on-one against his opponent on offense and effectively limit the opponent's attack on defense. Simply put, Hao Tianyou played basketball with his heart and soul, and we can't ask for more from him. But we need him to maintain this level of performance, and hopefully, he can continue to play like this in the upcoming games. The second person to praise is Zeng Wending, who once again played at the level of an interior player.

He shoots when he has an open shot and creates opportunities for himself and works hard on the interior. Zeng Wending does all of this perfectly, and as long as he is on the Chinese team's interior, there is still a chance to win.

The third person who did well is Abasi. But I have to say, in my opinion, Abasi's performance today was not that great, with too many turnovers and unwise passes.

(Because my expectations for him are higher, he should perform better) However, Abasi's scoring ability is something we can see, and he can still use his strong physical attributes on both offense and defense to gain an advantage. Today, Abasi scored 16 points, and I hope he can maintain this firepower and reduce turnovers, so the Chinese team can have more room for adjustments.

Lastly, we need to praise Lin Tingqian, who maintained a high level of performance despite China's team putting a lot of pressure on our backcourt. His overall performance was very stable.

But in the upcoming games, he will need to unleash his firepower, and it will depend on how the coaching staff adjusts the personnel on the court.

The three shooters in the Chinese team's backcourt, Lin Tingqian, Abasi, and Liu Zheng, need to have at least two of them firing in each game. Today, there was a situation where one and a half shooters were cold, which resulted in a lack of scoring power. I hope these three players can maintain their good form, so the pressure on the Chinese team's interior can be relieved.

Lastly, I want to say that the Chinese team's performance today was not bad. Although we lost to China, we also saw many areas for improvement, which is also a valuable experience in the Asian Games.

I hope the Chinese team can bounce back in the upcoming games and show our true strength. But we must remind ourselves not to give up just because we lost one game. We need to face the upcoming games with a positive attitude, continue to fight, and believe that the Chinese men's basketball team will have a better performance!
