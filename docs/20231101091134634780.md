The PLG Trainees Integration Team, also known as the Lion City Lions, achieved their first victory in the FIBA Intercontinental Cup in Singapore. The team, consisting of coaches, players, and foreign players, arrived in Singapore yesterday (22) to participate in the 2023 FIBA Intercontinental Cup exhibition game. In addition to showcasing their players, the Lion City Lions also brought their home court host, DJ, Muse Girls, and interactive activities to Singapore, hoping to share their experience in professional basketball management with the Singapore Sports Council and deepen cooperation and exchanges with Singapore and East Asian basketball in the future.

The Lion City Lions were recognized by the local quality construction brand "Da Yan Construction" in Hsinchu, and the two sides officially joined hands to become the team's title sponsor for this exhibition game, known as the "Hsinchu Da Yan Lion City Lions". This morning, the Muse Girls and mascot Rudy led a group of fans to tour the historic buildings in Singapore, including the Asian Civilization Museum, Victoria Theatre, Old Singapore Parliament Building, and the Merlion Park. They also designed interactive games during the trip to help fans get to know the Muse Girls and mascot Rudy better, and create unforgettable memories with the Lion City Lions during this trip.

Muse Girls captain Linlin happily stated: "This is my first time traveling with fans as a cheerleader, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make fans support the Lion City Lions even more. I also hope that after this international exchange event, Muse Girls can increase their popularity in Asia!" The Lion City Lions started the game against the Singapore Slingers at noon at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. In order to allow local and foreign players to bond through the game, the Lion City Lions sent high Guo Hao, Wang Zigang, Shi Yanzong, Berlin, and Euro Lion Fu as the starting lineup.

From the beginning, the Lion City Lions showed their determination to win, and with a double-digit lead, the bench players also contributed to the team's victory, including Zhang Jiewei, Liu Guangshang, and Jiang Guangqian, who scored 12, 11, and 10 points respectively. The Lion City Lions defeated the Singapore Slingers 84:61.

It was Euro Lion Fu's first time representing the Lion City Lions in a public game, and he scored 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 blocks with an 83% shooting percentage in just 15 minutes of play. He was also voted as the best player of the game by the fans at the scene. Euro Lion Fu said: "I am very happy that I was able to help the team win in my first game. Even though we were playing in a different city today, having fans from Hsinchu coming to watch the game made me feel like I was playing at home. I also believe that with this kind of team atmosphere, I can quickly integrate into the team."

When asked about the team's chemistry, head coach Lin Guanlun stated: "Today's main goal was team integration, while also giving our young players more opportunities to improve. Due to the limited time our foreign players had for team practice, I hope they can become more familiar with the team through games. Today was a test for our new lineup." The Hsinchu Da Yan Lion City Lions and the Singapore Slingers participated in the 2023 FIBA Intercontinental Cup exhibition game in Singapore.
