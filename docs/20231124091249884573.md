Yesterday, Jeremy Lin signed with the New Taipei Kings, forming the "Lin Brothers Backcourt" with his younger brother Lin Shu-Wei. This greatly enhances the strength of the New Taipei Kings. The exact time for Jeremy Lin to join the team has not been confirmed yet, and whether it will be a one-year contract is still under discussion. Mao Jia-En revealed earlier that Lin Shu-Wei played an important role in Jeremy Lin's signing: "Shu-Wei actually played a crucial role in this matter. The two had detailed communication this summer and reached consensus on all aspects. They agreed to be teammates this season and challenge this new possibility together. They support each other 100%. After confirming all these ideas, they started to negotiate with the team." After Jeremy Lin's signing, the issue of jersey number overlapping with Lin Li-Ren also caught the attention of fans. Mao said that Lin Li-Ren generously gave up No. 7 for Jeremy Lin.

"Because this decision was made in a hurry, before the announcement of the signing, Jeremy Lin asked me (GM Mao Jia-En) to seek Lin Li-Ren's consent to get the No. 7 jersey. Lin Li-Ren agreed to this; later, Jeremy Lin expressed his gratitude to Lin Li-Ren in person after arriving in Taiwan."
