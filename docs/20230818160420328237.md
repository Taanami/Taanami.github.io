  LeBron James, the NBA Lakers player, scored 38 points in a game on the 8th, accumulating a total of 38,390 points in his NBA career. This surpasses the record of 38,387 points set by "The Skyhook" Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, making LeBron James the all-time leading scorer in NBA history.

The top five scorers in the NBA all-time scoring list are currently LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, and Michael Jordan, with LeBron James being the only active player among them.

LeBron James joined the NBA in the 2003-04 season at the age of 19. He has played 1,410 games over 21 seasons to achieve this scoring record.

His career average points per game is 27.2 points. Comparing the average points per game in each season, his highest average occurred in the 2005-06 season, with 31.4 points per game. The lowest average points per game occurred in his first year in the NBA, with an average of 20.9 points per game. However, apart from his rookie year, his average points per game in other seasons have never been below 25 points.

As LeBron James is still an active player, his points in each game will continue to raise the highest record of total NBA points.

He currently needs 1,610 points to reach the milestone of 40,000 points. Let's calculate how many games he needs to play based on his past average points per game record. Looking at his past three seasons, where he played at least 45 games per season (the lowest in his career), regardless of the above calculation, as long as he maintains good health, LeBron James is very likely to achieve the milestone of 40,000 total points in the next season (2024-25).
