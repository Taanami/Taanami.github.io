  Hangzhou Asian Games: The Three Musketeers of the Asian Cup 3x3 Basketball Team

In the "Hangzhou Asian Games-05," 3x3 basketball, which became an official event at the previous Jakarta Asian Games, the Chinese men's basketball team missed out on the chance to win a medal after a one-point loss to Iran in the semifinals. This time, they have sent the Three Musketeers - Lin Xinkuan, Jiang Jun, and Yu Xiangping - who performed well in the Asian Cup, along with their new teammate Wang Zheyu. Led by coach Wu Zhengjie from Jinhua High School, the team hopes to achieve great success and bring glory to their country. Read on for more details.

In the previous Asian Games in Jakarta, 3x3 basketball became an official event, and the Chinese men's basketball team formed a lineup consisting of top players from the University Basketball Association (UBA), including Zeng Xiangjun, Zhu Yunhao, Jian Youzhe, and Zhou Weichen, under the coaching of Yang Zheyi, the head coach of the Fu Jen Catholic University men's basketball team.

In the first game of the group stage, they faced Mongolia and all four players performed well, both inside and outside the court, securing a victory. However, in the following match against South Korea, despite Zhu Yunhao's four three-pointers, they couldn't overcome their opponent's strong offense and lost by two points. In the last two games against weaker teams Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh, they had an easy time winning with a large point difference, securing two consecutive victories. With a net point difference of 29 points, they closely followed South Korea and advanced to the next stage as the second-placed team in their group.

In the semifinals, the teams were matched based on their rankings, and the Chinese team faced the tall and strong Iranian team. Despite the height support from Zeng Xiangjun in the paint, they struggled on the rebounds and found it difficult to extend their lead. In the end, they were eliminated with a one-point loss of 17-18. Three members of the original Asian Games representative team are now developing their careers in the PLG league, while one member is fighting in the SBL league. They have a complete lineup from guards to forwards and centers, with their fierce outside shooting being their biggest weapon. Their similar ages allow for good chemistry, and they can hold their ground against strong opponents. Overall, their performance is quite impressive.

The Three Musketeers of the Asian Cup are ready to compete again and hope to continue their good performance in the Asian Games. The men's 3x3 basketball team for the current Hangzhou Asian Games consists of the main core players from the previous Asian Cup, including Lin Xinkuan from Taiwan Beer, Jiang Jun from Fu Jen Catholic University, and Yu Xiangping from Yulon Luxgen Dinos. They are joined by the new addition Wang Zheyu, forming a strong lineup of four versatile players. Under the guidance of coach Wu Zhengjie from Jinhua High School, they aim to showcase the chemistry and teamwork they developed in the Asian Cup and achieve even better results in the Asian Games.

In the group stage, they will compete against Hong Kong, Jordan, the Philippines, and Mongolia, aiming to finish in the top two to advance to the next stage.

Mongolia is the strongest team in this group, winning the Asian Cup with dominant performances, averaging 20.8 points per game. They are a team that all the others need to be cautious of. Excluding Hong Kong, the strength of the Chinese team, Jordan, and the Philippines is similar. The situation could evolve into a three-way battle, so they need to be careful and not underestimate their opponents. Otherwise, it would be a pity if they were eliminated in the group stage. The team's ability to make an impact is highly regarded. Compared to the previous tournament, where they heavily relied on outside shooting, this time they have added more penetration, bringing more physical contact and easier scoring opportunities from free throws. 

The Chinese team, which finished ninth in the previous Asian Cup, has a balanced attack between the inside and outside. It proves that they are not limited to a certain scoring method. All four players can shoot from the outside and have physicality to compete. After going through this period of training and development, Lin Xinkuan and Jiang Jun have shown significant improvement, shedding their youthful inexperience. The lineup of four versatile players not only has height but also excels in rebounding, ranking first among all teams with an average of 21.5 rebounds per game. This will be a key factor in competing for a good placement in the Asian Games. Although they may lack agility, their defensive intensity is commendable. As long as they rotate and cover well, their defense will be strong.

Jinhua High School has always been a cradle for cultivating basketball talents, and coach Wu Zhengjie is trustworthy. Jiang Jun also comes from this school, and he and Wang Zheyu were high school teammates, so their chemistry is unquestionable.

Lin Xinkuan will undoubtedly be the team's leader. After his experience in the Jones Cup, his shooting has become quicker, and he utilizes his body more effectively. He is the key player on offense and can be relied upon for scoring. It's hard to find many players who can stop him before reaching the quarterfinals.

Therefore, it is not impossible for them to advance to the medal round, but they need to demonstrate a stronger performance on both offense and defense. Japan and South Korea are traditional powerhouses, and with the rise of Mongolia, West Asia, and other countries, the competition in this year's Asian Games is expected to be even more intense than the previous edition. The schedule for the 3x3 basketball event at the Hangzhou Asian Games is as follows: Group stage from September 25 to September 29, and the knockout stage and medal matches from September 30 to October 1.
