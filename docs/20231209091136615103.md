On November 18, 2023, reporters Li Longgui and Zhang Hongye from the United Daily News reported from Taipei that Yulon basketball player Ko Min-hao (center) was also brought in for questioning by the Criminal Bureau in the afternoon.

Most players were tightly controlled by Ko, who was the MVP of last season, and FMVP Banba, responsible for manipulating game results.

Reporter Yu Chenghan/Photo CBA SBL Yulon basketball team former player Wu Jiyin was exposed to be involved in match-fixing and gambling, causing a continuous uproar. Yesterday, the Criminal Bureau conducted a large-scale search of Yulon player dormitories and residences of the involved individuals. A total of 16 people, including players, current and former coaches, and security guards, were summoned for questioning. Nine players were accused, including the Senegalese player Banba, who was once the MVP of the finals, and the well-known guard Ko Min-hao. The scandal has severely damaged the image of the Yulon team, and there are concerns that the team may be disbanded. Twelve people were transferred to the prosecutor's office for overnight interrogation, and compulsory measures are not ruled out. Wu Jiyin was found to be involved in fraud, gambling, and violation of the Sports Lottery Issuance Regulations. He was previously released on bail of 250,000 yuan. It is understood that after Wu Jiyin was released on bail, the prosecution received another report stating that other players were also involved. Some players also acted as organizers and gamblers, and made profits by manipulating game performance according to their bets.

The relevant reports were sent through anonymous online accounts, along with dialogue records related to gambling between the involved individuals. The prosecution conducted a thorough investigation and found abnormal financial flows into the bank accounts of some players or their relatives, expanding the investigation.

One player testified that the main figure in the case was Ko Min-hao, who acted as the "white glove" and worked with Wu Jiyin to manipulate games and distribute money. They used money as an incentive to recruit other players to participate in match-fixing. Even if the players did not want to cooperate by influencing the game or placing bets, they could still receive dividends after the game, with each person receiving 5,000 yuan. The details of the distribution are waiting to be investigated by the prosecution. The task force also simultaneously summoned security guard Wei Jiawei and player Li Qi'en. The summoned individuals also included Yulon's current coach Li Qiyi and former coach Qiu Dazong (now the coach of the PLG team Kaohsiung Steelmen in the CBA), to clarify whether they were aware of players involved in match-fixing.

Li Qiyi cooperated with the summons in the morning when the prosecution arrived at his door. Qiu Dazong arrived at the prosecutor's office in the afternoon and when leaving, he told the media that "players should just focus on playing well." It is reported that among the 12 accused, most of the players involved were tightly controlled by Banba and Ko Min-hao on the court. However, the two firmly denied any involvement in gambling or match-fixing, and another player was also identified as being involved in match-fixing and may be added to the list of accused.
