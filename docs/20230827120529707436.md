Since joining the team in a mid-season trade last year, White has seamlessly integrated into the Celtics. Despite the emphasis on team basketball in the Spurs, he has proven to be the best supporting role alongside the duo of J's. After further assimilation into the system during the offseason, he became the team's third most important player in the current season. He played the entire season without missing a game, earning a spot on the All-Defensive Second Team and even being selected as the Player of the Week. His performance has exceeded the expectations of all fans.

With Smart's departure, White unquestionably became the starting point guard. His off-ball movement and receiving skills are excellent, especially his improved shooting from the perimeter, with a nearly 7% increase in three-point shooting percentage. This is the much-needed weapon alongside the duo of J's, allowing for better cohesion in the team's overall strategy.

- [Offensive Analysis] Since joining the team last year, White has briefly showcased his ball-handling abilities. When he demonstrates aggression with the ball, the team's offense always manages to break through. However, the offensive system last year was not as complete, and during the playoffs, he had very few opportunities to handle the ball. He was often left waiting as a spot-up shooter when the ball was given to the duo of J's, and he didn't always receive opportunities for cuts. Therefore, he couldn't fully unleash his offensive threat. As expected at the start of this season, after more time to gel with the team, White has transformed. Although his shot attempts have slightly decreased with Brogdon's arrival, his spot-up three-point shooting percentage has risen to 37.8%, greatly enhancing his value in half-court offense. He has near 40% shooting from both the top of the arc and the corners, overcoming the lack of confidence he showed in shooting last year.

In addition to improving his three-point accuracy, White has reduced pull-up jump shots and increased his attempts at drives and floaters. Especially when he has the ball, he no longer hesitates as much, and with his physique, he can easily penetrate past many guards. It is common to see him taking floaters near the free-throw line after driving from the middle, and when the duo of J's attracts the defense on the sides, White's aggressiveness is sure to yield great results. Furthermore, he has done well in leading the second unit. When Williams III was absent at the start of the season, White was able to lead players like Kornet, Hauser, and Griffin to achieve good results. He has been a key factor in the team's success in the first half of the season.

The most impressive aspect is White's performance in February. When Brown suffered a facial fracture from a hit by Tatum and Smart's ankle injury was recurring, White's role naturally increased. His shot attempts multiplied, but his shooting efficiency increased as well. He averaged nearly 20 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game that month. He even won Player of the Week and scored a career-high 33 points, including eight three-pointers, against the Hornets. This performance showed that he is capable of replacing the team's main players.

- [Defensive Analysis] In addition to his offensive improvements, White has made a significant contribution to the team's backcourt defense this year. Alongside Smart, they form a formidable defensive duo. His greatest contribution, in my opinion, is his ability to defend at the point of attack. He can use his speed and leaping ability to chase and defend against all guards in the league. Even when facing taller scoring guards, his defensive discipline and accuracy do not put him at a disadvantage. In addition to one-on-one defense, whether it's defending pick-and-rolls or guarding shooters off-ball, you can see that White is the most proactive player in bypassing screens and recovering on defense. He anticipates and disrupts lobs to the roller, contests jump shots after defending screens, and steals the ball during low-post matchups with centers. He has taken over the role that Smart used to fulfill.

Although White hasn't shown much in terms of directing the defense, which is a concern after Smart's departure, it will be a challenge for the new season. Instead of focusing on his command, it's more about establishing better communication and understanding among the players. Paying attention to his pick-and-roll defense with KP and his defensive chemistry with the perimeter defense of the duo of J's will be crucial to the team's overall defense.

- [Playoff Performance] In the first round of the playoffs, White excelled in locking down Young on defense. Utilizing his size advantage and defensive footwork, he was able to anticipate and defend against every drive and floater attempt by the opponent. He also frequently disrupted high lob passes, forcing Young to rely on mismatches and outside shooting for offense. He held his matchup to a shooting percentage of only 31.4%.

Offensively, he performed on par with the Hawks' guards, providing a consistent scoring threat outside the duo of J's with his shooting percentages of around 50.
