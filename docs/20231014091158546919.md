NBA Kerr Discusses Warriors' Defensive Goals to Rebuild Top 10 Defense in the League GPII Is an Important Player for Us

Today marks the official start of training camp for all teams in the league, and Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr discussed the team's defensive strategy for the season. He stated that their goal is to rebuild their defense, with a specific focus on having Klay Thompson guard the power forward position and highlighting the importance of Gary Payton II as a key defensive player for the team.

Kerr first addressed the strengths of their starting frontcourt players: "Looney protects the paint, Green covers the entire court like a safety in American football, and Wiggins will need to guard wings from all teams in the league."

When it comes to their starting lineup, Kerr will likely have Chris Paul, Curry, and Thompson on the court together at times. In these situations, Thompson will guard the power forward position alongside Looney/Green and Wiggins. Kerr explained, "Thompson will be guarding the four this season, as he is physically strong. He will switch onto low-post players after defensive rotations, and we believe he can handle guarding the four. We plan to use this defensive setup against teams running pick-and-roll plays to see how he performs."

Kerr also mentioned another strong player in their defense, Chris Paul. He described him as "strong as a rock or brick," making it difficult for opponents to switch onto him. However, it will depend on the team's defensive strategy and who they want Paul to guard. Finally, Kerr mentioned Gary Payton II as a key name in their defensive strategy. He sees him as the core of the Warriors' defense, excelling at guarding ball-handlers. Although he only played in 23 games last season, Kerr believes that his return will make rebuilding their defense much easier. He also expects Payton to be part of the Warriors' rotation.

Kerr stated, "I expect him to come off the bench like two years ago, and I anticipate him having important minutes on the court. If he continues to contribute, I will keep him on the court." As for his jersey number for the new season, Payton will return to wearing the number 0 jersey, as it was taken by another player after he was traded last season.

Finally, Kerr expressed his expectations for Payton: "He has a significant impact on our defense, and we are glad to have him back. He is an essential member of our team."
