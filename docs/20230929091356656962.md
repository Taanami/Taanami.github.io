  Curry's three-point record may be broken by Buddy Hield's potential long-term threat

Two years ago, Stephen Curry surpassed Ray Allen with a career three-point shooting percentage of 42.8%, breaking the personal three-point record in NBA history and establishing himself as the greatest shooter in NBA history.

To this day, as we approach the 2023-24 season, Curry remains in top form, with a career total of 3390 three-pointers, ready to continue piling up the record. And judging by Curry's current form and style of play, if he wants to, he has a great chance of playing well into his forties. If Curry does play for such a long time, there is a very good chance that he will surpass 4000 career three-pointers.

Please continue reading. 4000 is an astonishing number, almost impossible to achieve and break in the NBA. Even if there is a chance, it would likely take a very long time.

However, interestingly, there is a player among active players quietly chasing this Hall of Fame level super shooter, and his name is not one that resonates loudly in the NBA, nor is he a player that the average fan would think of as a superstar.

That's right, it's not James Harden, although currently ranked third, Harden's career three-point shooting percentage of 36.3% and his age of 34 make it difficult for him to catch up. And it's not Luka Doncic either. While he may have a chance to surpass 3000 career three-pointers, his current shooting accuracy of 33.8% needs to reach another level to compete at the level of 4000. 

Some might guess Damian Lillard and Paul George, who possess top-notch accuracy. They are currently ranked 10th and 26th, respectively, and have a chance to reach the top five in history. However, like Harden, they are both 33 years old and in the later stages of their careers, making it difficult for them to catch up to Curry.

Many might guess that it's Curry's current teammate Klay Thompson, who is currently ranked 18th on the three-point leaderboard. Initially, "Splash Brother" Klay had a chance, but two major injuries significantly slowed down his progress. Without those two major injuries, he might have already surpassed 2300 three-pointers and ranked 6th while still in his prime. However, Thompson is also 34 years old, making it equally difficult for him to keep up with Curry's pace. Please continue reading. So who is the most likely candidate? You read it right, it's Buddy Hield. Photo source: Getty Images. Currently playing for the Indiana Pacers, Hield has a career three-point shooting percentage of 40.2%. In the past five seasons, Hield has ranked either second or fourth in total three-pointers made for four seasons.

Since the 2017-18 season, no player, including Curry, has made more three-pointers than Hield's 1557.

In the past five seasons, Hield has averaged 276 three-pointers per season. If he can maintain that level in the 2023-24 season, he will rise from 29th to 17th on the all-time list. If he can maintain it for another season, he will surpass Dirk Nowitzki and become 16th. If he can make a few more and reach 284, he will surpass Jason Kidd and become 15th. In the 2022-23 season, Hield made 288 three-pointers in a single season, second only to Thompson's 301.

Hield is currently 30 years old and has played at least 70 games in each of the past six seasons. He has played 80 games in four seasons and has only missed three games in the past two seasons. Please continue reading. Let's assume that both Hield and Curry can play until the age of 40. That means Curry has about five more seasons, while Hield has ten more seasons.

Hield's average of three-pointers per season has already surpassed Curry's (around 243). If Hield can maintain an average of 276 three-pointers per season until the age of 40, his career total will approach 4500. If Curry can maintain a level of 300 three-pointers per season for the next five years, he will accumulate approximately 4890 career three-pointers, which is still far beyond Hield. However, this is an overly optimistic assumption, as Curry's injuries and declining skills will have an impact. As long as Hield can have a breakout season two or three times in the coming years, he may have a chance to get closer, or even challenge Curry's record.

However, in reality, it is still very challenging for Hield to surpass Curry's record, mainly due to the significant gap in shooting consistency between Hield and Curry.

In Hield's nine-year career, he has only had four seasons with a three-point shooting percentage above 40%. On the other hand, excluding the injury-plagued 2019-20 season, Curry has only had one season with a three-point shooting percentage below 40%. But based on the current accumulation and form, Hield is the most likely candidate to challenge Curry, and he still has several good years ahead of him. Most importantly, Hield is very healthy and his playing style is less prone to injury. Even as he ages, in this era of three-point shooting, as long as he is willing, he will definitely have playing opportunities. According to Synergy's data, in the 2022-23 season, Hield had a 45.8% catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage, a 42% pull-up jump shot three-point shooting percentage, a 41.5% catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage, and a 61.5% step-back three-point shooting percentage. Overall, his three-point shooting percentage reached an impressive 42.5%, with the left and right corner three-point shooting percentages reaching 51.1% and 45.7%, respectively.
