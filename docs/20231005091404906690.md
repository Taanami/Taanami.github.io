  38-year-old Lakers star LeBron James becomes the first player in NBA history to average 28.9 points in his 20th season

The NBA playoffs will begin today, with Lakers star LeBron James completing his 20th regular season of his career.

According to statistics, James averaged 28.9 points this season, the highest among players who have completed their 20th season. Despite only playing 55 games due to injuries, James still led the team with an average of 28.9 points. If he had played more games, the 38-year-old James would have ranked 7th on the league's scoring list. On January 31st, James recorded 28 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds, leading the team to victory with an excellent triple-double performance.

In NBA history, there are a total of 11 players who have played at least 20 seasons, including James this season and recently retired Heat leader Udonis Haslem, 42. However, only James can perform as well as the young players. According to StatMuse, a US statistical media, James averaged 28.9 points in his 20th season. The player behind him is the late Lakers star Kobe Bryant, who averaged 17.6 points in his 20th season in 2015-16. The third-ranked player is Dirk Nowitzki in 2017-18, who averaged 12 points.

James entered the NBA draft in 2003 right after graduating from high school and joined the Cleveland Cavaliers as the first overall pick that year. Since 2006, the NBA has banned high school graduates from directly joining the league, so James had an advantage by starting a year earlier. According to ESPN, James mentioned in an interview that he owes his ability to play 20 seasons at a high level to his personal trainer, Mike Mancias.

James said, "Without him, it would have been impossible for me to maintain this level of play. He plays a crucial role in my games and my performance. I could have played 7 to 12 seasons on my own, but 20 seasons without him would not have been possible."

Mancias was hired as the Cavaliers' assistant strength and conditioning coach in the 2002 season and developed a good working relationship with James, who joined the team the following year. Since 2004, James has employed him as his personal trainer.
