 In the game between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Denver Nuggets, in the third quarter after a foul was called on Grizzlies player Xavier Tillman, Nikola Jokic and the referee quickly initiated the inbound pass. Jokic threw the ball to the other end of the court where his teammate Aaron Gordon completed an aerial relay, prompting a timeout from the Grizzlies coach. The Nuggets ultimately won the game with Jokic recording a near triple-double of 22 points, 12 rebounds, and 7 assists, while Jamal Murray also contributed 22 points and 5 assists. Six players from the Grizzlies scored in double figures, but Jaren Jackson Jr.'s last shot did not go in and a subsequent foul gave the Nuggets a four-point lead from the free throw line, securing their victory.
