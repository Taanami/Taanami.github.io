 Discussion on the first offseason of the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement (CBA): Who benefits and who loses?

The new version of the NBA's collective bargaining agreement, known as the CBA, went into effect on July 1st! With the first offseason under the new agreement, there have been significant changes in the league's ecosystem and operations due to rule changes. As we look back on the first offseason under the new CBA, who has benefited and who has suffered? The end of superteams? As I mentioned in my article at the end of June, with the implementation of the second Apron (Super Tax), many powerhouse teams cannot avoid the fate of salary clean-up. Examples include the Warriors trading Jordan Poole, the Clippers giving up on Eric Gordon, and the Hawks selling John Collins.

The Phoenix Suns, however, have shown a completely opposite approach. They traded Wizards star Bradley Beal before the new CBA took effect, maximizing their cap space. This may be the last super team in the NBA for the foreseeable future.

Under the new CBA, once a team's total salary exceeds the second Apron, they can no longer use the mid-level exception or sign-and-trade, and the flexibility of trade amounts will be restricted. The future first-round draft picks will directly become the 30th pick, making the cost much heavier than the luxury tax.

While it may be worth taking risks in the short term for a championship, it will be challenging to maintain a roster with three superstars (whose salaries account for more than 30% of the cap) in the long term.

Take the Suns as an example. Kevin Durant and Beal will account for approximately 35% of the cap in the upcoming season, while Devin Booker will be at 26%. However, starting from the 2024-25 season, with the new contracts in effect, their salaries will collectively exceed the cap by approximately 105%, putting them in an overflow state. From a salary perspective alone, Deandre Ayton's contract will likely need to be traded. I believe the Suns will not be able to sustain the trio of superstars for long and will have to face the reality in the short term. The next team facing a salary crisis is the Timberwolves. They signed Anthony Edwards to a five-year, $259 million extension this summer, effective from the 2024-25 season. When combined with Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert's contracts, they will consume 90% of the salary cap. Unless the Timberwolves can rapidly grow and prove that their twin towers can compete for a championship, they will soon face the punishment of the second Apron. The Clippers, who already have an exploding salary cap, must make decisions in the new season and expedite the turnover of their high-priced veteran players like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard to alleviate the salary pressure.

This year and the next will be a transitional period, where powerhouse teams will have to slow down and adjust their rosters. They will no longer be able to use the "silver bullet" strategy to strengthen their teams. Teams like the Suns, Timberwolves, Warriors, and Clippers may find more suitable role players through trades, but it will be challenging to sustain their current salary levels for an extended period. If they don't trade high-salary players, they will have to face rebuilding. However, don't worry, I believe the resilient NBA executives will still be able to form super teams. However, if they fail to win a championship, the fall will be even more painful than before.

Less financially strong teams will benefit from the more flexible trade and signing exceptions under the new CBA. Many trade restrictions have been eased, and more exceptions can be used as long as the team's total salary is below the two Apron thresholds. The Cavaliers, for example, saved up to $7.5 million in the price difference to complete the sign-and-trade for Max Strus (4 years, $63 million). Under the old rules, the Cavaliers would have had to offer a higher-priced contract to the Heat. The Rockets also benefited from this new rule by signing Dillon Brooks. Second-round picks now have their own exceptions.

Unlike first-round picks with standardized contracts, second-round picks previously had to use salary cap space or split the mid-level exception to sign 3-4 year contracts. The new second-round exception clause solves this problem.

The Kings used this exception to sign Colby Jones, the 34th pick, to a 4-year, $8.76 million contract, while the Hawks signed Mouhamed Gueye, the 39th pick, to a 4-year, $7.63 million contract with a team option in the last year. This is seen as a solution to avoid a repeat of the "Jalen Brunson situation." If the team does not exercise the last year of the contract, the player becomes a restricted free agent, giving them the right to receive offers from other teams, unlike Brunson, who had to watch as the Mavericks let him go. In 2021, the Nuggets signed Michael Porter Jr. to a designated rookie contract extension worth $179.29 million over 5 years, which sparked a discussion. Previously, teams were limited to two designated players, but with the new version of the CBA, this restriction has been removed, and first-round picks can now sign 5-year contracts without any conditions.

Therefore, we see players like Desmond Bane of the Grizzlies signing a 5-year, $197.23 million contract, slightly below the 25% max salary, but still a long-term deal.

This is a sign that the NBA is encouraging the draft and the development of rookies, giving the home team more incentives and conditions to retain young players.

Restricted free agents have a tough time. While the advantage of re-signing with the home team is amplified, it also diminishes the player's bargaining power, especially when they become restricted free agents. We saw this with Deandre Ayton last year, and this year with P.J. Washington and Austin Reaves, who entered the market as restricted free agents but chose to accept new contracts from their respective teams instead of seeking offers from other teams. According to rumors, the Spurs initially planned to offer Reaves a contract worth $100 million over 4 years or $60 million over 3 years. However, when they heard that the Lakers were interested, they didn't even make an offer. In the end, Reaves received a 4-year, $56 million contract from the Lakers.

Washington, on the other hand, waited for offers from other teams but ended up without any, choosing to sign a 3-year, $48 million contract with the Hornets.

The issue is not the reasonable value of Washington and Reaves' contracts but rather the weakened bargaining power of restricted free agents. Because the home team has the unconditional right to match any offer, other teams must offer slightly higher contracts to deter the home team. In Washington's case, some teams may have deemed it not cost-effective. If a player is attractive enough, like Reaves, who had interest from the Lakers, why would other teams waste their time? The back and forth between the player and the home team usually results in the player not getting the ideal contract value. In terms of specifications, Washington and Reaves could have chosen to accept the qualifying offer (QO) and become unrestricted free agents after one more year, but it would come with the risk of entering the free market. An interesting exception is that restricted free agents can also be used as a way to mess with other teams. The Jazz made an offer to Paul Reed, the backup center for the 76ers, for 3 years and $23 million, with a rare condition that the contract is fully guaranteed in the first season, but if the team reaches the second round of the playoffs, the following two years will also become fully guaranteed. However, it will be challenging for the rebuilding Jazz to meet this condition, while the 76ers have a higher chance of making it to the second round.

In the free market, things are chilly. Apart from re-signings, only Max Strus, Bruce Brown Jr., Fred VanVleet, and Dillon Brooks have received new contracts exceeding the full mid-level exception.

If we exclude Strus, there are only around 7-10 teams that can clear enough cap space to sign eight-figure contracts, and only the Pacers and Rockets are willing to spend.

Analyzing the strategies of these two teams, it is clear that they are not truly strengthening their teams but rather focusing on filling the salary floor. The contracts of Brown Jr. and VanVleet include team-friendly options.

The new game rules under the new CBA clearly encourage trades and raise the conditions for re-signing. When players can earn a significant amount by staying with their home team, more players are willing to commit to long-term contracts, resulting in fewer players entering the free market. This also fills up the salary cap space of various teams before the offseason even starts.

Since 2018-2019, apart from Fred VanVleet receiving a max contract this year, the last player to sign a max contract in free agency relying on cap space was Kawhi Leonard in 2019 and LeBron James in 2018. Most players have had to rely on trades or re-signings.

The new version of the CBA requires teams to reach the salary floor threshold on the first day of the season; otherwise, they cannot participate in the luxury tax distribution. This has put pressure on teams to spend money in the offseason. While teams like the Pacers and Rockets have offered inflated contracts, many rebuilding teams have filled their cap space through trades and invested in functional veteran players.

Instead of conducting large-scale experiments with cap space as they did in the past, many rebuilding teams this offseason have been able to reap rewards, providing better development opportunities for young players and making the games more exciting.
