In 2023, he was also selected for the Jones Cup Chinese White team, and will now defend the Taiwan Steel Falcons' paint. Known for his speed, Bai Sa, standing at 183 cm tall, averaged 6.5 points, 2.5 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 1.4 steals in the 2022-23 season.

General Manager Qian Wei-Cheng stated that all three new players have shown outstanding performance in both offense and defense, as well as a wealth of experience on the court.
