 NBA couldn't sign Nerlens Noel for more than two months and then cut him after signing JaVale McGee in the summer.

According to ESPN reporter Adrian Wojnarowski, the Kings will release Nerlens Noel and young player Neemias Queta, whom they just signed from free agency this summer. This decision was mainly due to the signing of JaVale McGee, who was recently released by the Mavericks.

On July 19th of this year, the Kings reached a one-year $3.1 million contract agreement with Noel (news link), but in less than two months, the signing of McGee deepened the depth at the center position, prompting the Kings to cut both centers at once. At the time, there were reports that Noel's contract was not fully guaranteed, and he would have to play the entire season to receive the full $3.1 million. Unexpectedly, within less than two months, the Kings found a better replacement for the center position and decided to let Noel go and find a new team. As a result, the Kings' center rotation will have Domantas Sabonis as the starting center, with Alex Len and JaVale McGee as backups. In the 2022-23 regular season, Nerlens Noel played for the Pistons and Nets, appearing in a total of 17 games with an average of 11.5 minutes per game, scoring 2.1 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 0.9 steals.
