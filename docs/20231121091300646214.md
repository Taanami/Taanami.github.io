On September 11th, T1 Basketball held a press conference with Taipei War God team leader, Shang Ruiqiang, accompanying player Lin Ping-Sheng to address recent controversies surrounding Lin's contract.

Shang emphasized during the conference that Taishin Recreation and Lin's contract signing process were both in accordance with regulations. He expressed regret for the lawsuit and assured that the Taipei War God team will defend the company and player's rights and interests, while also being open to the public.

Regarding the contract dispute, Lin Ping-Sheng first sincerely apologized at the press conference and thanked the media and fans for their concerns.

As for the trouble caused between the War God team and Taishin team, he also expressed his deepest apologies. At the press conference, Lin Ping-Sheng explained the whole situation.

Firstly, on May 25th, Mr. Zhang Yunzhi from Hsinchu City War God team contacted Lin Ping-Sheng through the current general manager of the War God team (then T1 League secretary-general), Mr. Zhang Shuren, to discuss the process. During the negotiations, Lin reminded them that according to the previous team's contract regulations, the War God team should first present an offer and only after the previous team's response, if the offer does not match, then they can sign the contract.

However, in reality, before Lin Ping-Sheng terminated the contract and obtained a proof of departure to become a free agent, Mr. Zhang Yunzhi from Hsinchu City War God team still told Lin, "It's okay to sign first." Secondly, the representative of the War God team also stated that they would add a clause to the contract that would not violate the previous team's contract regulations. Therefore, Lin Ping-Sheng believed that it was in line with regulations and without much thought, signed an appointment contract with the War God team on May 28th. However, this contract did not specify the start and end date of the appointment and set September 1st as the effective date.

Later, when facing contact with other teams, the War God team also told Lin Ping-Sheng to keep it confidential and low-key. But after consulting with a lawyer about this contract, Lin Ping-Sheng realized that the appointment contract did not comply with procedures. Therefore, before confirming joining the Taishin team, Lin Ping-Sheng hoped to terminate the contract with the War God team. As a result, on June 28th, Lin Ping-Sheng informed Mr. Zhang Yunzhi of his decision not to join and apologized. After that, he also made it clear to the representative of the War God team that he had no intention of joining.

The next day, on August 14th, Mr. Zhang Shuren contacted him and hoped to meet and discuss the contract after the Jones Cup tournament. During the meeting, Lin Ping-Sheng once again refused to join the War God team. The next day, on August 15th, Lin Ping-Sheng called Mr. Zhang Shuren and expressed the same decision not to join the War God team, and Mr. Zhang Shuren replied, "The War God team will not announce the joining." After that, Lin Ping-Sheng also sent messages to Mr. Zhang Yunzhi and Mr. Zhang Shuren to express his position of not joining.

Unexpectedly, at noon on the same day (August 15th), the War God team still announced the joining information. Therefore, on the morning of August 16th, Lin Ping-Sheng officially sent a letter of evidence to the War God team to express the termination of the previously signed unenforceable appointment contract. After obtaining a proof of departure from the previous team, Lin Ping-Sheng signed with the Taipei War God team, and the whole process was in line with regulations.

Lin Ping-Sheng emphasized that his decision to join the Taipei War God team was based on the team's complete plan for overseas development, and the salary was similar to that of the War God team. However, the contract with the Taipei War God team was shorter, and the total salary was not as high as that of the War God team, contrary to rumors. The Taipei War God team condemned the malicious slandering and false accusations made by the War God team about Lin Ping-Sheng's contract dispute, and thanked the Basketball Association for its assistance. On September 4th, the Basketball Association held a hearing, and before the meeting, the Taipei War God team had provided relevant documents in accordance with the Basketball Association's letter and also attended. Lin Ping-Sheng had also informed the Basketball Association in advance that he would have a lawyer present, and it was not as the War God team claimed that he was "absent without reason." In addition, the Basketball Association's press release after the hearing clearly stated that "the meeting has not reached a conclusion," but the Taipei War God team was repeatedly attacked by the Hsinchu City War God team for not "sincere in negotiation, evading responsibility, not in line with the consensus of the hearing, and having a fluctuating attitude." They attempted to create a negative image of the Taipei War God team to cover up their malicious slander and unreasonable demands, which was despicable and set a bad example for the sports industry.

The Taipei War God team emphasized that they have always valued harmony and did not want to speak through the media. They are deeply regretful for resorting to litigation, but they have been repeatedly subjected to malicious attacks and unreasonable demands, and they can no longer remain silent. Therefore, they will fight to protect Taishin Recreation Company and the player's rights and interests.

Since the controversy, the War God team's statements are inconsistent with the actual situation. Therefore, Lin Ping-Sheng held a press conference today with the Taipei War God team to explain the truth and hope to avoid the continuous spread of one-sided false information on the internet.

At the end of the press conference, Lin Ping-Sheng once again expressed his personal apologies for causing trouble to the team and the recent disturbances in society and the basketball circle. He also hoped that everyone could give him a chance, and in the future, he will be more cautious and seek assistance from professional managers in handling contract matters.

Facing the upcoming new season, Lin Ping-Sheng said he will focus on personal training and show his best performance on the court. He hopes everyone can continue to support him. The case has now been brought to the legal process, and everything will be left to the judiciary. Finally, the Taipei War God team once again strongly urged the Hsinchu City War God team to exercise restraint and stop spreading false information and wasting social resources. They also hope that the public will not be misled by false information. Taishin provided a timeline of the incident: May 25th, May 27th, May 28th, June 25th, June 28th, August 14th, August 15th, August 16th.
