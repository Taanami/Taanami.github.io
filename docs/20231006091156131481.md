 Trey Murphy's training process was interrupted due to a meniscus injury, and further evaluation will determine if surgery is necessary. Meniscus injuries are typically treated in two ways: surgery, which requires several months of recovery, or non-surgical treatment, which has a shorter timeline of about 6-8 weeks and would only cause him to miss a few weeks of the upcoming season. Murphy had an impressive performance last season, averaging 14.5 points, 3.6 rebounds, and shooting 40% from three-point range and 90% from the free-throw line. He ranked fifth in the league for catch-and-shoot three-pointers made, making him a valuable young player for the Pelicans.
