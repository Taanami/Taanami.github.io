The new leader of the Wolves is more comprehensive and steady, facing challenges in the new season. Source: Spectrum News Except for the Celtics, the opponents the Wolves have faced this week are either rebuilding teams or teams with significant injuries, making it predictable for them to win four consecutive games. 

 However, for fans who have memories of the Wolves' situation last season, they know that the team has a problem of being strong against strong teams and weak against weak teams. This includes being swept by the Pistons and losing to the depleted Trail Blazers in a game that could affect their playoff ranking. The lessons from the past are still fresh in the minds of many, making it difficult for me to remain optimistic about the team's start to the season. 

 In fact, the high number of unforced turnovers in the first week also somewhat proves this view. 

 However, the fact that only 31% of turnovers occurred in the first quarter also indicates that the Wolves have made significant progress in refocusing on the game. 

 After the problem of excessive ball-sticking in the first away game, the Wolves showed significant improvement in their half-court offense, and the increased number of passes in the frontcourt also shows their patience in finding open shots. 

 Ant's farewell to the inefficient and predictable attack method of pushing the ball past half-court alone, when Conley is on the court, he usually positions himself in the corners on both sides and uses off-ball screens or DHO to create a time gap to make a decision, maximizing the effectiveness of the twin towers. This also allows Ant to calmly observe the situation on the court, and with improved passing skills compared to the first week, the Wolves' overall half-court offense has improved significantly. Please continue reading. However, this also brings out another concern-when Ant is not on the court, the team lacks a weapon that can create threats without the ball, making the ball flow but unable to truly tear the defense apart and create open shots. Big-Mac, who has the ability to handle the ball, also lacks enough passing skills, resulting in the team being stagnant. Another reason must be attributed to KAT's continued poor performance. Although he created many attacking tactics for the former leader in the two games against the Pelicans and the Spurs, Towns' overly predictable ending method also made it difficult for him to cut in when facing a crowded space with the twin towers, either being double-teamed or being disrupted by hurried offenses. From a statistical point of view, among players who cut in more than 7 times per game, KAT has the lowest assist rate in the league at 10%, and the second-highest turnover rate at 13.3%, only slightly better than rookie Henderson. Compared to his peak season in 21-22 (assist rate 24.6%; turnover rate 8.9%), the difference is huge. In short, as long as the Wolves' opponents are sure that KAT will not shoot from the outside and will not be fooled by his three-point fakes, their defensive strategy is to give enough physical confrontation to prevent him from cutting in a crowded space with the twin towers, resulting in either being double-teamed or making fouls due to impatience. When NAW, Big-Mac and others gradually regain their form, I believe that the goal for KAT should be to return to his 2020-21 self. By reducing his cutting-in percentage in the long-term twin towers, increasing the number of outside shots he is good at, it is the most effective way to create space on offense. However, how to achieve a balance on both ends of the court, and how to give up the playing style that allowed himself to rank among the top three teams in the league in 21-22, is a difficult task for the transformed KAT. Important defensive data: rebound rate: 50.5%, ranked 16th in the league. Transition defense: 19.9 possessions (ranked 12th in the league) / 1.13 points per possession, ranked 19th in the league. Opp. Offensive rebounds: 11.5, ranked 15th in the league. The Wolves maintain their "Match Up" defense strategy and won a tough battle against the Celtics with high-intensity physical collisions. Instead of returning to the Jazz's old self, Gobert has been reborn in Minnesota. With more abundant defensive resources than the Jazz, the French giant can try more diverse defensive strategies as long as he is healthy. Against the Celtics, he stepped out to defend the perimeter and let his teammates defend the paint, and against the Spurs, he tried zone defense. These all demonstrate the efforts of head coach Finch and assistant coach Turner to make the team's tactics more diverse. However, the zone defense and the defensive strategy that the Wolves have succeeded in this season have fundamentally different purposes and can only be used as a trick to disrupt the opponent's rhythm. Please continue reading. The decrease in focus mentioned on the offensive end is also reflected in the decrease in protection of long rebounds. Slo-Mo, NAW, Reid, and others have once again shown a lack of interest in fighting for rebounds. In addition, KAT's aggressiveness in returning to defense has also declined, but other players have shown improvement in executing assistant coach Corey Williams's principle of transitioning defense. The fact that they can maintain the same defensive mentality after nearly ten games shows that the Wolves can maintain their performance on the defensive end. Conclusion:
