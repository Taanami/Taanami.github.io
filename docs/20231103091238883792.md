Photo/Reuters Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard caused a stir in the offseason with his trade request, and there have been rumors that he only wants to go to the Heat. In a recent interview, he also talked about the issue of changing teams. The host asked directly, "I'll get straight to the point, will you stay with the Portland Trail Blazers for the upcoming season?" Lillard replied, "In a perfect world, I would spend my entire career in Portland."

When asked about his future with the Trail Blazers, Lillard said, "I have to live my life the way I think is right. For me, that's giving myself the best chance to win a championship, and the process of building it." "That's who I am. I will never be crushed by anything. I will sink with the ship, I'll do that. But that's just how I handle things. You can't make yourself look like an idiot. You say, 'I'm going to stay there and ride until the wheels fall off.' I don't need to prove to anyone, just like I've shown. My words are genuine." "But it's like you and me saying to each other, 'No matter what happens, we'll never betray each other.' Then one day, I still act according to the same principles. If we have the same goal, then we can continue. But when our goals are different, then you can't act like before. And that day has come, the goal you pursue is different from mine." When asked why he didn't consider joining his hometown team, the Warriors (Lillard is from the Bay Area), Lillard said, "About the Warriors, I respect everything they have done in the past eight or nine years. I come from there, obviously that's my hometown, but I can't be part of it." "They have indeed won four championships. I'll look like what, trying to say, 'Oh, I'm going to join my hometown team?' No. Someone plays the same position as me, and he (Curry) is the second best player in this era besides LeBron. For me, that just doesn't make sense. I would never do that. Before I go there, I'd rather lose every year." When asked about his thoughts on Kevin Durant joining the Warriors, Lillard said, "I've said it many times before, I think KD - obviously he's one of the greatest players of all time - but if I were in his position, I personally wouldn't do it. I just feel like that (Warriors) is the team they (Thunder) lost to. Before he left, they had already won a championship. I wouldn't do that. Everyone has their own situation - you have to do what you have to do."
