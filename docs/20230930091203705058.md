Yesterday's quarter-final match in the FIBA World Cup between Canada and Slovenia was marked by issues with the referees. In the fourth quarter, both Dillon Brooks and Luka Doncic received their second technical fouls of the game and were ejected.

During the post-game press conference, Doncic addressed the ejection, saying, "It was obvious that I was frustrated. Playing for the national team means a lot to me, and when we encounter problems on the court, I often struggle to control myself." Regarding the fairness of the referees' officiating, Doncic mentioned, "Even my teammates told me that the referees said, 'We won't blow the whistle for Brooks because he keeps approaching us.'" Doncic expressed his frustration about this perceived unfairness. He acknowledged his tendency to complain but still believed it was unfair for Canada to get physical while the referees didn't blow the whistle. 

Doncic also praised Brooks for his defense in yesterday's game, saying, "Brooks has always played this way, and I know many people don't like him, but I respect what he does on the court, and he does it very well." As for the key to Canada's victory yesterday, it wasn't just their strong defense but also the performance of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander on offense. Doncic said, "(SGA) is a difficult player to guard and one of the best players in the world."
