# Klay Thompson was asked why he didn't fold any paper airplanes after the game 
 Klay Thompson was asked why he didn't fold any paper airplanes after the game. "I played terribly, didn't deserve to fold any," he responded. Despite scoring the team's highest 9 points in the fourth quarter, Klay was still unsatisfied with his performance. 

Recently, Klay has been folding paper airplanes after games as a unique post-game "tradition". However, after losing to the Cavaliers for the second time in a week, he was asked why he didn't fold any today. 

"I played too poorly, didn't deserve to fold," Klay replied. He only scored 14 points today with a shooting percentage of 16 out of 5, and a netizen also shared a special statistic about the Warriors' first 10 games this season - besides Stephen Curry, no other player has scored more than 20 points in a game.
