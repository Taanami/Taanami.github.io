Facing strong opponents Japan in the quarterfinals, Lin Tingqian, Liu Zheng, and Abasi took charge of the backcourt and wings, while Zeng Xiangjun and Atino formed the frontline combination. With consecutive three-pointers from Lin Tingqian and Abasi, China started the game with a 10-2 lead.

The coaching staff of the Chinese team came well-prepared for this match, reducing Atino's low post receptions in the first half and focusing on offensive rebounds and pick-and-rolls.

In addition, everyone made efforts to strengthen defensive rebounds and create more opportunities for transition offense. Led by Lin Tingqian and Atino, the team took a 16-point lead with a score of 28-12 in the first quarter.

In the second quarter, Japan's shooting percentage remained low and they relied too much on isolation plays. Once again, Lin Tingqian stepped up and scored 9 points in the quarter, not only scoring himself but also organizing the team.

Lee Chi-wei, who came off the bench, contributed 5 points with a three-pointer and a fast break layup. At the end of the first half, Lin Tingqian had an impressive 17 points, helping China establish an 18-point lead with a score of 43-25.

Abasi effectively used his physical advantage to break through the half-court pressure and made good decisions in scoring and passing.

Zeng Wendong, the "Big Landlord," played a perfect role as a stabilizing force, showcasing his experience in high-level passing, rebound positioning, defensive positioning, and more. He had 7 assists, second only to Lin Tingqian. Lastly, the Chinese team demonstrated their best defensive focus and discipline since the preliminary round, trusting their teammates' abilities and executing the pre-game defensive strategy perfectly.
