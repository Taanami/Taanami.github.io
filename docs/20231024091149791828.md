  According to Adrian Wojnarowski, there has been no progress between Klay Thompson and the Warriors on contract negotiations, and there is a significant gap between the two sides in terms of contract length and amount. If Thompson cannot reach an agreement with the Warriors, he will become a completely free agent after the end of the season.

 Adrian Wojnarowski stated on the program, "I have been informed that there has been absolutely no progress between Klay Thompson and the Warriors on contract negotiations. There is still a gap between the two sides in terms of contract length and amount. Thompson is likely to enter the player's free market next summer without reaching a contract agreement."

 Thompson has helped the Warriors win four championships in the past and returned to the court in the 2021-2022 season after suffering major injuries (left ACL and Achilles tendon injuries) in 2019. Last season, Thompson played 69 games for the Warriors, averaging 21.9 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game with a three-point shooting percentage of 41.2%.
