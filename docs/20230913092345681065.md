 Introduction to Sakura Gakuen High School, the legendary successor in Japan's basketball scene.

In the 2021 FIBA Asia Cup Women's Basketball Tournament, Japan emerged as the champion by defeating China, securing their fifth consecutive title. They also made history by winning a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics. The remarkable success of Japanese basketball can be attributed to the comprehensive reforms introduced in the "Japan Sports Promotion Plan" since 2013. Whether it is in professional development or nurturing young talents, Japan has become a model worth emulating.

Among the invited teams for this year's Chao Yao Cup International Tournament, Sakura Gakuen High School stands out as an important breeding ground for Japan's new generation of female basketball players. Located in Aichi Prefecture, Sakura Gakuen High School is often referred to as the "Japanese national team factory". Established in 1980, this team has a rich history and has won an impressive 71 national championships, including the most championships in the current Japan Winter Cup (24 times) and the most championships in the Inter-High Basketball Tournament (25 times). They also hold the record for the highest score in a single game in the women's division of the Inter-High Basketball Tournament (139 points) and have achieved a five-year consecutive championship streak (1992-1996) in the National Sports Festival Basketball Competition for High School Division.

One of their famous achievements includes a legendary victory in the 2014 Inter-High Aichi Prefecture qualifying tournament, where they defeated Toyake High School with an astonishing score of "268:0". Sakura Gakuen High School's unique and innovative playing style, combining both Eastern and Western elements, has shattered the stereotype that Asian basketball players are physically disadvantaged. Not only have they consistently achieved great success in high school basketball, earning a dynasty-like status, but they have also produced many notable players who have made their mark in the international basketball scene. These include WNBA player Ramu Tokashiki from the Seattle Storm, main center players Maki Takada and Minaho Miyoshi, Japanese-Ghanaian sisters Evelyn and Stephanie Mawuli, and former WNBA player Tomoko Daidai who was recently announced as an inductee of the FIBA Hall of Fame. Maki Takada, a key member of the Japanese national team that won the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics, is also a graduate of Sakura Gakuen High School.

Sakura Gakuen High School has established a deep connection with Taiwan through previous exchanges, including their victory in the 2017 Grandmother's Cup and their participation in the 2018 Yangming Cup International Women's Basketball Invitational Tournament against Taipei Yangming High School. This year, they have once again come to Taiwan to participate in the Chao Yao Cup, bringing a roster that includes co-captains Kokoro Kurokawa and Mana Tanaka, as well as the "Asian prodigy" center player Rina Fukuwara. Additionally, four freshmen players, Nana Nagahamada, Mina Abe, Anzu Kanazawa, and Sakura Yamada, who were key players in the U16 Asian Youth Championship, where they defeated Taiwan's young female basketball players by a 47-point difference, are also part of their team.

With such an experienced and international lineup, it will be exciting to see what kind of "education" Sakura Gakuen will bring to Taiwanese female basketball players.

Sakura Gakuen High School, which has confirmed its participation in the Chao Yao Cup this year, has expressed their anticipation of participating in international competitions again after the pandemic. They look forward to observing and absorbing the strengths of various countries, and incorporating them to develop a more globally competitive "new Japanese style" of basketball.

As the current leader in domestic high school basketball, Sakura Gakuen aspires to become a cradle for student players with greater representation and influence in the international basketball community. This is undoubtedly an ambitious goal and a milestone they are working towards.
