  An Unsettled Off-Season for the Warriors and Season Outlook

The Warriors had a disappointing season last year, only making it to the second round of the playoffs. The team had high hopes of winning the championship, but various factors such as the atmosphere in the locker room, team injuries, and personal issues with Wiggins affected the team's cohesion.

The off-season for the Warriors has been anything but calm. They traded Jordan Poole, who had been with the team for four years, for Chris Paul, who plays the same position. They also drafted Brandin Podziemski from Santa Clara and signed Cory Joseph and Dario Saric in free agency.

Looking at the roster, it may seem like the team's strength hasn't changed much. However, as long as the three core players can perform at a normal level and maximize Chris Paul's abilities, the team can still remain competitive.

The biggest headache for Steve Kerr is how to manage the backup guards. Should CP3 start or come off the bench? It would be best if CP3 accepts coming off the bench. If he starts alongside Curry, the defense in the backcourt will suffer. Additionally, the Warriors' frontcourt already lacks height, and having Kevon Looney, who is 6'9", is not enough. If Green plays as a small-ball center, rebounding will be a challenge, and the team will lose its ability to control the paint.

Although in the past, Kerr has used a "Death Lineup" consisting of Curry, Poole, Thompson, Wiggins, and Green, which opened up the floor, it becomes ineffective if their shooting is off. The probability of grabbing offensive rebounds is low.

Furthermore, constantly asking players to play bigger roles can take a toll on their stamina. It would be better to have CP3 play with the second unit to maximize his value. Both Curry and Green need the ball to initiate the offense, so CP3's ball-handling opportunities will be significantly reduced. Although his usage rate has been decreasing over the years, it's not a good idea to have him play off-ball or as a catch-and-shoot player. In other words, his ball-handling percentage will increase when he plays with the second unit.

Another issue is CP3's style of play, which heavily relies on pick-and-rolls. The Warriors' system emphasizes setting screens and movement off the ball, so it may take some time for CP3 to adapt.

However, I disagree with this notion. In recent years, Curry and Draymond have started using more high pick-and-rolls to create space for Curry to drive or take pull-up shots. I believe Paul can continue to excel in pick-and-roll situations with the Warriors, and Kuminga may benefit from it as well. The key lies in how quickly Chris Paul can integrate into the system. Although his pick-and-roll effectiveness may have declined, he still possesses top-notch pick-and-roll skills that can create good scoring opportunities for himself. Considering Paul's successful pick-and-roll partnership with Ayton on the Suns, as long as Kuminga improves his screening quality, I am confident that Kuminga can thrive in this system.

Setting aside the perceived waste of having Chris Paul, who earns $30 million, come off the bench, I believe it's not a waste at all. For now, the focus should be on improving the lack of firepower in the second unit. I trust that CP3 can understand this.

Instead of chasing elusive consecutive starting records, it's better to increase the chances of winning a championship in his career. Last season, the Warriors had Donte DiVincenzo, who was capable of maintaining decent outside shooting. Therefore, I hope Brandin Podziemski, who has been selected, can contribute as a reliable shooter off the bench, with the condition that he improves on the defensive end.

Podziemski had an impressive college career at Santa Clara, shooting 43.8% from beyond the arc and averaging 2.5 three-pointers per game. Although Santa Clara's conference may not be the most competitive, achieving such a shooting percentage as the team's leading scorer is still remarkable.

Moreover, Podziemski's shooting is not limited to catch-and-shoot situations. He has shown the ability to navigate screens and move without the ball, making him a threat from long range. These skills can be amplified when playing with Green and Looney, who excel at setting screens.

In situations where Podziemski's shot isn't falling, he can use his playmaking abilities to create opportunities for his teammates. I believe he can provide a boost to the bench scoring, playing around 6-8 minutes per game, and be effective in executing tactics like Split Action and Flare Screen. GPII's role is also crucial in compensating for the poor defense in the backcourt. The regular rotation for the backcourt should look like this: Starting lineup: Curry+Thompson Bench: CP3+Podz+GPII (primarily playing the small forward position but also contributing to backcourt defense).

The team has also struggled with turnovers, averaging the highest number of turnovers per game in the league last season at 16.3. They have given away too many fast-break opportunities to opponents, making it difficult to prevent them from scoring. The team has essentially gifted opponents with a significant number of points from turnovers. These are the main reasons for the Warriors' turnovers.

Overall, the Warriors have made significant changes during the off-season, and there are still some challenges to overcome. However, with the right adjustments and integration of new players like Chris Paul and Brandin Podziemski, the team has the potential to be competitive and contend for a championship.
