Yesterday, the USA lost to Lithuania with a score of 104-110, suffering their first defeat of the World Cup. After the game, Bobby Portis of the USA team stated that the USA did not have the advantage in rebounds and could feel the difference without even looking at the statistics.

Regarding the loss in yesterday's game, Portis said, "It's painful, but we have to forget about it at midnight. One thing I've learned in sports is that no one will feel sorry for you, no one will pat your back and sleep with you, saying 'buddy, everything will be okay.' So we have to look forward and be ready for the next opponent." Speaking about the total rebounds of the entire USA team being 27, compared to Lithuania's 43 rebounds, Portis said, "They clearly have the advantage in rebounding, and I don't need to look at the statistics to see that. It's obvious." Portis played for 10 minutes yesterday, scoring 7 points, 5 rebounds, and 2 assists with a 3 out of 4 shooting percentage.
