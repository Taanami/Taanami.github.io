 Introduction to Fukushima Commercial High School's International Team for the Chang Yao Cup

When it comes to the Fukushima region in Japan, it is hard to escape the impression of a "city of tragedy." In the past, the area has experienced tragedies such as nuclear power accidents, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Despite the challenges faced in the overall industrial development of the region, the local citizens have always shown enthusiastic support for sports and its development. Starting with professional baseball, soccer, and basketball teams in the area, Fukushima is united in its hope to reshape the external perception through sports. Fukushima Commercial High School is a boys' basketball team that has emerged in such an environment and spirit.

In 2003, the basketball team of Fukushima Commercial High School was established, led by Coach Shinya Mizuno. Coach Mizuno, known for his defensive tactics leading to offensive organization, is not only the head coach of the Japan U18 High School Boys' Basketball Team, which is participating in the 31st China-Japan-Korea Youth Basketball Exchange Tournament organized by the sports associations of China, Japan, and Korea this year, but also led Fukushima Commercial High School to three appearances in the National High School Basketball Tournament between 2003 and 2013, achieving their best ranking of 32nd.

Coach Shinya Mizuno is the head coach of the Japan U19 Boys' Basketball Team this year. In 2021, Coach Mizuno returned to coach the boys' basketball team at Fukushima Commercial High School, bringing the team into a new era. Within a short period of just over three years, Fukushima Commercial High School has become a regular finalist in the High School Basketball Newcomer Championship and has successfully advanced to the final four this year. Despite not being able to strengthen their overall competitiveness through recruiting foreign players due to the system of public schools in Japan, the emphasis in today's Japanese basketball on cultivating more local players is highly valued and anticipated.

Fukushima Commercial High School actively challenges higher stages starting from local competitions. After completing their participation in the China-Japan-Korea Youth Exchange Tournament at the end of August, Coach Mizuno will lead the Fukushima Commercial High School boys' basketball team to Taiwan. For this team, which continues to challenge and grow, participating in the Chang Yao Cup is an important preparation for the Winter Cup in November. Coach Mizuno said, "Being able to compete and exchange with players of the same age from different countries is a very valuable opportunity for us." Through international competition, the players' perspectives and skills will be further expanded, and the future development of Fukushima Commercial High School holds great promise.
