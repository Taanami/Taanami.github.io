  PLG Ah Fei Joins Hsinchu Attack Lions to Return to the Professional Basketball Stage

Hsinchu Attack Lions basketball team announced today that Ah Fei, Shih Yen-Tsung, has officially joined the team and will wear the number one jersey in the upcoming season. Shih Yen-Tsung, 31 years old, became a free agent in July this year and received invitations for tryouts from various teams. In early September, he joined the Attack Lions for the Xiamen Professional Basketball Invitational Tournament. During the tournament, Shih Yen-Tsung showed great ambition, averaging double-digit points per game and serving as an effective communicator on the court. He played a crucial role in helping the Attack Lions win the championship, earning recognition from the coaching staff.

Head coach Lin Guan-Lun said, "Shih Yen-Tsung quickly adjusted and integrated into the team within a short period of time. He is also brave in communicating and leading his teammates. We hope that in the new season, he can take on more responsibilities in the power forward position and help the team demonstrate stronger team defense."

During the offseason, Shih Yen-Tsung maintained his physical condition through self-training. When asked about his mindset upon receiving the invitation from the Attack Lions, he admitted, "I didn't perform as well as I hoped in previous tryouts with other teams. This time, I made a special adjustment in my mindset. When I found out that I could join the team for the Xiamen tournament, I knew it would be my final exam. I had to treat every game as if it were my last. I'm glad that I was able to help my teammates and even contribute to the team's victories!" Shih Yen-Tsung has previously played for Taipei Dacin Tigers, Taoyuan Pauian Archiland, Taoyuan Pauian Leopards, and Changhua LK. Now entering his ninth year in his career, Shih Yen-Tsung believes that his mindset towards work has matured, especially after getting married. He hopes to contribute more to the team. "After joining the Attack Lions, as there are more young players on the team, I must be more willing to act as a bridge of communication, making the team operate more smoothly." After nearly three weeks of training, Shih Yen-Tsung has integrated well into the team system and has established positive chemistry with his teammates. "I feel that we are a young and energetic team. Not only are we willing to share the ball, but we also communicate and compensate for each other on the defensive end. I'm really looking forward to the new season and working together with my teammates to help the Attack Lions make it to the playoffs!"
