The Benefits Derrick Rose Brings to the Grizzlies Will Far Exceed Expectations

After the New York Knicks declined to exercise Derrick Rose's team option, he became a free agent and was heavily pursued by many teams. In the end, Rose chose to sign a two-year, $6.55 million contract with the Memphis Grizzlies, returning to where his college career began, in the small city of Memphis.

Derrick Rose's story is well-known to all basketball fans, and this article will not go into detail about it.

With constant injuries, it is no exaggeration to say that he has had a tumultuous career. He once carried the Chicago Bulls on his shoulders and became the youngest MVP in NBA history. But last season, despite finally being able to stay healthy with the Knicks, his former coach Tom Thibodeau chose to freeze him out. Please continue reading below. He only played 27 games last season, averaging just 12.5 minutes per game, almost half of his playing time in the previous season, and only played for 3 minutes in the playoffs.

"Not being able to play even though he can" is perhaps the most disheartening thing for Rose, and it was the main reason he decided to leave the Knicks after three seasons.

If Derrick Rose is considered the most storied player in the league, I believe most fans would agree. With his vast experience, he chose to join the young Grizzlies in the late stages of his career, a decision that seems reasonable but leaves me a bit puzzled. After all, at this stage in his career and with his current condition, competing for a championship with a team that has the potential to win it all would have been the top priority. It's not that the Grizzlies don't have the ability, but after struggling in the playoffs for two consecutive seasons, they still have a long way to go before they can claim their first championship in franchise history. The reason why Rose chose to join the Grizzlies is clear: he not only wants to lead this group of young players, but also wants to prove that he can still play. There have been examples of veterans who did not prioritize chasing a championship ring and chose to join teams with a large number of young players, maintaining a certain amount of playing time, like Vince Carter. In the later stages of his career, Carter played for the Grizzlies, Kings, and Hawks, all of which were not considered contenders at the time. However, having such a experienced veteran on the team can somewhat help the young players grow.

At the beginning of the season, Ja Morant's hot hands, combined with Desmond Bane's continued breakthroughs, maintained a certain level of competitiveness despite defensive flaws.

Jaren Jackson Jr., who returned from injury, immediately filled the defensive hole in the team upon his return, and the Grizzlies' defensive efficiency went from being at the bottom of the league to the top. This was also reflected in their record, as they climbed their way up and became the team in the Western Conference with the best chance to challenge the Nuggets. However, Ja Morant's gun incident broke out. According to sources, just before this incident, the team's oldest player, Steven Adams, had just hosted a meeting in the locker room with only the players, mostly reminding the young players to follow the rules, especially when playing away games.

But let's not forget that among this group of players with an average age of only 25, Adams was only 29 at the time. As the "big brother", his experience was perhaps a bit too limited. This incident revealed the problem that young teams often face when they lack a veteran leader.

Although Jaren Jackson Jr. had a career year and was selected as the Defensive Player of the Year, the Grizzlies' interior defense suffered a heavy blow after Adams was sidelined, and they were dominated by Anthony Davis in the playoffs.

Dillon Brooks, who has been with the Grizzlies the longest and should have been the team's leader, also caused the team to be labeled as "arrogant and conceited" due to his reckless behavior. On top of that, Morant's second gun incident followed, which was like a bucket of cold water being poured on fans' heads, and also forced management to take action. Please continue reading below. During the offseason, the Grizzlies let go of Dillon Brooks and traded for the more mature Marcus Smart, adding defensive strength and an "energy guy" role. With Derrick Rose's addition, not only can he fill the gap left by Morant's 25-game suspension at the start of the new season, but Rose's ranking as the fifth-best pick-and-roll player in the league, coupled with Adams' top-notch screening ability, will allow him to showcase his talents.

Moreover, most importantly, this group of young and energetic players needs a veteran like Rose to guide them and keep them from losing their way. "I'm not here to babysit or micromanage. I'm not here to be a plant in the locker room. I'm here to help guys win," Derrick Rose pointed out at the Grizzlies' media day, highlighting the problem that young players often face: they are unable to absorb advice from teammates of similar age. This is easily understandable, and coupled with the fact that all players who make it to the NBA must have a competitive spirit to survive in the league, it's even harder for them to listen to advice from someone of similar age. Therefore, Rose believes that there must be players with a certain age and experience to guide them, even though such players are becoming rarer in the league. Fortunately, the Grizzlies have welcomed Rose.

His addition will not only bring stability to the team's scoring firepower, but also guide the young players on the court and help them grow faster. With Rose on board, the future looks even brighter for the Memphis Grizzlies, and the benefits he brings will far exceed fans' expectations.
