  Canada's key player struggles with fouls in the World Cup, Serbia advances to the final for the second time since 2014

In the semifinals of the World Cup, Canada faced Serbia in a battle to advance to the championship. Canada was heavily affected by foul troubles throughout the game, handicapping their defense, while Serbia displayed excellent teamwork on offense, shooting over 70% from two-point range. In the end, Serbia defeated Canada 95-86, securing their spot in the championship game for the second time in consecutive World Cups.

The officiating in the first half was unfavorable for Canada, as their key players committed at least two fouls each (with the team totaling 17 fouls in the first half). This had a direct impact on the performance of their star player, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who only scored five points in the first half while accumulating three fouls.

On the other hand, Serbia showcased their strong offensive firepower and responded whenever Canada tried to narrow the gap. Canada's disadvantage in the paint was evident, with Serbia outscoring them 22-12 in the area. Bogdan Bogdanovic remained steady for Serbia, contributing 15 points in the first half and leading by 13 points at halftime.

In the second half, Dillon Brooks hit two consecutive three-pointers for Canada, but he quickly picked up his fourth foul and was substituted. Although Canada managed to score some points from outside the arc in this quarter, fouls continued to trouble them, and their efforts to catch up were not significant. At the end of the third quarter, Serbia's two crucial three-pointers extended their lead to 12 points.

In the final quarter, Serbia's offense flowed smoothly, leading by as much as 17 points. Canada had to call a timeout to regroup. After the timeout, Canada continued to fight back, but Serbia always found an answer to score and maintained a comfortable lead of at least ten points.

In the last three minutes, Canada made consecutive mistakes on offense, allowing the point difference to widen to over 15 points. The game was completely controlled by Serbia, who ultimately defeated Canada, advancing to the World Cup final once again since 2014. All players of Serbia performed exceptionally well in this game, with a two-point shooting percentage over 70% and a three-point shooting percentage of 45%. Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 23 points, along with 4 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals. Nikola Milutinov achieved a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds, Ognjen Dobric contributed 16 points, and Marko Guduric added 12 points. Canada struggled with foul troubles, allowing Serbia to dominate their offensive end. RJ Barrett scored the highest for Canada with 23 points, while SGA contributed 15 points and 9 assists, Dillon Brooks had 16 points, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker scored 10 points.
