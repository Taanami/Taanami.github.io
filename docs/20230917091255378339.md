  Germany defeats Serbia in the second half to claim their first World Cup title

After 91 games, the final championship game of the FIBA World Cup has arrived, featuring two of the best European teams of the tournament, Germany and Serbia. The first half ended in a tie, with both teams finding ways to counter each other's attacks. Towards the end of the third quarter, Serbia faced a setback, allowing Germany to pull ahead by 12 points. In the fourth quarter, Serbia made a valiant effort to come back, but ultimately fell short. Germany emerged victorious with a score of 83-77, securing their first-ever World Cup championship.

Both teams showcased their preferred offensive strategies, with a focus on half-court plays. Serbia utilized more empty-hand drives, while Germany relied on better team coordination. In the first quarter, there were six lead changes and four ties, with Serbia narrowly leading by 3 points (26-23).

Unfortunately for Serbia, their starter Ognjen Dobric had to leave the game early due to an ankle injury. In the second quarter, both teams continued to battle fiercely. Germany relied on the individual scoring abilities of NBA players Franz Wagner and Dennis Schroder, while Bogdan Bogdanovic of Serbia had another impressive performance in the first half, scoring 15 points. The score remained tied at 47 points each as they entered the second half.

In the second half, the defensive intensity increased, and Serbia struggled with offensive turnovers. Within the first six minutes of the third quarter, Serbia only managed to score 6 points. After a turbulent period, Germany extended their lead to an 11-point difference, forcing Serbia to call a timeout. The Wagner brothers made significant contributions, with Franz Wagner scoring a three-pointer from the arc, and Moritz Wagner receiving an assist under the basket, widening the score difference to 12 points.

In the final quarter, Serbia launched a comeback effort, with Aleksa Avramovic and Filip Petrusev scoring consecutively. Germany called a timeout as Avramovic continued to score five more points. Fortunately, Johannes Voigtmann of Germany stopped the bleeding with a corner three-pointer. In the last two minutes, after a timeout called by Serbia, Avramovic once again stepped up for his team, hitting a three-pointer and drawing a foul beyond the three-point line. The 9-point difference before the timeout quickly shrank to just 3 points. In a crucial moment, Germany called a timeout but then committed a turnover on offense, and Marko Guduric missed a three-pointer that could have tied the game.

In Germany's counterattack, Serbia committed a foul, and Schroder made one of two free throws. In the next possession, Guduric attempted an offensive play but failed to draw a foul. He only made both free throws from the foul. With 21.4 seconds left, Schroder created space and successfully scored, extending the lead to four points. In the following possession, Guduric made a fatal mistake, sealing Serbia's defeat. Germany emerged as the victors, claiming their first-ever national championship title.
