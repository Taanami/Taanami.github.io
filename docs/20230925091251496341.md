 Serbian player Borisa Simanic discusses his kidney injury and the recovery process. A few weeks ago during the group stage of the FIBA World Cup, Simanic lost his kidney due to an elbow hit and the local medical environment. In a recent interview, he talked about the situation at the time and his current recovery.

Firstly, he mentioned the process of handling the situation when it happened. Simanic said, "Although initially everything seemed to progress smoothly, I faced serious complications and had to have one kidney removed. It felt strange at first, but now the situation is improving. I can start walking and eating, hoping for a quick recovery."

Simanic's injury was not light, as he had to undergo two kidney removal surgeries. Initially, complications persisted because the remaining kidney function was abnormal. Reflecting on the situation, Simanic said, "After the two surgeries, there were five days where I had no idea what was happening outside, not even a phone. When I finally got my phone after the first surgery, I sent a message to the Serbian national team, boosting their morale. Their victories meant a lot to me. In this regard, we support each other."

He could only follow the subsequent games through his phone. The report also revealed his current condition, stating that he needs to rest for three months without doing anything. At least until December, he won't know what the future holds.

Simanic said, "This time is for my kidney to rest and heal completely. After this period, further examinations and tests will be conducted, and then we will know if I can continue playing."
