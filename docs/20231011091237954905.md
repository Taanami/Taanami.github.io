  PLG Lions respond to Taishin Bank's continued lies and promise to provide evidence

Regarding the press conference held earlier by the Taishin Bank team, the PLG Lions team will reiterate the following four key points, as stated in the official statement:

1. The PLG Lions respected the regulations of the previous team during the contract negotiations with Lin Ping-Sheng. The representatives of the PLG Lions team added a note in the contract, specifically in Article 3, Clause 5, stating that "if the original team matches the offer within one month after the signing of this contract, the contract will not be effective." This clause was intended to protect the original team's priority matching rights. Under the free competition in the two leagues, there was no malicious poaching by the PLG Lions. Furthermore, the original team did not issue any statement accusing the PLG Lions of malicious poaching. It is believed that the fans and the Taiwanese society can judge the situation for themselves.

2. Lin Ping-Sheng's signing was completely voluntary. When Lin Ping-Sheng personally signed the contract, he was accompanied by friends and family at the Starbucks in Beitou. There were also many customers and staff present at the scene. How can an adult, signing a contract in broad daylight with the company of friends and family, not take responsibility for his own signature? Furthermore, the claim made by Head Coach Shang Jui-Chiang at the press conference about coercion to sign is unfounded.

3. Lin Ping-Sheng continued to negotiate contract details with the PLG Lions after June 28th. Lin Ping-Sheng falsely claimed at the Taishin Bank press conference that he had expressed his decision not to join the PLG Lions to the team representatives from June 28th to August 14th. However, in reality, he continued to privately negotiate with the PLG Lions representatives between August 8th and August 14th regarding "CBA overseas clause, personal incentive bonuses, Hsinchu rental subsidies, training expense subsidies, jersey numbers," and other matters. The screenshots released can clearly refute the lies of the Taishin Bank press conference.

4. Taishin Bank team does not respect the consensus reached in the coordination meeting of the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association. The Chinese Taipei Basketball Association issued a statement after the mediation meeting on September 4th: "Although there is no conclusion reached in this mediation meeting, we hope to propose negotiation conditions on the premise of mutual benefit. After the representatives of both sides report the content of the mediation meeting to the headquarters, a decision will be made on whether to hold a second mediation meeting based on the subsequent situation." On September 5th, the PLG Lions received a reply from the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association, in which the Taishin Bank team only agreed to negotiate with Lin Ping-Sheng. This response goes against the consensus of the mediation meeting between the two teams. Finally, the Hsinchu PLG Lions emphasize once again, since legal action has already been taken, has Lin Ping-Sheng breached the contract? Has Taishin Bank engaged in malicious poaching? Let the court, Fair Trade Commission, and all fans in Taiwan be the judge! If Taishin Bank continues to distort the truth and openly lie, the PLG Lions will continue to provide evidence, and we will employ more means to defend the rights of the PLG Lions fans and team. Please stay tuned!
