The Chinese men's basketball team, which made it to the top 4 in the previous Asian Games, arrived in Hangzhou yesterday. Head coach, Sam Mitchell, stated that all players are in good health and despite being in the same group as the host country, China, their aim is to finish first in the group.

The Chinese team was initially placed in Group B along with the host country, Lebanon, and Mongolia for the preliminary round. Finishing first in the group would secure a direct qualification to the quarterfinals, while the second and third teams in the group would face each other for a chance to advance to the quarterfinals. Lebanon recently withdrew and was replaced by Hong Kong, who will be the opponent for the Chinese team's opening match on the 26th. Mitchell mentioned that although the first opponent has changed from Lebanon to Hong Kong, with a completely different playing style, the intensity of the competition is still at the Asian Games level. Therefore, the team needs to approach each game with a normal mindset. Their second match will be against China, and the third against Mongolia, with the goal of advancing as the top team in the group.

The main concern for the Chinese team in their quest for first place is the eligibility of naturalized player, Ateno. Mitchell said, "Currently, we heard that the team management will make the final confirmation at the team leaders' meeting. Yesterday, we inquired with the team headquarters but didn't receive any news. It feels like he can play, but we still need to wait for the team leaders' meeting for confirmation."

The Chinese team has also made contingency plans in case Ateno is unable to play. In addition to Li Dewei, who usually plays as a center, power forward Zeng Wendong, who usually plays as the number four, will also take on a crucial role. However, currently, Ateno is still part of the team's starting lineup preparation, and it is expected that he will play alongside Lin Tingqian, Liu Zheng, and Zeng Wendong. The small forward position, number three, will be either Li Qiwei or Lu Junxiang, with "Black Panther" Abasi playing as the sixth man. Mitchell mentioned that they hope Abasi can play as the best sixth man because he can easily change the course of the game and contribute a lot of scoring power when on the court. Abasi is expected to be in the sixth man position about 90% of the time. The final decision for the starting lineup will be between Li Qiwei and Lu Junxiang, with a slight inclination towards Lu Junxiang because he can share the workload of Lin Tingqian as a guard and alleviate his pressure.
