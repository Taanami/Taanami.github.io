  20232024 Season Analysis: Boston Celtics' Countdown to a New Beginning

Since the arrival of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, the Boston Celtics have reached the Eastern Conference Finals four times in six years, but have only made it to the NBA Finals once.

Although their playoff record may suggest intense battles with the top teams in the East, a closer look reveals that this young team still struggles with inconsistency, often allowing seemingly easy wins to slip away and even facing the brink of elimination before focusing on both ends of the court. Reports of communication issues between players and coaches surfaced again at the end of last season, causing this talented and deep team to once again fall short due to locker room problems.

However, after a busy offseason of management and coaching changes, the Celtics have emerged as a dominant force in the East once again. So what can we expect from this team in the upcoming season? Joe Mazzulla's re-challenge as head coach Despite being thrown into the position last season, Mazzulla led the team to their best performance since the "Big 3" era. Although his in-game adjustments and decisions were questioned by many, it's important to remember that he is still a relatively inexperienced head coach.

With the trust of the management and a revamped coaching staff that includes former Bucks assistant coach Charles Lee and 76ers assistant coach Sam Cassell, Mazzulla will have the support of two experienced assistant coaches to help address the team's locker room and player management issues.

Despite losing defensive stalwarts Marcus Smart and Robert Williams in the offseason, under Brad Stevens' management, the additions of Kristaps Porziņģis and Jrue Holiday not only maintained the team's defensive strength, but also raised their offensive potential. Preseason games have also shown a different offensive strategy compared to last season. However, with four players on the team who had a usage rate of over 25% last season, Mazzulla will have to carefully manage and distribute the ball.

Key player to watch this season: Payton Pritchard Despite having a disappointing season last year and even expressing his desire to be traded, Pritchard remained on the team and even signed a 4-year, $30 million extension. Some fans may think he's just another undersized shooting guard, but in preseason games, Pritchard has shown that he's more than just a shooter. He has solid ball-handling skills, can create space for himself and his teammates with pick-and-rolls, and even uses advanced techniques like the hostage dribble to set up easy shots for his big men. It will be interesting to see if he can continue this level of play against tougher defenses in the regular season.

Another advantage of Pritchard is his ability to adapt to both on-ball and off-ball roles. With a less crowded backcourt this season after the departure of sixth man Malcolm Brogdon, Pritchard will have the opportunity to play consistent minutes and potentially have a breakout season.

Key word for the Celtics this season: Clutch Time Looking at the numbers, the Celtics had a 24-13 record in 37 clutch time games last season, a decent winning percentage. However, they also had a significant drop in performance after the All-Star break and blew several double-digit leads, causing some fans to view them as an inconsistent team. While Tatum and Brown have shown flashes of clutch performances in regular season games, they have yet to prove themselves as leaders in high-pressure playoff situations.

The Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler in last season's playoffs are a good example of how to win in clutch time. With a strong starting lineup, the Celtics' main focus this season will be maintaining their lead when they have it. As for who will take the last shot in clutch situations, with a deep roster and a new coaching staff, it's unlikely that Mazzulla will only design "On The Run" plays for Tatum. 

Potential concern this season: Resting and injury management With the league's stricter Player Participation Policy (PPP), teams are no longer allowed to rest more than two star players at a time. This will be a challenge for the Celtics, as Tatum and Brown have been among the league leaders in minutes played in recent seasons. With the introduction of mid-season tournaments, players will also need to play at least 20 minutes to be eligible for individual awards. This may be a concern for Tatum and Brown, who have shouldered a heavy workload in recent years, and will also test the coaching staff's ability to integrate the team and reduce their usage in the regular season.
