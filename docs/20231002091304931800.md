 Bronny James and Shareef O'Neal both live in the shadow of their famous fathers and face heart problems.

Article: Yesterday, Bronny James, the eldest son of LeBron James, suddenly collapsed while practicing and experienced a momentary cardiac arrest. Fortunately, he was promptly rushed to the hospital and is now out of intensive care. However, this collapse may jeopardize all the efforts he has made so far.

As the son of LeBron, Bronny has had to face greater attention and pressure than other "basketball second-generation" players. After all, he is not just the son of a player, but the son of a basketball legend with a historical position in the NBA. Naturally, his basketball talent would be scrutinized more closely. However, compared to his father's high school years, Bronny's dominance is not as impressive as LeBron's. Although he still has good innate abilities, he has not displayed the same level of dominance in high school basketball as his father did. At one point, he was even considered a "chip off the old block." But despite the unfriendly criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continued to improve his skills. In his senior season, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, and was selected to the McDonald's All-American High School Basketball Team. He was given the title of a five-star high school player by some basketball media and received basketball scholarships from some NCAA Division I schools.

These achievements have significantly boosted Bronny's draft prediction, going from a possibility of not being selected to having the chance to compete for a first-round or even lottery pick.

Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father LeBron's fame. LeBron has also mentioned that if Bronny enters the NBA, he has a high chance of joining his son's team to play together.

This "selecting son to send father" move undoubtedly has an impact on Bronny's market value, but we must not ignore Bronny's own efforts. He ultimately chose the University of Southern California and plans to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. Before enrolling, he posted on his social media, expressing his determination to prove the doubters wrong.

However, the heart problem that arises before the start of the new college season casts a shadow over his future. If his NBA path is hindered by heart issues, it reminds me of another "basketball second-generation" player, Shareef O'Neal, the son of basketball star "The Big Shaq" Shaquille O'Neal.

During his high school years, Shareef did achieve some notable results and was recognized as a four-star high school player by sports media. He was also planning to enter the NBA after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, he was diagnosed with a heart abnormality that posed a high risk to his life and required emergency surgery. The post-surgery rest and rehabilitation forced Shareef to be away from high-intensity games for a whole 11 months, which was a setback for a rising player.

Losing a year during the crucial development period can significantly impact one's skills and competitiveness. With Shareef's condition, he was no longer a dominant force in the more intense NCAA games. Coaches in college were also cautious due to the risk of relapse and the consideration of team performance. This led to a decline in his college performance, and ultimately, he faced the fate of not being drafted.

"I always tell Shareef that he will never be the next me." "I want him to play his own game, his own style." "Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the name O'Neal, but he still needs to create his own path." "At that time, I had the pressure to succeed because I needed to improve my life." "But Shareef doesn't have that pressure, so I hope he can find his own goals." Currently, Shareef is still developing in the league, waiting for opportunities. Despite averaging only 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the last season, overcoming the shadow of his heart problem is still a significant progress. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be tied down by his father's achievements and reputation but to bravely pursue his own chosen path. I believe LeBron sees Bronny in the same way, that regardless of the impact on his draft position, it will not affect LeBron's love for his child. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by injuries and will showcase his worth in the upcoming season. This article is published with permission from the author.
