 202324 Key Player: Keegan Murray of the Sacramento Kings

Recap of the 2022-23 Rookie Season: Keegan Murray broke Donovan Mitchell's record for most three-pointers made by a rookie in a single season (206), surpassing the previous record of 187 set in the 2017-18 season. What's remarkable is that he achieved this record with an impressive 41.1% three-point shooting percentage, proving himself to be a quality shooter. This success can be attributed to the Kings' tactical system and offensive configuration that emphasizes speed, space, and the support of teammates like Domantas Sabonis and De'Aaron Fox.

According to BBall-Index, among the top 10% of players who played over 1,000 minutes and ranked in three-point percentage and made shots, only Joe Harris, Jevon Carter, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Malcolm Brogdon had better three-point shot quality than Keegan. Behind his high shooting percentage, in addition to his excellent shooting touch, credit should be given to the favorable shooting environment provided by the team. Despite the Kings' first playoff appearance in 16 years, they faced a tough opponent, the defending champion Golden State Warriors, and in the high-pressure and intense defensive series, rookie Keegan Murray had limited contributions in the first three games, averaging only 3.3 points and 4 rebounds. However, unexpectedly, Keegan showed his evolution in the following games and helped the team extend the series to a seventh game.

Continuing with the regular season, where Keegan only averaged 4.6 rebounds, he showcased his rebounding ability in the next four games. Not only did he average 8 rebounds per game, but he also improved his scoring performance, scoring double digits in all four games with an average of 14.5 points. Although the Kings ultimately lost the series, Keegan's presence in the later games of the playoffs raised expectations among the coaching staff and fans for his performance in the upcoming season.

Visible Transformation: Every summer is a turning point for NBA players' transformations, and last summer, Fox, who had just gotten married, continued to train hard even during his honeymoon. This allowed him to have a breakout season in the 22-23 season. As Keegan enters his first offseason, he has not been idle. He has been training alongside Fox and even taking on the role of a mentor.

This has sparked even greater anticipation for Keegan's offseason development under the guidance of Fox, similar to the evolution seen in Fox's previous season. Keegan mentioned in an interview that they have had multiple one-on-one matchups during their offseason training. For Keegan, who showed limited individual offensive abilities during his rookie season, this is undoubtedly a great opportunity for him to hone his skills. Although Keegan humbly admitted that he has not won a single game against Fox during their training sessions, fans have already seen what they wanted to see during the California Classic hosted by the Kings.

Although Keegan had an extremely efficient performance in perimeter shooting and catch-and-shoot three-pointers last season, with a remarkable 97.6% of his three-pointers being assisted, there were doubts about his ability to develop self-created offense at the NBA level. While sharpshooters with high-quality shooting skills have a place in the modern NBA that emphasizes space, developing the ability to create their own offense and generate space would elevate Keegan's offensive impact. Keegan indeed responded to everyone's expectations during the California Classic. In the first game against the Golden State Warriors, he scored a game-high 29 points. Shortly after the start of the game, he showcased his ball-handling and driving ability, finishing with a one-handed dunk that ignited the Kings fans in attendance. Even teammates Malik Monk and Davion Mitchell on the sidelines were amazed because they knew firsthand that Keegan didn't have these types of plays where he brought the ball up the court and performed coast-to-coast dunks throughout the previous year.
