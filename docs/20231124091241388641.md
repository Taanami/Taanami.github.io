 Virtus Segafredo Bologna, one of the top teams in the Italian Basketball League (LBA), recently announced the dismissal of their head coach, Sergio Scariolo (also the current head coach of Spain), and the hiring of Luca Banchi (current head coach of Latvia) as his replacement. This decision has caused quite a stir before the start of the new season.

The timing of Scariolo's dismissal was surprising, as his relationship with the team has been strained for a long time, with reports of external interference during games. He was also considered a top candidate for the head coaching position of the Toronto Raptors, and even had a video conference with the team while coaching Virtus Bologna in the Italian league finals. The breaking point came when the team's budget was reduced due to the implementation of financial fair play policies in European leagues, forcing Virtus Bologna to let go of several players whose contracts had expired.

During a press conference on Wednesday (September 13), Scariolo's words sparked a lot of discussion. He stated that the team's roster decisions were mostly made by the club and refused to answer questions about the team's goals for the new season, suggesting that people should ask the management instead.

However, these remarks did not sit well with the majority of the shareholders of Virtus Bologna, leading to the decision to dismiss Scariolo. According to inside sources, almost everyone within the club was in favor of his dismissal. On Friday morning, Virtus Bologna released a statement announcing Scariolo's termination.

The statement also pointed out that Scariolo's remarks to the media on September 13, as well as his statements during a press conference on June 27 after the end of the season, were major reasons for his dismissal.

Following Scariolo's dismissal, Virtus Bologna quickly announced that they had reached an agreement with Luca Banchi to become the new head coach, signing a two-year contract. Banchi has previously coached multiple teams, including Siena and EA7 Emporio Armani Milan. He also led Latvia to a fifth-place finish at the World Cup this year, earning him the award for Best Coach at the tournament. Interestingly, Banchi's Latvia team had faced Scariolo's Spain in the World Cup, with Latvia ultimately emerging victorious and preventing Spain from advancing to the quarter-finals. This unexpected coaching change in European basketball has sparked widespread discussion among the public.
