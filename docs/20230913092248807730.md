 The players of the East Super Bay Winged Dragons collectively issued a statement accusing the team and stating that they will seek legal avenues to defend their rights.

Yesterday, the East Super team, Bay Winged Dragons, officially announced their dissolution. The main reason behind this decision is the conflict of interest between the East Super management and stakeholders in operating the league and owning the team. The team had initially stated that they would provide a satisfactory termination agreement for all team members. However, late at night, players such as Zhu Songwei refuted the claims made by East Super on Weibo.

Players Liu Chuanxing, Zhu Songwei, Ju Mingxin, Zheng Qilong, Adili Kurban, and Wang Yunzhang jointly released a statement on Weibo. According to a further report by the South China Morning Post, it provided additional details regarding the actual dissolution of the Bay Winged Dragons.
