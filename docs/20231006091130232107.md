 NBA admits bad spending habits, JR Smith says the money he was fined could have been used for 10 community service projects.

NBA players earn a lot of salary, and their spending habits have been scrutinized by the public. Recently, former NBA player JR Smith admitted on the "I AM ATHLETE" podcast that his spending habits were quite bad and that unnecessary expenses could have been avoided.

On the show, JR Smith said, "In the past, I would be late for the bus, and the money I was fined could have been used for more than 10 community service projects. Even in nightlife, we would rather spend $60,000 in a nightclub for one night than use that money to feed 2,500 people." JR Smith earned a total of $91.48 million in his 16-season NBA career. Although this money was not a burden for him, it is evident that JR's demeanor and behavior have changed after his playing career ended. He decided to go to college and his speech and conduct have improved. He even achieved a GPA of 4.0 and was selected as the North Carolina A&T Athlete of the Year.
