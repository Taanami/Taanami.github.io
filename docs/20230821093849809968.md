 The NBA Spurs have won the first overall pick in the draft lottery and are expected to select the highly-touted French prospect, Victor Wembanyama. If they successfully sign him, it will be the third time in franchise history that they acquire a game-changing big man. The lottery is open to the 14 teams that did not make the playoffs this season. The Detroit Pistons, Houston Rockets, and San Antonio Spurs, who had the worst regular season records, had the highest chance of winning the first overall pick at 14.0% each. Represented by team executive Peter J. Holt, the Spurs secured the first pick, while the Charlotte Hornets and Portland Trail Blazers won the second and third picks respectively. The fourth pick belongs to the Rockets.

The Spurs, with the first overall pick, are likely to select one of the most highly anticipated rookies in NBA history, the 19-year-old French center, Victor Wembanyama, who stands at 7 feet 3 inches (221 cm) tall. It is expected that he will have an immediate impact in the NBA.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, "He is an incredible young man, only 19 years old, but clearly a generational talent." This is the Spurs' third time winning the draft lottery. The previous two times they selected players with the first pick, it proved to be a fruitful decision for the team.

In 1987, the Spurs selected "The Admiral" David Robinson, and in 1997, they picked "The Big Fundamental" Tim Duncan. Both players were instrumental in helping the team win five championships under current head coach Gregg Popovich.

The Spurs finished the season with a record of 22 wins and 60 losses, tying for the second-worst record in the league. Popovich has had great success in the past with international players such as Manu Ginobili from Argentina and Tony Parker from France. Now, he has the opportunity to build a new "Spurs dynasty" with Wembanyama.

The teams that secured the fifth to fourteenth picks are the Detroit Pistons, Orlando Magic, Indiana Pacers, Washington Wizards, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks, Orlando Magic (again), Oklahoma City Thunder, Toronto Raptors, and New Orleans Pelicans.
