  Three Arrows of Chinese Basketball Team Join Forces to Beat Kazakhstan and Secure Quarter-Final Ticket

October 2, 2023, Hangzhou - Special correspondent Zeng Siju reports for United Daily News: Chinese team's Abasi, nicknamed "Black Panther", played a crucial role in their victory against Kazakhstan in the key match for securing a spot in the quarter-finals of the 2023 Hangzhou Asian Games.

With the joint efforts of Liu Zheng, Lin Tingqian, and "Black Panther" Abasi as the three scoring arrows, Chinese men's basketball team dominated the game with a 26-point lead in the first half. Lin Tingqian's 11 points in the third quarter helped the team maintain their lead and ultimately secured a 83-62 victory over Kazakhstan. With a total of 16 teams participating in the Asian Games men's basketball tournament, Chinese team's loss to the host country China in the preliminaries was followed by a close win against Mongolia, securing the second spot in Group B. In today's quarter-final qualification match against Group A's third-place team Kazakhstan, only the winning team could advance to the final eight.

Chinese team started strong with a 11-2 lead, with Liu Zheng contributing 6 points. Following that, the team continued to score with Atino and Abasi making free throws, and Abasi scoring another 6 points to widen the lead to 16-5.

Abasi's 8 points in the first quarter helped Chinese team take a 20-11 lead. Lu Junxiang's three-pointer in the second quarter was met with a heated response from Kazakhstan's outside shooters, narrowing the gap to 17-23. However, Chinese team's Liu Zheng hit two consecutive three-pointers, while Abasi also scored from the outside, and Atino made a basket, extending the lead to 37-22. By halftime, Chinese team had a comfortable lead of 44-26.

In the first half, Liu Zheng scored 12 points and Abasi scored 14 points, with both making 2 out of 4 three-pointers, which was equivalent to Kazakhstan's total score. After Atino completed a "three-point play" in the third quarter, Lin Tingqian scored a high lob, and Chinese team's lead widened to 51-30. Four minutes later, Lin Tingqian and Abasi once again performed an "air relay", where Abasi was supposed to make a dunk, but due to defensive pressure, he only managed to put the ball in the basket, causing a stir among the fans at the Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium. The unfinished dunk show by Abasi was completed in the next Chinese team's attack by Zeng Xiangjun, who received a floor pass from Lin Tingqian and made a two-handed dunk, extending Chinese team's lead to 57-35 and forcing Kazakhstan to call a timeout. However, the timeout did not cool down Lin Tingqian's hot hands, as he scored 11 points in the quarter. Together with Zeng Xiangjun's two-handed dunk, Chinese team entered the final quarter with a 66-44 lead. In the fourth quarter, Li Qiwei added a three-pointer, and Lu Junxiang made a sneaky basket, further widening the lead for Chinese team, ultimately winning with a score of 83-62.

Lin Tingqian scored 19 points today, while Abasi and Liu Zheng each scored 18 and 12 points, respectively. All three players were rested after the third quarter.

With a successful qualification to the quarter-finals, Chinese team will face Group D leader Japan tomorrow night at 8pm. The winner will advance to the final four, while the losing team will have to compete for a ranking between 5th and 8th place.
