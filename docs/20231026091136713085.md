 According to Yahoo reporters Jake Fischer and Adrian Wojnarowski, the Portland Trail Blazers are considering acquiring Deandre Ayton from the Phoenix Suns in a potential trade involving Damian Lillard. However, the Miami Heat are not currently involved in discussions for Lillard.

Fischer reports that the trade for Lillard could involve multiple teams, with the Chicago Bulls and Toronto Raptors also interested in acquiring him. Other teams, including the Suns, Jazz, Hornets, and Nets, have also been mentioned as potential trade partners. The Blazers are seriously considering acquiring Ayton as part of a package for Lillard.

Fischer states, "According to my sources, the Blazers are strongly considering acquiring Ayton as part of a package for Lillard, and this has been reported by local Phoenix media outlets Arizona Sport and PHNX." However, Fischer also notes that the difficulty in acquiring Ayton is not what the Blazers can offer for Lillard, but rather the fact that they would also have to part ways with Jusuf Nurkic. Additionally, the Suns' new head coach Frank Vogel may require a center to execute his tactical plans.

The Raptors are reportedly considering sending Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby, and other young players in a potential trade, but their remaining contracts of 1 and 2 years, respectively, may be a concern for the Blazers, who also have Jerami Grant on a newly signed big contract playing the same position. The Bulls have been trying to trade Zach LaVine this summer, but have found no buyers, and the Blazers have young players such as Scoot Henderson, Shaedon Sharpe, and Anfernee Simons that they want to develop, leaving little room for LaVine.

Finally, the Jazz, Nets, Hornets, and Bulls have also been mentioned as potential trade partners, with Fischer reporting that the Heat are still involved in discussions and Tyler Herro is a player they would be willing to trade in a potential deal. However, Wojnarowski notes on his show that while there have been reports of progress, no deal is imminent, and there are multiple teams vying for Lillard's services. The Blazers are actively working on a trade and hope to complete it before training camp. As of now, the reason for no further progress in the talks is that the Heat are not involved, but as we all know, one move can change the entire dynamic of a trade.
