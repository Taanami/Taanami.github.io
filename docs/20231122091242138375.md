NBA Player Dwight Howard Accused of Sexual Assault and Illegal Detention by Man, Denies Allegations and Requests Dismissal This Week

Dwight Howard, a player for the NBA, was accused of sexual assault and illegal detention by a man named Stephen Harper from Georgia. Harper filed a civil lawsuit in July, claiming that Howard and another man sexually assaulted and detained him, as well as intentionally causing mental distress.

This week, Howard denied these allegations through his lawyer and requested for the court to dismiss the case and make a summary judgment, with the lawsuit and lawyer fees to be paid by Harper.

According to Harper's lawyer, Harper and Howard met on Instagram and exchanged explicit messages. They agreed to meet at Howard's home in Gwinnett County on July 19, 2021. However, on the way to Howard's residence, Howard asked if another man or woman could join them, to which Harper replied that he was not interested. Despite this, when Harper arrived at Howard's place, he found another man dressed as a woman, who identified as "Kitty", present. Harper claims he tried to resist, but was forced by Howard and the other man to engage in sexual activity.

Harper stated that he was afraid of being harmed if he continued to refuse. He felt violated, humiliated, and shocked after the incident. Please note that these are just current allegations and rebuttals, and the court will further investigate and make a judgment.

Meanwhile, the NBA released a statement saying that they are aware of the case and are conducting an investigation. They will take appropriate actions to handle the matter and ensure compliance with the league's rules and standards.

In 2021, Howard joined the Philadelphia 76ers, marking his 17th season in his professional career. In the past few seasons, he has played for teams such as the Lakers, Hawks, Hornets, and Magic.
