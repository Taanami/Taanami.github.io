In the match between the Spurs and the Suns, the Spurs were behind the entire game, trailing by 13 points after the third quarter and facing a 20-point deficit at one point. However, the Spurs made a comeback in the fourth quarter and were only down by three points when Vassell missed a three-pointer and Wembanyama successfully made a putback. The Suns immediately inbounded the ball, but failed to call a timeout. This allowed Keldon Johnson to steal the ball and make a layup from the half-court line, completing a 20-point comeback and giving the Spurs their first lead of the game with only 1.2 seconds left.

 The Suns called a timeout, but KD's baseline jumper missed and the game ended with the Spurs winning by one point, securing their first victory on the road.

 Keldon Johnson scored a game-high 27 points and 4 assists, while Devin Vassell and Victor Wembanyama each added 18 points. Wembanyama also had 8 rebounds and 4 blocks. KD finished with 26 points and 7 assists, Eric Gordon had 20 points, and Grayson Allen contributed 19 points and 7 rebounds.
