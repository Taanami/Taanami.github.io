  如果說克拉與高國豪是球隊的主力得分手，那麼歐獅傅則是攻城獅的最後一道防線。歐獅傅身材龐大，防守端能擋住不少對手內線，攻城獅上季在內線防守一直是個大問題，歐獅傅是首次來台，但他的身材與球風都讓人印象深刻，雖然熱身賽兩戰平均只有4.5分，但他在防守端的貢獻相信會比數據更大。

 請繼續往下閱讀後場飆分但防守較差的克拉，跟前者相反的是外線攻擊力強但防守稍嫌較差的伯朗，他在熱身賽兩場都有上雙的得分，但防守端的表現仍需加強。相較之下，朱雲豪與洋將歐獅傅的防守能力似乎更穩定，但進攻端則沒有伯朗來得穩定。當然，這也是熱身賽的表現，未來會否有所調整，還要等待本季實際比賽的表現才能下定論。

 雖然四位洋將都有各自的優點，但林冠綸仍然會面臨一個難題，就是如何讓四位洋將發揮最佳狀態，並且跟本土球員有良好的默契，才能帶領球隊走出進攻當機的困境。

 請繼續往下閱讀總結：經過休賽季的風波，新竹攻城獅在開季前還是有一番作為，不僅補強相當到位，球隊也有了全新的球風，重回季後賽的目標也變得更具可行性。外線攻擊力強勢的攻城獅，將成為各隊需要提防的對手，但同時也面臨後衛過多的問題，如何妥善分配每位球員的上場時間，將是教練團需要解決的難題。讓我們一起期待新竹攻城獅在本季的精彩表現吧！

The Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions went through a disappointing season, slipping from first place in the regular season to last place in the second season, which must have been unacceptable for the fans.

Hoping to strengthen the team through the draft, the top pick Alassa and second-round pick Wang Yifan both ended up wearing jerseys from other teams, becoming non-existent. And the Lin Bingsheng incident during the off-season caused a huge stir in the basketball world, adding insult to injury for the team. Please continue reading. Even in the face of the storm, the Attack Lions still have some progress before the season starts. The experienced Zhang Shuren took over as the general manager and vowed to create a whole new style of play. The team's reinforcements so far have been quite effective.

Although there are still some areas for improvement seen in the pre-season games, the team is at least on the right track. It remains to be seen if the Purple Lions can "strike back" and return to the playoffs. Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions' goal this season is to return to the playoffs. Photo/ Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions Last season's record: 13 wins, 27 losses, 6th place in the regular season Please continue reading. Joining players: Wang Zigang, Liu Guangshang, Zhou Bohun, Shi Yanzong, Zhang Jiewei, Lu Guanxuan Departing players: Chen Zeyu, Ibaka, Guo Shaojie Foreign players: Artino (William Artino), Braun (Taylor Braun), Ochefu (Daniel Ochefu), Clark (Earl Clark) Will the backcourt become the new face of the Attack Lions? From the pre-season reinforcements to the performances on the court, it can be seen that the Attack Lions are focusing on one thing this year - the outside shooting. In the two pre-season games, the team averaged 39 shots and made 16.5 three-pointers. In the first game, they even made an astonishing 18 three-pointers, which accounted for more than half of the team's points. This is quite different from the team's usual playing style. It's worth noting that in the previous three seasons, the Attack Lions' average three-point attempts per game did not exceed 30, and their 29.5% three-point shooting percentage and 28.3 attempts per game in the previous season were among the lowest in the league. This year, however, they have changed their style and become a team that relies on the outside shooting for offense.

Looking at the players' positioning on the court during the pre-season games, it's clear that the Attack Lions have designated shooters in both the 45-degree and corner areas, and they don't hesitate to take shots when they have an open opportunity. Head coach Lin Guanlun also encourages his players to shoot whenever they have an open shot.

New additions Wang Zigang and Lu Guanxuan are both renowned shooters, with Lu Guanxuan having a three-point shooting percentage of over 40% last season and even winning the T1 League three-point shooting contest.

In addition to these two players, the team also has Kao Guohao and Zhu Yunhao, who pose a threat from the outside. The three new foreign players also showed their shooting abilities, so if everything goes well, the Attack Lions' outside shooting might become a force to be reckoned with this season.

Please continue reading. Too many guards on the team However, the biggest problem the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions will face this season is the abundance of guards. After being plagued by injuries to guards last season, the team strengthened their backcourt during the off-season. In addition to Wang Zigang and Lu Guanxuan, they also added former Steelmen foreign player Zhang Jiewei. With six original guards on the team, the Attack Lions now have a total of nine guards, which is quite a lot. However, with Wang Zigang and Zhang Jiewei injured and Tian Hao yet to return, the current six guards may not be a problem for coach Lin Guanlun. But when the injured players return, it will be a challenge for the coaching staff to allocate playing time for each player.

The good news is that this season, the PLG has changed the foreign player rule to 8 games per game. This will reduce the team's disadvantage in the fourth quarter.

Currently, it seems that Kao Guohao will pair up with Lu Guanxuan as the starting guards.

Zeng Boyu, who comes off the bench, averaged 5.4 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 1.5 assists last season. Although it's not a standout performance, he can play positions 1-3 and should get plenty of playing time in the early stages of the season. Other bench players like Jiang Guangqian, Lu Qimin, and Song Yuxuan may gradually fade out of the team if they can't earn the coach's favor.

Who will solve the problem of offensive breakdowns? In the official pre-season games, the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions suffered two consecutive losses. Although they played well, the biggest problem came in the third quarter. In both games, the Attack Lions had a double-digit lead at one point, but they suddenly had trouble scoring after scoring easy baskets.

During that period, no player on the team was able to step up and score or lead the team, which became the turning point of the game. If we were to choose one local player and one foreign player, I would choose Kao Guohao and Clark.

Clark has shown a highly efficient performance in the pre-season, and although he is 35 years old, he still has an impressive shooting touch, and he is also a solid player on both offense and defense. In the two pre-season games, he averaged 13.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks in just 17 minutes per game. If Clark can adjust to his new team and his chemistry with the team improves, he could put up some impressive numbers. Kao Guohao, the team's number one scorer last season with an average of 14.9 points per game, made it onto the second team of the year, and it seems that he has improved on both ends of the court this year. In the first pre-season game, he recorded an all-around performance of 20 points, 4 rebounds, and 5 steals. I personally believe that he can take his game to the next level this season, and I predict he will average between 18-20 points per game.

If Clark and Kao Guohao are the team's main scorers, then Ochefu is the last line of defense for the Attack Lions. Ochefu is a big man who can defend against many opponents in the paint, and the team's struggles in defending the paint last season were an issue. Ochefu is making his first appearance in Taiwan, but his size and playing style have left a deep impression on people. Although he only averaged 4.5 points in the two pre-season games, his contributions on the defensive end are believed to be greater than his stats.

Please continue reading. Clark, who can score but is a weaker defender, is the opposite of Braun, who is a strong outside shooter but needs to improve on the defensive end. In comparison, Zhu Yunhao and Ochefu seem to have more stable defensive abilities, but they may not be as consistent on the offensive end as Braun. Of course, this is just based on the performances in the pre-season games, and we'll have to wait and see how things pan out in the actual games this season before making a final judgment.

Although the four foreign players all have their own strengths, Lin Guanlun still faces a dilemma of how to get the best out of all four players and build chemistry with the local players in order to overcome their offensive breakdowns.

Please continue reading. Summary: After going through a tumultuous off-season, the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions still have some progress before the season starts. Not only have they strengthened their team, but they have also adopted a new style of play, making their goal of returning to the playoffs more achievable. With their strong outside shooting, the Attack Lions will become a team that other teams need to watch out for, but at the same time, they also face the challenge of too many guards. How the coaching staff will allocate playing time for each player will be a difficult issue to solve. Let's look forward to a great performance from the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions this season!
