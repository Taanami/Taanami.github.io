 Who will play the offensive positions of Abassi and Li Qiwei in the Asian Games for the Chinese men's basketball team?

In the 13th edition of "Looking at Chinese Men's Basketball," the Chinese men's basketball team made their final personnel adjustments after confirming Chen Yingjun's absence. Li Qiwei and four others were added to the starting lineup, providing not only substitute options for each position but also increased flexibility in deployment.

Li Qiwei has shown his skills as a precise long-range shooter in the later stages of the Jones Cup, adding another option to the offense. Abassi, on the other hand, was already set as the sixth man, serving as the first player off the bench to charge and break through the defense. How will these two players contribute to the Asian Games? Let's take a look.

Please continue reading below. As a specialist in off-ball movement, Abassi, originally from Senegal, officially became a local player this year and was immediately called up to the national team. In the past two professional seasons, he not only performed well but also won numerous individual awards, gaining recognition for his skills. It is expected that he will enhance the offensive capabilities of the Chinese team.

During the Jones Cup, Abassi fearlessly faced opponents with better physique and skills. He scored in double digits in the first four games and demonstrated excellent steal skills. His outstanding physical abilities allowed him to launch transition attacks and score points. In the game against Japan, he was like a sharp blade entering the paint, catching the defense off guard. He scored 31 points with a +/- value of 21, delivering his best performance of the tournament. Abassi's excellent off-ball movement is a result of his professional training. With his quick reflexes and high release point, he can easily shoot after receiving the ball. His explosive first step is also remarkable. Although he lacks finesse in dribbling skills to deceive opponents, his sharp senses and speed make up for it, making him a primary scoring option against stronger opponents. However, despite his impressive numbers, he still needs more opportunities to score due to his inconsistent shooting stability. How to improve his efficiency in scoring will be a crucial decision for Abassi during the offensive plays. In addition, as shown in the table above, Abassi is also not lacking in assists. Although he is not the primary ball-handler, he can attract double teams with his offensive threats and make effective passes, whether it is for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers or the Chinese national team. This ability to connect the team makes him a powerful weapon. He is willing to share the ball and has the habit of observing his teammates' movements during attacks. His excellent hang time allows him to find open teammates in the air. Perhaps he can assist in controlling the ball and alleviating pressure in the absence of Chen Yingjun.

The Chinese team lacks sufficient penetration ability, and Abassi will undoubtedly be a necessary player in the coming years. His ability to tear through defenses is a force that cannot be ignored. He will be the most important scoring option outside of the CBA's "big three" and Atino.

His shooting mechanics are stable and he has a good sense of balance. Whether playing for Pauian Archiland in the SBL or the Taipower Bears in T1, he is an important scoring force for his teams. He has never been selected for the national team before, so this is an excellent opportunity for him to prove himself.

In the Jones Cup, he played in all the games except against the United States, averaging 4.5 three-point attempts and making 2 shots per game. This level of consistency is not something that guards can achieve. Therefore, even if his scoring numbers are not as impressive as other key players, as long as he can make his shots, he can effectively create space for the offense. This allows players like Atino, Liu Zheng in the frontcourt, or Lin Tingqian and Abassi in the backcourt to have more opportunities to attack the paint. Please continue reading below. With the effective screening of Lin Tingqian and Atino, Li Qiwei's positioning becomes even more important. Rising to the starting lineup in the middle and later stages of the tournament, he prevents opponents from easily double-teaming or shrinking their defense. He has truly become the solution for the Chinese team's second and third positions.

However, his main weakness is evident, which is his lack of impact outside of offense. Particularly, his defense is relatively weak, making him vulnerable against opponents with strong forwards. He can only rely on his identity as a high tower shooter and cannot become an outstanding 3D player.

But with other players on the court who have more diverse skills in the Jones Cup, as long as Li Qiwei shoots well, even with about 20 minutes of playing time, he can still make significant contributions.

Li Qiwei is the best choice among the players added to the team this time, in the author's opinion. Although he lacks defensive skills, his height brings many advantages. The overall team height has been improved, allowing them to slow down opponents' penetration and shots, and even provide better defense and rebounding. In addition to his shooting ability, he is also a player with a great attitude. Regardless of whether the team is leading or trailing, he always brings a never-give-up mentality to the court. From being the sixth man in the past to now starting in the frontcourt, his professionalism deserves a chance to be tested. Please continue reading below. Who will be the best supporting player off the bench? The key to finding suitable supporting players through domestic professional basketball is crucial for the 18-man roster, which has now been reduced to the final 12. The "big three" of the CBA and naturalized player Atino are the core of the team's offense and defense. Finding players with sufficient offensive capabilities is especially important; otherwise, the main players may struggle to keep up with the scoring, and it may even lead to their inability to continue playing, resulting in a loss of competitiveness in the decisive stages of the game. Abassi is undoubtedly an offensive weapon for the young generation in China. His all-around and impactful offense, despite being only 189 cm tall, can bring trouble to opponents. He will be the primary offensive option outside of the core players. Li Qiwei's shooting ability may not dominate the game, but he is the most effective player in creating space for the offense. This will improve the team's height and reduce the disadvantages in defense and rebounding. Both players will be the best supporting players for the Chinese men's basketball team in the Asian Games, and their places in the rotation are already secured.
