# If Brunson were a king, he would need a very large crown to wear 
 If Brunson were a king, he would need a very large crown to wear. Jalen Brunson, NBA player, has the nickname "Big Headson" among Taiwanese fans. Recently, a fan group dedicated to the New York Knicks discussed Brunson's performance last year and concluded that Brunson is our king. This drew a response from Josh Hart, who jokingly remarked that Brunson has a big head and would need a large crown to wear. The Big Knick Energy fan page posted a message on X, stating that last year people said Brunson was overpaid, but now they see that his contract of approximately $40 million is a very good signing. Brunson is the king of our team! Unexpectedly, Josh Hart replied with a comment saying that if Brunson is a king, you need to prepare a very big crown for him because his head is so big. Last season, Hart joined the Knicks through a trade and reunited with his college teammate Brunson. During this time, they have shown a good relationship, often teasing each other on social media. Last year, the two of them teamed up to help the Knicks advance to the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs, where they battled the Miami Heat in a six-game series before being eliminated.
