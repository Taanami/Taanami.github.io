 China Blue team, the runner-up, and China White team, the sixth-place team, successfully concluded the 42nd William Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament for Men. The Chinese Blue team defeated the South Korean team with a score of 92-64, securing the second place. Meanwhile, the Chinese White team held their ground in the final moments and defeated the Iranian team with a score of 91-86, securing the sixth place.

"From the training camp until now, we can see that the players are fully committed, especially the veteran players like Zeng Wendong, Liu Zheng, and Lin Tingqian, who are very willing to lead the team," said Chinese Blue coach Sang Maosen. He mentioned that the team is currently in the process of integrating and adjusting, with about 60 to 70 percent cohesion. With about a month left until the Hangzhou Asian Games, they will move to Australia for a two-week training camp and play six friendly matches against local professional teams.

He mentioned that Chen Yingjun, the main guard, will still not be able to join the team on this trip to Australia, but his injury is recovering well, and it is expected that he will return before the Asian Games. "We don't need to worry about Yingjun's personality. He has already started training again, so he will definitely be brought to the Asian Games. However, in this Jones Cup, the team has gradually become accustomed to playing without guards in the lineup, and the ball movement has been smooth. So, this is also an opportunity for us to hone and adjust."

Liu Zheng believes that after nine days and eight games, the team is very tired physically, but they have benefited a lot as a team. "We can see that our scoring options are increasing, but at the same time, when our scoring options are being defended and contained, we need someone to step up, as well as our old problem of defending rebounds."

Lin Tingqian, who recently recovered from a cold, ended his first Jones Cup experience with the Chinese Blue team. He believes that the team is getting more and more adjusted, using the Jones Cup as a training opportunity to face different playing styles and gain various experiences. "For me personally, playing as a guard is not a position I'm familiar with, but I can learn and find ways to help the team."

The Chinese White team defeated the Iranian team with a score of 91-86. Five young players scored in double digits, and the team made only 11 turnovers. He Bo made 7 of 10 shots and contributed 18 points. He Dan made 4 of 8 three-pointers and scored 14 points, along with 5 assists and 6 steals. Ma Jianhao scored 14 points and had an impressive steal followed by a fast break dunk, thrilling the fans at the Peace Basketball Gymnasium. Chen Fanbaiyan contributed 13 points, and Ban Ba also scored 10 points.

"Through this tournament, I hope the players can improve each time, regardless of the results. With the experience of success or failure, they can grow and progress. These young players have met our expectations as coaches, and they have performed well and met these expectations," said Chinese White coach Xu Haocheng. He mentioned that throughout the Jones Cup, from the first game to the last day, it was evident that the players made breakthroughs, and he believes that these players have the opportunity to represent the Chinese team on the international stage. The He brothers, He Dan and He Bo, were the most popular figures of this Jones Cup. They thanked the Chinese Basketball Association for the invitation, coach Xu Haocheng for his guidance, and all the senior players from the Chinese Blue and White teams for their selflessness and willingness to share their experiences. They also thanked the passionate fans who joined them on this amazing journey in Taiwan this summer and expressed their hope to continue fighting together on the court and meet again next year.
