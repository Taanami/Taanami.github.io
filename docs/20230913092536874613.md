 The Denver Nuggets, in their 47th year in the NBA, defeated the Miami Heat with a final score of 94-89 to claim their first-ever NBA championship. Led by Nikola Jokic's 28 points and 16 rebounds, along with Michael Porter Jr.'s 16 points and 13 rebounds, the Nuggets staged a comeback in the fourth quarter to secure the victory.

In the best-of-seven NBA Finals series, the Nuggets emerged victorious with a 4-1 record, achieving their long-awaited goal of winning the franchise's first NBA championship.

In the fifth game of the series, the Nuggets, holding a 3-1 advantage, returned to their home court to face the Miami Heat. Despite Tyler Herro, the second-leading scorer for the Heat with an average of 20.1 points per game during the regular season, returning from injury, the Heat struggled to maintain their early lead. The Nuggets, led by Bam Adebayo's scoring, managed to take a 24-22 lead at the end of the first quarter.

The Nuggets struggled with their three-point shooting in the first half, making only 1 out of 15 attempts. With Adebayo's 18 points, the Heat held a 51-44 lead at halftime.

In the second half, the Nuggets, with Jamal Murray's three-pointer, tied the game at 60-60. The two teams engaged in a back-and-forth battle, with Michael Porter Jr.'s three-pointer giving the Nuggets the lead while Kyle Lowry's three-pointer helped the Heat regain the advantage. At the end of the third quarter, the Heat maintained a slim lead of 71-70. In the final quarter, the Nuggets took the lead after Jokic's basket and extended it to seven points at one point, but the Heat, led by Jimmy Butler's scoring, fought back to regain the lead. With 27 seconds remaining in the game, the Heat trailed 89-90 but made a critical turnover, allowing the Nuggets to secure the victory with four successful free throws. The Nuggets won the series 4-1 and claimed their first NBA championship since joining the league in 1976.

In this game, Jokic contributed 28 points and 16 rebounds, while Porter Jr. recorded 16 points and 13 rebounds. Murray added 14 points and 8 assists.

For the Heat, five players scored in double digits, with Butler leading the team with 21 points and Adebayo contributing 20 points and 12 rebounds. However, the Heat's overall rebounding performance, with 50 rebounds compared to the Nuggets' 71, proved to be a significant disadvantage.

The Denver Nuggets' victory in the NBA Finals marks a historic moment for the franchise. The team underwent a five-year rebuilding phase before Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, and coach Michael Malone led them to become the second team to win an NBA championship after merging from the American Basketball Association (ABA) into the NBA. The ABA and NBA were rival leagues until the ABA merged into the NBA in 1976, leaving only four ABA teams in today's NBA, including the Denver Nuggets, Brooklyn Nets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs.

The Spurs won their first championship in 1999, and now the Nuggets have become the second ABA team to win an NBA championship.

Founded in 1967 as one of the original ABA teams, the Nuggets were initially known as the Larks but changed their name to the Rockets before the first season and then to the Nuggets in 1974. They reached the ABA Finals in the last season before the ABA-NBA merger in 1976 but lost to the New York Nets.

Whether in the ABA or NBA, the Nuggets have consistently been a playoff team. In the nine seasons they competed in the ABA, they made the playoffs every time but only reached the Finals once. After joining the NBA, the Nuggets made the playoffs nine times in the 1980s and had a streak of 10 consecutive playoff appearances from 2004 to 2013. However, they never won a championship despite their consistent success.

Despite entering a rebuilding phase from the 2013-14 season onwards, the Nuggets quietly laid the foundation for their future success. They drafted Jokic in 2014, Murray in 2016, and Michael Porter Jr. in 2018. In 2015, they hired Malone as their coach. All these pieces finally came together in the 2018-19 season when they achieved a record of 54 wins and 28 losses, securing the second seed in the Western Conference.

Throughout their 47-year history, the Nuggets have had many notable players, including Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, and Carmelo Anthony. With George Karl as their coach, they played an exciting, offensive style of basketball in the 2000s, which stood out in an era dominated by defensive strategies. In 1999, they moved to their current home, the Pepsi Center, which is located at an elevation of 5,280 feet. The thin air at the high altitude has earned the Nuggets a reputation for having a significant home-court advantage.

Jokic, initially known for his slightly overweight appearance, underwent a transformation after his coach convinced him to give up his soda-drinking habit. He focused on getting in better shape and gradually became a dominant force on the court, eventually earning the title of MVP. Jokic, 28 years old and standing at 6 feet 11 inches, was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft with the 41st overall pick.

From the beginning of his NBA career, Jokic displayed exceptional skills and was selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. Despite his seemingly overweight physique compared to other players, Jokic's scoring average has steadily increased over the years, going from 10 points, to 16.7 points, to 18.5 points, and reaching 20.1 points per game during the regular season. His rebounding numbers have also improved, going from 7, to 9.8, to 10.7, and finally 10.8 rebounds per game. In the 2019-20 season, there was a slight decline, but he still maintained an average of 19.9 points and 9.7 rebounds per game.
