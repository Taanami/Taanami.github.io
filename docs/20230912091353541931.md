China Trust Commercial Bank (CTBC) invited Michael Porter Jr., the small forward for the Denver Nuggets, the NBA's 2022-2023 season champions, to visit Taiwan. Together with the CTBC special forces basketball team from New Taipei, they embarked on a four-day charity event. The first stop on their journey was the training base of the New Taipei CTBC special forces, where they not only exchanged training techniques but also shared the NBA championship experience with two middle school basketball teams sponsored by CTBC Bank. Gu Zhongliang, Chairman of the China Trust Anti-Drug Education Foundation, personally presented Michael Porter Jr. with a CTBC special forces jersey featuring the number 1 and "Porter Jr.", inviting him to be an ambassador for anti-drug education.

At the age of 25, Michael Porter Jr. was once hailed as a five-star high school player in the United States. However, he faced injuries and underwent multiple surgeries before making a comeback as a top player through relentless effort.

In the 2018 NBA draft, he was selected by the Denver Nuggets in the 14th overall pick of the first round and began his NBA career. He gradually established himself as a starting power forward for the team and helped them win their first championship in 47 years this season.

After arriving in Taiwan this morning, Michael Porter Jr.'s first stop was the CTBC special forces training base, where he exchanged training techniques with the special forces players and had a friendly match.

Michael Porter Jr. said that this visit to Taiwan focuses on charity work, hoping that his faith and his journey of pursuing dreams can influence more people.

During the half-court scrimmage with the CTBC special forces, Michael Porter Jr. noticed that every player on the team had excellent court vision and attacking confidence. He commented, "This is the strength that a championship team must have!" Michael Porter Jr. played alongside the CTBC special forces players.

From warm-ups to every complete training step, he fully demonstrates a professional level. He is someone that domestic basketball players can learn from." Today, Michael Porter Jr. actively shared offensive shooting skills and organizational leadership concepts with the players, successfully inspiring them with a positive attitude towards training.
