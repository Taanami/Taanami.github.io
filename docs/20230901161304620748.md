  PLG Responds to Taishin Team's Statement, Calls on Taishin Team to Uphold Integrity and Preserve the Taiwan Basketball League Environment

The Lion City Lions have issued a statement in response to the Lin Bing-Sheng incident and Taishin Team's previous remarks.

Today at 16:00, the Lion City Lions responded to the statement released by Taishin Yule Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Taishin Yule" or "Taishin Team") on August 18, 2023, regarding player Lin Bing-Sheng. The response aims to defend legal dignity and the rights of the team. Regarding the statement released by Taishin Yule Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Taishin Yule" or "Taishin Team") on August 18, 2023, regarding player Lin Bing-Sheng, the Lion City Lions respond as follows: 

Taiwan's basketball has flourished in recent years, with passionate support from a large fan base. Therefore, professionals and participating companies in the basketball industry should pay attention to their own words and actions, serving as role models.

Integrity and fulfilling commitments after signing a contract are basic moral principles for individuals. If a player deliberately incites a breach of contract, despite already signing with another team, it will seriously undermine the rejuvenated professional basketball environment in Taiwan. Furthermore, if society continues to tolerate such contract breaches, it will severely damage the legal order, with unimaginable consequences. Therefore, our company is deeply concerned about the impact of this malicious poaching incident on Taiwan's basketball community and the harm it has caused to the loyal fans.

We will take a firm stance to defend legal dignity and the rights of the team, and we will not allow such incidents to harm the growing Taiwan Basketball League. We are willing to extend our goodwill once again and urge Lin Bing-Sheng to respect the spirit of the contract. We also request that if Taishin Team is interested in players who have already signed with the Lion City Lions, they should engage in legal negotiations and transactions within the framework of a rule of law country. Conversely, if they continue to engage in malicious breaches and poaching, our company will take the strongest legal actions to defend the spirit of the rule of law and the rights of the team.
