On Friday, the United States and Germany had a thrilling game in the semifinals. Both teams scored unusually high points in recent FIBA international tournaments, with each team scoring at least 110 points. In the end, Germany secured a spot in the finals with a 2-point difference, thanks to Obst's crucial three-pointer.

Germany has several NBA players, with the most famous being Dennis Schroder, who has played for teams like the Hawks, Thunder, and Lakers. Before the semifinals, Schroder expressed his thoughts about the game, saying that he was happy to meet the United States on the World Cup stage and looking forward to facing his former teammate Austin Reaves.

After the game on Friday, Schroder and Reaves embraced tightly, showing their strong friendship. Reaves even went to the German team's locker room after changing his clothes to once again congratulate Schroder and commend them for making it to the final. Schroder also posted about this moment, saying that when he saw Reaves, tears almost came to his eyes.
