The Harsh Reality USA Men's Basketball May No Longer be Dominant

USA suffered a disappointing 113-111 loss to Germany in the semi-finals of the World Cup, ending their chances of becoming the most talented team in the tournament. However, this is not the end of USA basketball. The outcome of the World Cup for the USA team was expected, as they struggled offensively and lacked energy and awareness on the defensive end.

(Daniel Theis' early uncontested dunk showed that the USA team was not prepared to defend against this type of low corner screen.) Please continue reading as USA players were tired from defending against fast breaks and often failed to properly match up on defense. They struggled to stop Germany's ball handlers (such as Dennis Schroder) from driving into the paint.

In addition, they gave up on extra passes, turning their offense into a one-on-one matchup (in the final minutes of the game, when Anthony Edwards attempted a mid-range jumper, he passed it to an unsuspecting Jaren Jackson Jr., who was charging towards the paint instead of running to the perimeter as Edwards had intended.) They also committed fouls on Germany's three-point attempts, fell for their pump fakes, and allowed Germany to shoot a high 57.7% from the field. USA's rebounding performance was not terrible (although they were outrebounded by 23 in their previous game against Montenegro!), but there is room for improvement. Theis had a great game, contributing 21 points and 7 rebounds.

USA's full-court press was easily broken by their opponents and their half-court defense became predictable and lacked aggression.

Austin Reaves struggled in low post defense and became a target for Germany's offense.

Without Brandon Ingram due to upper respiratory issues, Steve Kerr had to manage the minutes of Jalen Brunson and Anthony Edwards as much as possible, but despite these adjustments, they still lost by one point.

Please continue reading All of these criticisms are valid, and for those who are disappointed with USA's performance in international competitions and believe that this team needs to reassess themselves, watching this USA team can be quite disheartening.

Of course, this team, which is supposed to be the strongest, did not live up to its potential. Some of the lineup decisions were questionable, such as why Brunson, who has been fouling out, was not included in the final five players on the court? Throughout the months of training and competition, this team lacked cohesion.

However, this is a flawed, undersized, and less versatile roster, playing under different rules and with new teammates, so this is just a small sample size. Additionally, there is a reason why Germany remained undefeated, including their talented NBA players, size, three-point shooting, and intangible fighting spirit.

At the same time, USA sent their (extremely talented) reserve roster.

In this World Cup environment, some NBA players were taken out of their usual roles on their teams and had to sacrifice their egos. Will this expand or shrink their roles? It will be interesting to see if their confidence will grow or diminish.

It can be a glimpse into a player's future, whether it is growth or stagnation, or it may not mean anything at all.

Ingram's and Jaren Jackson Jr.'s underwhelming performances should not cause concern for the Pelicans or Grizzlies, but these teams may have hoped to see the All-Star caliber performances that they usually see from these players.

Aside from Reaves, who was targeted by Germany's offense, they also weren't afraid to attack JJJ from the perimeter. Edwards led USA in scoring and was clearly the best player on the team.

He will read the game more decisively in the future and will undoubtedly surpass his performance in this tournament. He can easily become a star player who averages 28 points, seven assists, and five rebounds per game.

His defensive performance is also outstanding and should not be overlooked because of his impressive offense, which is one of the most exciting aspects of his game (especially on the defensive end).

Overall, USA's performance in this World Cup was not ideal, but it doesn't mean that they will no longer be the dominant force in international basketball. They still have the most talented players, the strongest team, and the most resources. As long as they face reality and make necessary adjustments, they can still dominate on the international stage.
