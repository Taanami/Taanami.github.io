 The feeling of going to war for your country is different - the chemistry between Tyrese Haliburton and the USA team

Before the start of the World Cup this year, Tyrese Haliburton talked to the media outlet Basketball Sphere about his expectations and the various challenges he faces in the World Cup and with the USA team.

Four years ago, the USA team finished with their worst-ever seventh-place finish in the World Cup. This time, led by Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton, they hope to bring the USA team back to glory.

Continue reading to learn about the feeling of wearing the national team jersey, the difference between wearing the Pacers' jersey, and what it feels like to play under Steve Kerr. Wearing the national team jersey is always their first choice, regardless of the type of competition they participate in.

After the disappointing performance in China two years ago, the USA team won the gold medal in the Olympics. "When you put on the national team uniform, the expectations are at their highest."

After the previous World Cup failure in China, the national team came back and won the gold medal in the Olympics. This makes you want to be part of a successful group, and no one wants to be associated with failure in the national team they are involved in.

Playing for the national team is a completely different experience. Last season, Haliburton achieved double-double numbers with an average of 20.7 points and 10.4 assists per game for the Pacers, which allows him to be a leader on this USA team alongside Anthony Edwards.

However, this extra responsibility is a new experience for him. "I would say that basketball means something different to me when I'm fighting for my country. We all need to find our best position here and maximize our contributions.

In the NBA, each team usually has two or three players responsible for handling the offense. However, the model is completely different in the USA team. Here, everyone needs to participate well in the overall team operation, better understand each other, and make contributions.

All of this is very interesting and dreamy for me." Restroom leader - no matter what sport it is, every team has two types of leaders - on-court and off-court.

The former leads the team to victory on the court, while the latter has the most say in the locker room, usually taken on by the most experienced player in the team.

"I would say Bobby Portis is the locker room leader of this USA team. He is one of the most experienced players on our team. Besides, his championship experience can lead us well."

Half-human, half-glory - Steve Kerr took over as the head coach after Gregg Popovich led the USA team to win the gold medal in the Olympics. As the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, Kerr has won the NBA championship four times and achieved the same success with Michael Jordan dominating the era as a player for the Bulls.

Now he has to prove himself again in the FIBA World Cup. "Coach Kerr always learns from the best, and everything he has experienced in his career is very inspiring, whether as a player or a coach. That's why it's great to work with him." It is very difficult to beat the same team twice in a row. The USA team was placed in Group C. Their opponents are Greece, Jordan, and New Zealand. Interestingly, during the preparation period, the USA played five warm-up matches and won all of them.

One of the defeated teams was Greece, and Giannis Antetokounmpo will not be playing in this World Cup.

Despite this, Haliburton closely observes the upcoming challenges. "As everyone knows, it is difficult in the sports world to beat the same opponent twice in a row. Greece knows what to expect from us when we play against them.

I am excited, and I think it will be very interesting. Every game has new challenges. As for the other opponents, I don't have much to say. We have been focusing on our team's progress and hoping to be well-prepared for the World Cup."
