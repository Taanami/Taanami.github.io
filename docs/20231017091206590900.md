 The intense trade rumors surrounding NBA stars Damian Lillard of the Trail Blazers and James Harden of the 76ers have once again sparked the NBA preseason. I discussed in detail in July about Lillard's situation.

In conclusion, Lillard will continue to fly for a while, and the team is in a favorable position. A recap of the previous situation: [NBA] Lillard, the final piece of the puzzle for the Heat's championship? Apart from these off-court factors, the key to whether the two sides can ultimately part ways amicably is how much the Heat can offer in terms of first-round draft picks and players that fit the Blazers' rebuilding strategy (such as Tyler Herro); a single trade is difficult, so the Bulls, 76ers, or Nets are likely to be involved in a three-way trade.

Time is on the team's side, and unless there are unexpected changes, Lillard will continue to fly for a while! Two months have passed, and the situation hasn't changed much. The only difference is that the preseason is approaching and the rosters of each team will be mostly set.

For the Blazers, Lillard, and the Heat, this is a time to increase pressure or test each other again. Therefore, there have been more rumors recently. Such as (1) the Heat's Nikola Jovic played well in the World Cup and the Blazers would agree to a trade if the Heat are willing to let him go.

(2) Lillard only wants to stay with the Blazers or go to the Heat's training camp. Other teams are unwilling, but then suddenly all teams are willing. (3) There are even reports from reporters who have long been covering the Blazers that Lillard was tricked by Blazers' GM Joe Cronin and is unhappy, so he insists on going to the Heat.

Or (4) league chairman Adam Silver called on professional players to respect the spirit of their contracts, and the league is not happy to see players demand trades all the time. Please continue reading for a brief discussion on Jovic. The biggest obstacle to Lillard's trade is not Jovic, but what "main dish" the Heat can offer. As for the highly anticipated Jovic, he left the second summer league game with discomfort in his left foot and has been sidelined since. Although he has been aggressive on the offensive end, his post moves are still a bit stiff, and his performance in transition is slightly better. His progress is not very obvious, and he is not at the level of a championship team's role player. We will see a clearer picture during the preseason. [NBA] Lillard, the final piece of the puzzle for the Heat's championship? Based on the previous reported trade packages, the Heat should be prepared to give up this year's first-round pick Jaime Jaquez Jr. or wingman Caleb Martin, so why not Jovic? After all, compared to directly competing for the championship, the aforementioned losses are not worth mentioning.

If the Blazers let go of Lillard, it means they have officially entered the rebuilding phase. To efficiently rebuild, they should aim for a large number of first-round picks or young and affordable potential rookies.

Please continue reading for more information on the trade salary cap and why the Heat's trade is just a last resort. If the Heat can offer a young big man who fits the Blazers' needs and has a good trajectory, they may be able to give up a few first-round picks.

It seems that hero-Tyler Herro is not on the Blazers' radar (I personally think he is good, but the Blazers' management may have a different opinion), so if the Heat wants to get a deal done quickly, they need to find a third or fourth team to facilitate a multi-team trade.

This is why there were previous rumors of the Bulls' Zach LaVine, the 76ers' James Harden, and even the Nets, and now the latest one is the Thunder.

The rest of the rumors or statements are just small talk and will not have any impact on the essence of the negotiations between the two sides. The Blazers' third overall pick Scoot Henderson is ready to take over the point guard position in the backcourt. Time is still on the Blazers' side.

The Heat want to make a deal as soon as possible, they must offer an irresistible offer, and if they can't cook it themselves, they can order takeout. If they can't do either, they can forget about getting a five-star rating from Michelin.
