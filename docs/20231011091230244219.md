  On the first day Ayton joined the Portland Trail Blazers, he felt like he was drafted again.

Deandre Ayton, another key player in the trade involving Damian Lillard, also made his way to his new team, the Portland Trail Blazers. In this trade, the Blazers also sent out Jusuf NurkiÄ‡, and Ayton naturally became the starting center for Portland, forming the future starting lineup with Anfernee Simons, Scoot Henderson, and Shaedon Sharpe.

Today, Ayton arrived in Portland and the community shared a video of his first day at the training facility. It is evident that Ayton is very happy and he refers to himself as "dominAYTON" (a combination of dominate and Ayton). In the video, he expressed his gratitude for joining Portland and mentioned that he is ready and excited for the upcoming season. He feels like being in Portland is like being drafted again, and in the new season, he will be wearing jersey number 2. Additionally, it is worth noting that there is no presence of Jrue Holiday in the Blazers' videos and social media, indicating a high probability of him being traded by the Blazers once again.
