 Building a Taiwanese version of the NCAA basketball stage, the National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) has initiated the "CBL College Basketball Home and Away Invitation Tournament". This fall, NTNU has invited six teams from the northern region of Taiwan, including National Chengchi University, National Taiwan University, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, National Taiwan University of Arts, and Chien Hsin University of Science and Technology, to participate in the tournament. Following the format of the NCAA home and away games, the aim is to bring basketball competitions into the campus and create a new and cohesive sports atmosphere.

Today (10/3) in the afternoon, a press conference for the opening of the tournament was held at the NTNU Golden Hall. Representatives from the six teams, team leaders, principals, and NTNU alumni, including Wu Yongren, were present. As a prelude to the annual University Basketball Association (UBA) tournament, NTNU President Wu Cheng-Chi stated, "Sports should not only be about competition, nor should it be solely focused on winning trophies and medals. In the United States, we can see that through the home and away game system of the NCAA, student sports become an integral part of campus culture, a core that brings students and alumni together. That is the true value of sports."

NTNU President Wu Cheng-Chi hopes to bring a fresh sports atmosphere to Taiwanese basketball and campuses through the successful home and away experience of the NCAA.

Former NTNU alumnus and coach of the National Chengchi University men's basketball team, Chen Ziwei, said, "The home and away system of the NCAA in the United States is a management model that Taiwan should emulate. It not only builds a bridge for communication between current students and alumni but also creates sustainable benefits for the development of sports."

NTNU men's basketball coach Li Binghong responded, "Different from playing in the same arena in the league, the home and away system highlights the players' adaptability to different venues, adding more diverse challenges to the games." He also jokingly called out to Chen Ziwei, "When NTNU won three consecutive championships on our home court, the coach of the three-peat has now moved to another school and won another three-peat. I look forward to competing with him in the home and away games and taking back the three-peat from his hands." Chen Ziwei believes that the home and away system of the NCAA and the campus sports atmosphere are management models that Taiwan should emulate.

"I am honored to participate in this feast as an outstanding alumnus. I thank my alma mater for providing this platform for players to showcase themselves and for providing them with more opportunities. All opportunities are valuable and important. I encourage my junior fellow students to cherish and give their best, and to enjoy the atmosphere of home and away games," said Wu Yongren. He believes that introducing successful experiences from other countries will inject new positive energy into Taiwanese basketball and is an important factor in helping domestic basketball players grow and improve.

"In the current limited situation of the basketball system in Taiwan, I hope that NTNU can take the initiative to implement it, and I also thank the six schools for their willingness to participate and contribute, together transforming the sports atmosphere on campuses in Taiwan," said Wu Yongren. 

This invitation tournament will take place from October 5th to November 30th, lasting for two months. Ji Likang, the dean of the College of Sports and Recreation Management at NTNU, believes that the CBL invitation tournament is not just a competition, but also a starting point for the continuous development of student basketball and the sports environment in Taiwan. As an outstanding alumnus of NTNU, Wu Yongren attended the press conference in the afternoon to show his support and encouragement to the students.
