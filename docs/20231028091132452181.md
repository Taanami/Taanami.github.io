  Possible Blueprint for the Trail Blazers, the Potential Ultimate Winner

Despite losing Damian Lillard and several key players, the Trail Blazers seem to be on the path of rebuilding. However, the return they received in trades may still keep the team competitive. In the three-way trade involving Lillard, the Blazers not only gave up Lillard, but also several key players (Jusuf Nurkic, Nassir Little, Keon Johnson). Many believe that the Blazers will face a long rebuilding process and produce disappointing results like other teams towards the bottom of the league, hoping to secure the top draft pick and rebuild the team's ability to compete for the playoffs.

However, after examining the players the Blazers received in exchange, it may be too early to assume that they will be a tanking team next season. Please continue reading to see how the trade with the Bucks for Jrue Holiday, and then to the Celtics, may have been a smart move for the Blazers. Not only did they secure the team's future, but they also improved their present.

Trail Blazers' general manager Joe Cronin's strategy was excellent, as he worked tirelessly to minimize the impact of Lillard's trade request, which initially only included the Heat.

The following are the players, draft picks, and pick swap rights that the Blazers received in the Lillard-Holiday trade: Players: Deandre Ayton, Robert Williams III, Malcolm Brogdon, Toumani Camara Draft picks: 2024 Warriors' first-round pick (top four protected), 2029 Bucks' unprotected first-round pick, 2029 Celtics' unprotected first-round pick Pick swap rights: 2028 Bucks' first-round pick swap rights, 2030 Bucks' first-round pick swap rights

Let's not speculate on whether Cronin will use Brogdon to acquire more draft picks or if the Bucks will become a team with high-value picks due to the departure of their star player Giannis Antetokounmpo. Let's just focus on the potential development of the Blazers. Cronin did not trade away any young rookies who have only been with the team for two years, nor did he acquire players with high salaries but no added value to the team.

In this trade, he acquired 2018 first overall pick Deandre Ayton, who has the potential to become a cornerstone for the team in the next few years, 2021-22 All-Defensive Second Team member and athletic monster Robert Williams III, and the steady and three-point shooting 2020-21 Sixth Man of the Year, Malcolm Brogdon.

Cronin stated during media day, "We want Malcolm to be a part of this team. He brings a lot of value on the court, and off the court, he can be a great leader and big brother to our young players. We need players like him because our roster is young, and I want to have enough veterans to guide these young guys."

If the Blazers don't make any further changes to their roster, their starting lineup for next season may look like this: Point guard: Malcolm Brogdon, Scoot Henderson Shooting guard: Anfernee Simons, Shaedon Sharpe Small forward: Jerami Grant, Matisse Thybulle Power forward: Robert Williams, Kris Murray, Jabari Walker Center: Deandre Ayton (with Robert Williams III as backup center)

This lineup does not resemble a rebuilding team, but instead, it reflects the Blazers' underwhelming results in the past two seasons. Of course, there are still variables to consider. First, Brogdon and Williams must stay healthy throughout the season. Second, rookies Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe must show significant improvement, and lastly, Deandre Ayton must be willing to play defense.

If everything goes according to plan, the Blazers may have a chance to compete in the play-in tournament next April.

This kind of development is not uncommon in the league. Last season's Jazz are a great example. Before the 2022-23 season, the Jazz traded away their two key players, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. Losing both their star guard and center seemed like a typical rebuilding move.

However, general manager Danny Ainge did not immediately trade away the remaining key players, Mike Conley, Jordan Clarkson, and Jarred Vanderbilt, as everyone expected. Instead, he paired them with the newly acquired Collin Sexton and first-time All-Star selection, Lauri Markkanen.

The Jazz had a decent record of 12 wins and 8 losses at the beginning of last season. Throughout the season, they maintained a winning percentage of 50% until the front office decided to trade Conley and Vanderbilt for other players and draft picks. After the trade in February, the Jazz still had a shot at the playoffs for a while, but ultimately, the team decided to focus on obtaining higher draft picks. In their final 11 games, they lost 9 games. The rookies they acquired in the trade, Walker Kessler and Ochai Agbaji, have shown some promise, and with the three draft picks they acquired (Taylor Hendricks, Keynote George, Brice Sensabaugh), as well as the ones they haven't used yet, the Jazz have a strong team for the present and the future.

This kind of scenario is not uncommon in the league, as the Lakers also managed to rebuild a championship-contending team after Kobe Bryant's retirement.

Therefore, the Blazers' current roster is not as bad as many people may think, and they may have a chance to become the ultimate winners next season.
