  According to recent reports, Oklahoma City plans to build a new arena for the local NBA team, the Thunder. The arena, which will be called Paycom Center, is expected to open in 2029 and will cost approximately $900 million. The Thunder has also promised to remain in Oklahoma City until at least 2050. The proposal for a new arena has been in development for over a year and will be put to a public vote on December 12th to determine whether or not the city will provide tax incentives for the team.

 The new arena will cost approximately $900 million, with the Thunder organization contributing only $50 million. The team has also committed to staying in Oklahoma City until at least 2050, and has recently updated the large screen at their current home, the Paycom Center. The bond between the Thunder and the city runs deep, as the team has made significant efforts to be involved in the community since moving to Oklahoma City in 2008. Mayor David Holt stated in a press release regarding the new arena, "The majority of our citizens have expressed a desire to see the Thunder remain in our city for the long term, and we have worked hard to make that happen without raising taxes. This agreement is a win-win, and the most important aspect is the length of time the Thunder has agreed to stay – twice as long as the commitment we made in 2008 – until 2050. By investing in the Thunder, the city will see economic benefits that far outweigh the cost of the investment."
