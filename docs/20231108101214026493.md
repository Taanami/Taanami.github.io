 Jordan Poole was on fire in the previous game, scoring 41 points, but his hot hand quickly turned cold in the following game against the Toronto Raptors. In tonight's game, he only made one out of 15 shots and finished with a disappointing 7 points. The Washington Wizards suffered a 36-point loss to the Raptors. Poole's performance in the four preseason games has been inconsistent, as he only scored 11 points in the game before and made only 2 out of 13 shots. In the game before that, he scored 18 points, making 6 out of 13 shots.

In the first quarter, the Wizards had a good start and quickly took a 7-0 lead. However, the Raptors responded with a 19-2 run and took the lead. Throughout the game, the Raptors maintained a 5-10 point lead, and in the late third quarter, they pulled away with another big run, increasing their lead to over 20 points, with a maximum lead of 40 points. The Wizards' best player tonight was Deni Avdija, who missed the first two preseason games and had a rough offensive night in the previous game. However, he bounced back tonight and scored 18 points in 20 minutes, shooting 7 for 14, including 4 out of 7 three-pointers, making him the team's leading scorer.
