On Friday, the United States and Germany played a thrilling match in the quarterfinals. Both teams scored unusually high for an international FIBA game, with each team scoring at least 110 points. In the end, Germany secured their ticket to the finals with a slight 2-point lead, thanks to Obst's crucial three-pointer.

Reaves, after changing his clothes, went to the German team's locker room again to congratulate Schroder and express his admiration for their advancement to the final. Schroder also posted about this moment, saying that when he saw Reaves, tears almost welled up in his eyes.
