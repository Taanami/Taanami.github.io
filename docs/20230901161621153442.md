 The Jones Cup, also known as the "Self-Indulgence Cup" or "Self-High Cup," has been widely discussed in the basketball community in recent years. There have also been similar terms such as "Self-High Cup" or "Poor Loser Cup." However, even if the Jones Cup is considered a self-indulgent or self-high cup, so what? The William Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament, which was held after a three-year hiatus due to the pandemic, took place in Taipei Peace Basketball Gymnasium this year and officially concluded on August 20th. In the women's division, the Japanese team won the championship, while the Chinese teams finished in the third and fourth places. In the men's division, the United States won the championship, with the Chinese teams finishing in second and sixth places. The tournament's All-Star Five consisted of Liu Zheng, Lin Tingqian, Atino, Du'Vaughn Maxwell from the South Korean team, and Pierre Crockrell II from the American team.

Before discussing this topic, it is important to understand the brief history of the William Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament. Renato William Jones, born in 1906, was one of the founders of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) in 1932 and served as its secretary-general for over 40 years. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the development of basketball, including making basketball an Olympic sport and promoting it worldwide.

Since 1966, William Jones organized invitation tournaments around the world, including in countries like Spain and Argentina.

In 1971, China officially joined the United Nations, and in 1974, the Chinese Basketball Association joined FIBA. As a result, Taiwan lost its membership. However, William Jones authorized the Chinese Basketball Association to organize international invitation tournaments in his name. Due to his significant influence in the world of basketball, the William Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament attracted countries from all over the world, including the United States, France, Denmark, South Korea, the Philippines, and Saudi Arabia. The first edition of the William Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament was held in 1977. Today, the tournament has reached its 42nd edition, with some interruptions due to the Chinese Taipei Gymnasium fire, SARS, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, the Jones Cup remains significant to Taiwanese basketball fans.

In recent years, the Jones Cup has been referred to as the "Self-Indulgence Cup" or "Self-High Cup," among other similar terms. The main reasons for such comments are twofold.

First, there is a significant gap in the strength of participating teams. It is a fact that some teams in the Jones Cup have a much higher or lower level of competitiveness compared to international tournaments. For example, the South Korean team, which has traditionally sent their national team, had to send the championship team of the previous KBL season, Anyang KGC, due to scheduling conflicts this year. The Philippines also sent a professional team, the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters, from the PBA.

Second, Taiwan often faces challenges in international competitions. The absence of Hamed E. Haddadi, who used to dominate in the Asian basketball scene, has weakened the Iranian team. The Japanese team consists of university players without the inclusion of players who participated in the World University Basketball Championship or the main players of the runner-up and champion teams of the WUBS. The United States is represented by the NCAA Division I team, UC Irvine.

Given the above, it is understandable why there are comments about significant gaps in strength.

However, even if the Jones Cup is considered a self-indulgent or self-high cup, so what? Looking back at the history of Taiwanese basketball, there was a dark period when Taiwan couldn't interact or compete with the outside world. Thanks to the efforts of previous generations, the authorization from William Jones and the birth of the Jones Cup became possible. Moreover, due to the continuous efforts of many people, including players, coaches, team administrators, organizers, staff, sponsors, and supporting fans, the Jones Cup has been able to continue for 42 editions. How many international invitation tournaments worldwide have reached such a milestone? In this process of 42 editions, everyone involved deserves recognition.

Furthermore, how many opportunities does Taiwan have to host international tournaments, especially in basketball? Besides the Jones Cup, looking back at the data, there were only a few events such as the 2nd Asian Basketball Championship held at the Chinese Taipei Gymnasium in 1963, the 2002 Asian U18 Women's Basketball Championship, the inaugural 2004 Asia Challenge Cup, the 2017 World University Games, and the ongoing 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Warm-up Games organized by the T1 League at the Xinzuang Gymnasium. The chance to witness basketball talents from around the world in Taiwan is rare. So even if the Jones Cup is considered a self-indulgent or self-high cup, so what? Its existence allows Taiwan's basketball to connect with the world, exchange ideas with other countries, and evaluate the progress made throughout the year. It is a valuable opportunity. In the end, the players, coaches, and other members of the Chinese Taipei national team often feel the most neglected.

As fans, we all have experiences in our lives where we have the opportunity to showcase our achievements, compete, or perform on a stage. When such hard-earned opportunities arise, don't we hope that our loved ones or fans can witness the glory? With the advantage of a home court filled with supportive fans, wouldn't there be more fighting spirit? The answer to these questions is undoubtedly yes. The members of the Chinese Taipei national team rarely have the opportunity to enjoy the advantage of a home court in most international competitions. The rare chance to experience the support of the entire crowd and have family and friends present to witness their best performances at the Jones Cup can be incredibly moving.

The Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament has a long history. Regardless of whether Taiwanese basketball is going through a low period, the Jones Cup has persevered and become one of the most representative events in Taiwanese basketball, indirectly representing Taiwan's basketball culture. This tournament and culture cannot be solely protected by the organizers and participants. As fans, we should also come together and support it. We can consider the Jones Cup a self-indulgent or self-high cup, but so what? Excessive criticism and negativity will not help Taiwanese basketball progress. Most fans genuinely hope for the improvement of Taiwanese basketball. However, creating a supportive environment requires not only the willingness of corporations and organizations to provide support but also the support of fans. Be a rational fan. Believe that one day, Taiwanese basketball will be seen by more people worldwide.
