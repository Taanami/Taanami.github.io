Porter was invited to Taiwan for a series of charity events, with the highlight being the opening pitch for the Chinatrust Brothers team. However, the game was delayed due to rain, but Porter still went on to throw the first pitch. Before the pitch, a fan suddenly rushed onto the field and hugged Porter tightly. The host and translator quickly pushed the fan away while Porter maintained a smile and shook hands with the fan.

The fan in white later escaped from the staff's control and ran around the field. Porter saw this and jokingly said, "Run my boy, run!" Finally, the fan was removed and Porter continued the interview, saying, "I'm very happy to be here and excited to throw the first pitch. I might throw it too fast, so the audience should be careful." Before the game, Porter also learned a few moves from the Brothers' pitching coach, hoping to show them to the fans. In the end, he did use a lot of force to throw the pitch, but the angle was off and the ball bounced into the catcher's glove before Porter even landed.
