  Video: NBA Eastern Conference Finals - Celtics Shocking Comeback to Tie the Series 3-3 Against Heat with 0.1 Second Buzzer Beater

In the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, the Boston Celtics were once in a 0-3 deficit but managed to make a comeback and shockingly defeat the Miami Heat 104-103 with a buzzer beater by Derrick White III. This victory also tied the series 3-3, giving the Celtics a chance to make history. 

After the first three games, the Miami Heat led the series 3-0. However, the Boston Celtics fought back with two consecutive wins in Game 4 and 5. In Game 6, the Heat still had a 3-2 lead in the 7-game series. The game was closely contested and the Celtics were leading 34-29 after the first quarter with strong performances from Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. 

In the second quarter, the Celtics continued to maintain their lead, but the Heat made a strong comeback and closed the gap to only two points. However, the Celtics still led 57-53 at halftime. The Celtics' shooting percentage of 51.3% was the key to their lead, but their three-point shooting was only 20%, which prevented them from pulling away from the Heat. 

In the second half, the Heat came close to overtaking the Celtics after a layup by Gabe Vincent, but the Celtics quickly responded with a 13-point lead thanks to Marcus Smart and Al Horford. The Celtics maintained their lead with strong performances from Derrick White III and Jaylen Brown, ending the third quarter with a 79-72 lead. 

In the fourth quarter, the Heat made a strong comeback with 11-3 run, briefly taking the lead with 83-82. However, the Celtics responded with an 8-0 run to regain their lead at 90-83. Heat's star player Jimmy Butler had a slow start with only 9 points in the first three quarters, but he made a comeback in the fourth quarter, scoring 15 points. With only 3 seconds left in the game, he made all three free throws to give the Heat a one-point lead, and they had a chance to close out the game and advance to the NBA Finals. 

But with only 0.1 second left, Marcus Smart's three-pointer missed, and Derrick White III made a game-winning shot, giving the Celtics a narrow victory. No team has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit in the NBA playoffs, but the Celtics managed to tie the series after three consecutive wins. If they can win Game 7 at home on Monday, they will make history. 

The Celtics' Jayson Tatum scored the highest with 31 points and 11 rebounds, while Jaylen Brown had 26 points and 10 rebounds. Marcus Smart also contributed 21 points for the team. For the Heat, six players, including all five starters, scored in double digits, with Butler scoring 24 points and 11 rebounds, Caleb Martin with 21 points and 15 rebounds, and Bam Adebayo with a double-double of 11 points and 13 rebounds. 

The Celtics are now only one win away from becoming the first team in NBA history to overcome a 3-0 deficit. The Game 7 will be played on Monday at 8:30 PM ET on TNT.
