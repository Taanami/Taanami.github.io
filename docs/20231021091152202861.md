It can be viewed on the NBA official website by logging into your account. One scene in the film has been specially selected for promotion. The documentary mainly records scenes from last year's game. During a break in training, Jokic's teammate Jamal Murray asked him what he was doing. Jokic seemed very focused on his phone and replied with a blank expression, "I'm collecting horses." Murray was surprised and asked him, "You're collecting horses? How many do you have now?" Jokic said, "Probably around 7, 8...uh...10, 12." Last week, Jokic was also caught by the team's official camera receiving treatment while watching videos about horses, showing his genuine love for them.
