 The Miami Heat and the Portland Trail Blazers are expected to resume trade negotiations, with the Heat hesitating on whether to include Caleb Martin in the package. Caleb Martin had a solid performance in the Eastern Conference Finals this year, helping the Heat defeat the Celtics in the series. According to reports, Damian Lillard is expected to only report to training camp with either the Heat or the Trail Blazers. However, according to Blazers reporter Aaron Fentress, if a trade is reached with another team, Lillard would go to his new team and give his best performance. Fentress also reported that Lillard still has an inclination towards joining the Heat, but his stance has become less firm since the league became involved.
