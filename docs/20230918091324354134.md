Japan's men's basketball team achieved excellent results in this year's World Cup and secured a spot in the upcoming Tokyo Olympics.

When asked in an interview if Rui Hachimura will represent Japan in the Olympics next year, head coach Tom Hovasse gave his opinion on the matter.

Regarding Japan's impressive performance in the World Cup, Hovasse did not praise the team but rather described their performance as "so-so." He said, "I have high expectations, so I won't easily praise them. I achieved good results, but I can do more. I don't know where the ceiling is, but I'm excited because the job is not done yet."

Speaking about Japan's performance against Cape Verde in the second half, Hovasse mentioned that the team still needs improvement. He said, "We want to showcase our basketball for 40 minutes, and our goal of a three-point shooting percentage below 40% was at 31.3%. We won with strong defense and fast offense, but both inside and outside shooting statistics are far from ideal. There is still room for significant improvement."

Regarding whether Rui Hachimura will participate in the Paris Olympics next year, Hovasse gave his perspective, saying, "Of course, we hope he will participate, but if he chooses not to, we can still form an excellent team. We have confidence. As people say, 'Who comes in and who leaves, everyone is an MVP' in this World Cup. Our basketball does not rely on any one star player. However, if he joins the Olympics, his presence will greatly enhance our strength. If he wants to do it, it should be his decision."

As for setting goals for the Olympics next year, Hovasse mentioned that it is not an urgent matter. He said, "I want to consider it slowly. It's important, so I don't want to set goals too easily."
