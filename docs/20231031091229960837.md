The Future of NBA Team Building: A New Version of the CBA Inspires Change

If you were to ask what we learned from the NBA this season, it's likely that the teams are changing the way they build their rosters.

This year, the league and the players' association approved a new collective bargaining agreement that clearly disadvantages the highest-spending teams, but also quietly puts more pressure on the lowest-spending teams.

For a long time, younger teams that rely on lottery picks have often tried to save money for a longer period of time. Part of the reason is that for lower-expectation teams, this is an easier way to barely get by. Please continue reading before the new CBA, there was no incentive for teams to spend money before they were ready to win. This created an environment where some teams started the season with a total salary far below the salary cap, hoping to use this space to make trades with desperate teams for draft picks. However, this will no longer be the case, as the Pistons are currently projected to have the most salary space at the start of the 2023-24 season - $31.5 million. This is a huge difference compared to the millions of dollars in salary space that teams had in previous seasons. The reason is that under the new CBA, saving money is not really an option.

Just look at the Rockets. They went from being one of the youngest teams in the league last season, tied with the Spurs for second-to-last place, to now being one of the top spending teams in free agency. The Rockets' accelerated timeline has a reason behind it. Of course, their young players can benefit from playing alongside true professionals and receiving guidance. Especially since the Rockets lacked a stable point guard before this season, their situation has now started to generate real developmental costs. However, under the new CBA, especially for teams like the Rockets who had nearly $60 million in salary space at the start of the summer, there is nothing they can do besides spend money.

Please continue reading in general, it takes NBA management a few seasons to fully adapt to the market environment brought about by the new CBA, but the Rockets are the first team to break through this barrier. They quickly solved all the problems and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on players like Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Jock Landale, and Jeff Green.

These trades all come with conditions, including team options for VanVleet and Green, salary decreases for Brooks within the contract term, and a four-year contract for Landale (the last three years of which are not guaranteed).

These are all measures taken by management because they can no longer sit on a salary cap space like they did in the past. Under the previous CBA, teams were mildly encouraged to spend 90% of the cap space before the last day of the regular season (known as the salary floor), and there would be no significant impact if they didn't. The new CBA moved this deadline up to the first day of the season, and it has a real impact - any unused salary cap space will be cut to the salary floor, and teams that fail to reach the floor will be fined with the luxury tax and prevented from making any trades that would reduce their total salary for the season.

Please continue reading these tightening measures have become meaningless. Not only does each team have to increase its spending to reach the salary floor, but teams that fail to reach the floor will also lose more money and rebuilding opportunities in the process.

So far, the result has been that secondary teams in the league play a more active role in the free agent market or through offseason trades for veterans, just like the Pistons trading for Cam Payne and Cedi Osman. Last year, the Spurs greeted the new season with a salary total that was far below the salary floor and nearly $30 million below the salary cap, but now they are projected to exceed this salary total in the 2023-24 season (as well as the generation of Victor Wembanyama), and almost every other team is in the same situation.

Stockpiling salary cap space is no longer useful. If any team chooses to only reach the salary floor, they will only have $13.6 million in space to absorb salaries throughout the season, which is not even enough to afford players like D'Angelo Russell or Marcus Morris. Lower-spending teams will not have enough space to operate (or in other words, there is currently almost no salary space available for rent), making it much more difficult for championship-contending teams to reduce salaries when needed. If there are not a few lottery teams each year waiting to assist, then all the affairs of the league will become more complicated, and these potential helpers will behave more like the Rockets, Spurs, or Pistons, meaning that they are closer to being a true NBA team, and this will lead to a chemistry experiment.

Compared to last season, the Rockets undoubtedly have a better and more complete roster, and they have just acquired some veterans, including an All-Star starting point guard and a confident wing player, who they expect to play important roles in a young team still in the process of growth.

With the removal of salary restrictions, the Rockets will have more opportunities to sign key free agents or compete for players that teams do not want to pay high salaries for in the trade market. This is a huge shift for the Rockets, who were always limited by salary space in the past, and now they can start building a true NBA team. This is also an important shift for the league, as it means that there will be more teams joining in this transformation in the future.
