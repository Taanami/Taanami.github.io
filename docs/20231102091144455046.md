 Hangzhou Asian Games: Gap in talent not the main issue, Chinese Taipei lost to China in fundamentals 

In the previous game, the Chinese Taipei team easily defeated Hong Kong, but in the second game of the Hangzhou Asian Games, they were defeated by the host team China. In the first quarter, they fell behind by double digits. Although they gradually recovered in the second quarter and narrowed the gap to 9 points at one point, China extended their lead after the break and ultimately won by 20 points. This was the first defeat for the Chinese Taipei team in this tournament. In this post by Basketball Notes on Instagram, let's continue reading about the lack of execution in fundamentals being the main reason for the loss, rather than the gap in talent and the lack of a point guard for the Chinese Taipei team.

However, the lack of execution in fundamentals may be the root cause of the loss. Facing the taller Chinese team, how to overcome the disadvantage in size and maximize their speed advantage was demonstrated by the Chinese Taipei men's basketball team at the World University Games. In this year's Chengdu World University Games, the Chinese Taipei team faced China in the group stage and used continuous pick-and-roll and cutting plays to force China to switch on defense, creating communication flaws and mismatches that allowed their players to take advantage of. However, in the Hangzhou Asian Games, the Chinese Taipei team attempted to use similar tactics, such as the "Flex" play, to force China to switch on defense, but the execution was not as effective.

They spent a lot of time setting screens and making cuts, but still couldn't create open shots, resulting in an endless cycle of one-on-one plays.

Against China's strong defense, the Chinese Taipei team's individual efforts were not efficient. Lin Ting-chien and Liu Chen's shooting percentages were both below 40%, combining for only 18 points. Although Artino scored 20 points, most of them were hard-fought baskets. It's not that the execution of this group of Chinese Taipei players is inferior to the previous World University Games team. After all, the effectiveness of execution is relative and cannot be judged solely based on the results. The higher the opponent's defensive intensity, the greater the challenge for execution.

Clearly, the Chinese Taipei team's execution was not enough to handle the adult-level Chinese team's defense. This could be due to the change in coach from Charlie Parker to coach Donewald, which required players to adapt to a new system, coupled with limited training time, resulting in poor execution.

If Chen Ying-chun, Lin Wei-han, and Lee Kai-yen were able to play healthy, they could have helped with the team's organization and control of the pace. However, execution also relies on the team's overall understanding and cohesion with the tactics, and adding more point guards may not solve the problem immediately. It still needs to start with the basic training. Moreover, the Chinese Taipei team's personnel deployment and tactical configuration may also have room for improvement.

As mentioned in previous articles, since coach Donewald took over the national team, there has been an increase in the ratio of tall players playing as the primary playmakers. However, in this game, China's perimeter defense was very aggressive, making it difficult for the Chinese Taipei team's forwards to receive passes, resulting in the ball being stuck in the hands of the taller players for a long time. The problem is that most of the Chinese Taipei team's big men lack the ability to attack off the dribble, making it hard to pass the ball and also unable to create their own offense, leading to low team offensive efficiency.

In order to narrow the gap in size, the Chinese Taipei team usually maintains the traditional lineup of playing two players taller than 200 cm at the same time. However, when the power forwards and centers are not able to provide enough offensive threats, the coaching staff may need to make adjustments and consider using a "four small and one big" lineup, with players like Lee Chi-wei playing as the small-ball power forward. After all, coach Donewald has also used Chou Po-chun as a stretch-five, so why not put in a player with a higher three-point shooting percentage to speed up ball movement and create more open shots.

The Chinese Taipei team's defense in the paint was commendable in this game, as Artino was able to limit China's center Wang Zhelin, forcing him to commit two offensive fouls. Although the Chinese Taipei team was outrebounded by the opponent by 18 offensive rebounds, they only allowed China to score 17 points through second-chance opportunities, not allowing them to rely on their size advantage. The bigger issue for the Chinese Taipei team's defense may have been their lack of focus.

Not only in half-court defense, but they were also caught off guard several times by Zhang Zhenlin's backdoor cuts and were slow to get back on defense in transition, allowing China to score 18 fast-break points compared to their 7.

When facing a team with better talent, it's even more important to have a solid foundation and play at their own level in order to have a chance to compete. If they can't even display their own abilities, there's no point in talking about narrowing the gap. Therefore, before discussing the talent gap between the Chinese Taipei team and China, it's more important to focus on their cohesion and defensive focus, which are fundamentals.
