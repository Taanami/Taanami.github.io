 In 2023, the Trail Blazers have quickly flipped Jrue Holiday to the Celtics, according to Woj. The trade sent Robert Williams, Malcolm Brogdon, and the 2024 Golden State Warriors' first-round pick and the 2029 unprotected Boston Celtics' first-round pick to the Blazers.

The Warriors' first-round pick is protected for the top four, and it is likely to be redeemed this season.

While Jrue Holiday is a great player, he doesn't fit into the Blazers' rebuilding plans. The team quickly posted news of DeAndre Ayton joining the team, but there was no mention of Jrue Holiday. This made it clear that the Blazers were planning to trade him. The new addition, Malcolm Brogdon, doesn't fit into the team's timeline due to his age and position, and he may be the next player to be put on the trading block. Robert Williams' situation is also intriguing. He has been inconsistent and has had injury concerns (a knee injury that Blazers fans are all too familiar with), but he still has three years left on his contract and is only 26 years old.

However, his incredible rim protection and shot-blocking abilities are rare in the league and have been a major need for the Blazers on the defensive end. If they can figure out his role on the offensive end, the Blazers will have a strong frontcourt presence.

It's too early to discuss the Blazers' potential starting lineup, as they are likely to continue to trade Brogdon and push for another deal. Since Brogdon's salary is a significant $22.5 million, the team may have to trade for another high-priced player to make the salaries match. This could result in a chain of trades, creating a trade machine. The Blazers have been rapidly accumulating assets, and if we were to consider who has made the most progress in the 2023 season, it would have to be general manager Joe Cronin. His recent trades have not only accumulated assets but also brought in high-caliber players who have proven their abilities.

These players all have a clear role on the team: Jrue Holiday's ball-handling and lockdown defense, DeAndre Ayton's athleticism, Malcolm Brogdon's efficiency and high basketball IQ, and Robert Williams' elite rim protection.

Not only do they possess great skills, but they are also considered top players in their respective fields in the league. This makes it easier for the Blazers to find trade partners and create more competition, resulting in better trade conditions.

With the decision to part ways with Lillard, the Blazers have officially entered a full rebuild mode. This also means that no player on the team is untouchable, except for players like Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe, who the team plans to develop in the long term. Even players like Jerami Grant and Matisse Thybulle, who were just signed during the offseason, could be moved after the league's trade restrictions have been lifted.

In just two years, Joe Cronin has completely revamped the Blazers' lineup. Besides Anfernee Simons, the rest of the team has been acquired since last season.

After a series of trades, the Blazers have a brand new look. Similar to what Sam Presti did with the Thunder, the Blazers' rebuilding process has been surprisingly fast. In these two trades, the Blazers acquired three first-round picks and two young talents. And it's still ongoing. Cronin's trades keep getting better and better. The 2023 Trail Blazers summer: rebuilding is necessary. The current situation is frustrating, with zero reinforcements. Lillard trade analysis: Farewell, Dame.
