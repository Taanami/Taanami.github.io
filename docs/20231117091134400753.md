 NBA star Jimmy Butler surprised the league with his new long hairstyle, which received a lot of attention from fans. During media day, his teammate Bam Adebayo couldn't help but laugh at his new look, even to the point of tears.

In another video, Adebayo can be heard saying that Butler's lip ring is annoying, to which Butler responds, "I have to maintain my character." Adebayo then jokes, "Sh*t, you really went to get this hairstyle for media day." Butler explains, "It's my Halloween costume."

During a press conference, Adebayo was asked about his thoughts on Butler's new hairstyle. Adebayo replied, "I think he's misunderstood, we all have our moments of getting into our feelings." He was also asked how his mother would react if he kept his hair like Butler's, to which Adebayo joked, "She would beat my butt for sure."
