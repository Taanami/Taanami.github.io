 The video transformed the basketball court into a carnival as the Serbian basketball preseason game was moved outdoors. The fans of KK Partizan, the Serbian powerhouse, showed their passion for the game by setting off fireworks at the sidelines. This enthusiasm for basketball, football, and any sport is not well known by Taiwanese fans. With the recent end of the World Cup, preseason games are now being held in various locations. KK Partizan decided to hold their game outdoors and the European fans demonstrated their passion by setting off fireworks at the sidelines to support their team. The fireworks were set off even while the game was still in progress, as the team led by a large margin. The atmosphere was spectacular, especially when former NBA player PJ Dozier made a slam dunk and the signal flares and fireworks were set off simultaneously. The live broadcast of the game showed the smoke from the fireworks completely covering the screen. This game was also the first time for Frank Kaminsky and PJ Dozier to play for KK Partizan in their home court in Belgrade, Serbia. This memory will surely be unforgettable for them.

KK Partizan dominated the game with a 30-point lead (93-63) against their opponent, Baloncesto Fuenlabrada from Spain.
