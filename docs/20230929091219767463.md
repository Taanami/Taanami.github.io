 NBA player Rudy Gay has agreed to a one-year contract with the Warriors. He will compete with other players for a spot on the team's official roster. If he makes the final roster, it will be Gay's 18th NBA season.

Last season, Gay played for the Jazz, averaging only 5.2 points and 2.9 rebounds per game. Throughout his career, he has played for five teams (Grizzlies, Raptors, Kings, Spurs, Jazz) in a total of 17 seasons, averaging 15.8 points and 5.6 rebounds per game. He chose to exercise his player option for the 2023-24 season, continuing to fight for his 18th season, but was traded by the Jazz and Hawks, and later waived by the Thunder.
