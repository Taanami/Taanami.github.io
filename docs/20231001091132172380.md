On Friday, the United States and Germany played a thrilling game in the quarterfinals, with both teams scoring unusually high points in recent FIBA international matches, each scoring at least 110 points. In the end, Germany secured their ticket to the finals with a slight 2-point lead, thanks to Obst's crucial three-pointer. The German team includes several NBA players, with the most famous being Dennis Schroder, who has played for teams such as the Hawks, Thunder, and Lakers. Before the semifinals, Schroder expressed his thoughts on the game, saying that he was happy to face the United States on the World Cup stage and looking forward to facing his former teammate Austin Reaves.

After the game on Friday, Schroder and Reaves embraced tightly, showing their strong friendship. Reaves, after changing his outfit, went to the German team's locker room to once again congratulate Schroder and congratulate them on reaching the final. Schroder also posted a special message yesterday, documenting this moment and stating that tears almost welled up in his eyes when he saw Reaves.
