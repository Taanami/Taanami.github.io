  P.LEAGUE I am not afraid of facing reality as a Dreamer

 The four consecutive wins in the preseason mean nothing, the real challenge begins after the season starts. Jamie Pearlman, the head coach of the Formosa Dreamers, expressed this at the season opening press conference. In the first game of the season, held at their home court in Changhua, the Dreamers failed to hold on to their halftime lead and were overtaken by the opponent's outside shooting in the second half. They ultimately lost 93-101 to the Kaohsiung 17 Live Ironmen, missing out on their first home win.

In their first season in the P.LEAGUE+, Changhua was their home court, but due to venue renovations, they moved to the Taichung Intercontinental Mini Egg for their home games. This year, the team has adopted a dual home court model, with 10 home games each in Taichung and Changhua, showcasing their ambition to manage the central region.

 The first game of the season for the Dreamers was against the visiting Kaohsiung 17 Live Ironmen. Both teams have new head coaches this season. The Ironmen lost their first game to the Taipei Fubon Braves last week and will be playing two consecutive away games this week.

 The Dreamers hoped to get their first win at home and start the season with a bang. In the game, they had a 16-0 run in the second quarter and led 50-44 at halftime. In the second half, Lu Zhengru, who excels in both long-range and close-range shots, including 5 three-pointers, scored 22 points, a new season high, leading the Ironmen to a victory on the road and their first win of the season.

 After the game, Ironmen head coach Qiu Dazong, who has been working with Lu Zhengru since his time at Guanghua High School in 2009, praised him, saying he has been watching him play since he was young and is now a fan of him.

 Qiu Dazong also commended Lu Zhengru for his ability to score and keep the team stable when the score is close or when the team is struggling. Lu Zhengru, who played a crucial role in the Ironmen's victory, responded to his coach by saying they have been working together for a long time, and he has been a fan of Qiu Dazong since he was young. He humbly attributed their win to following the coach's instructions and preparing well before the game.

The Dreamers' head coach, Jamie Pearlman, believes that starting the season with a loss is not a good result, but it is a good learning experience for the team. He also told the players after the game that the long season has just begun, and although losing is disappointing, it is a process that requires teamwork and adjustments to find the best way for the team to play.

 Julian Boyd, who returned to the team, had the best performance for the Dreamers with a team-high 30 points. "Big B" Gilberto also had a double-double with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Although Xin Woke, Lin Jungi, and Michael Calder all scored in double digits, they were unable to defeat the opponent. After the game, Boyd said he was happy to be back with the team, but unfortunately, they lost their first game of the season. Although he scored the most points for the team, his shooting percentage was not good. As the coach said, this is just the first game of the season, and there is still a long way to go. They need to work harder in many areas.

After the game, head coach Pearlman said that they used more zone defense than they planned, and the opponent took advantage of the pick-and-roll to create open shots. These are all part of the team's growth, and he believes that zone defense will be beneficial for the Dreamers this season.

 Additionally, Coach Pearlman mentioned that some players were slow to warm up. Although they had a good free throw percentage (32 out of 40), when they were leading or when the opponent started to catch up, they became hesitant or took forced shots. These are things that they need to face as a team and know where they need to improve.
