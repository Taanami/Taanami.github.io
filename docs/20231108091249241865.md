  The Charlotte Hornets' Floor and Ceiling for the New Season

The Charlotte Hornets had a rough season in 2022-23, but looking at the bright side, they may just be temporarily at the bottom of the league. After all, just two years ago they were a 43-win team and with a healthier roster and fewer off-court distractions, they have the potential to return to that level. LaMelo Ball, who only played 36 games due to ankle injuries last season, should be fully recovered, and Miles Bridges, who missed the entire year due to a domestic violence incident, has re-signed with the team after accepting a qualifying offer. With the addition of Brandon Miller, the second overall pick in this year's draft, the Hornets' roster is almost identical to two years ago.

Health is always a concern for every team, and for the Hornets, it has been an even bigger issue when it comes to their young guards. However, the focus of this article is on the non-health factors and X-factor players that will play a crucial role in the team's success this season. The Hornets' goal is to return to the top of the Eastern Conference standings, which is a big leap from last year, but their overall talent has improved even without major offseason acquisitions. Let's continue reading to explore the biggest question: What can rookie Brandon Miller contribute? As the second overall pick, he will surely garner a lot of attention, especially considering he was drafted ahead of Scoot Henderson, who is expected to be a key player for the Portland Trail Blazers. Miller won't have the same role as Henderson, so how he adapts to the role given to him by the Hornets will be crucial for the team's success in the regular season.

The Hornets' wing rotation may be a bit chaotic, especially after Miles Bridges returns from his 10-game suspension (though his recent violation of a protection order may affect his eligibility). How Miller handles the unstable playing time and adjusts to a lesser role will be a major challenge in his first year in the NBA. However, Miller's offensive abilities are highly appealing, and there's a reason why the Hornets selected him with the second pick. They can utilize his shooting skills and combine them with LaMelo Ball's creativity. If everything goes well, this Hornets team should be better than last year.

However, very few rookies have a smooth season, especially when they're still trying to adapt to a new role. If Miller can't find his own way, it will be interesting to see how head coach Steve Clifford handles the situation. The team wants to be competitive, but sometimes letting a rookie learn from mistakes can go against that goal.

X-Factor: Mark Williams

The Hornets have been searching for a suitable center for years, drafting one big man after another in the first round, but never finding the right fit. However, Mark Williams may finally change that.

Williams had a strong finish to the last season and was even a starter in the second half of the year after the Hornets traded away Mason Plumlee. Clifford favors Williams' defensive contributions, as his teams are known for their strong interior defense.

The Hornets don't have many elite defenders on their roster, making Williams' ability to protect the paint especially valuable. Williams may not be a huge offensive threat, but if he can team up with Ball and Terry Rozier in pick-and-roll situations, his presence could open up opportunities for their outside shooters and relieve some of the offensive burden on Williams.

His continued development will be crucial for the Hornets to achieve their goal this season, as they urgently need a stable and versatile center to execute Clifford's defensive strategy. P.J. Washington has played both power forward and center in the past, but he played almost no role in the center rotation under Clifford last year, which is not surprising given his lack of size for the position and his subpar rim protection skills.

However, this also means that young centers like Williams and Nick Richards will have enough opportunities to step up and prove themselves, and the team will heavily rely on their performances at the center position. It's both pressure and opportunity for these young players.
