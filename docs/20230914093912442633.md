 The 2023 NBA Draft took place at the Barclays Center in New York yesterday. The top three picks each had their own unique characteristics. Victor Wembanyama, also known as the "French Monster," lived up to expectations by being selected as the first overall pick by the San Antonio Spurs. Standing at 7 feet 5 inches (226 cm) tall with an 8-foot wingspan (243 cm), Wembanyama's physical attributes make him a highly coveted prospect. Additionally, he possesses the shooting ability of a guard and the mobility of a forward, making him the undisputed top choice for the draft.

Wembanyama becomes the third number one pick in Spurs history, following in the footsteps of David Robinson in 1987 and Tim Duncan in 1997. Both of these legendary centers helped the Spurs win NBA championships.

Now, the responsibility falls on Wembanyama's shoulders. The Spurs have won the NBA championship five times in their history, with the most recent one coming in the 2013-14 season. In light of Wembanyama's arrival, the Spurs have decided to extend the contract of their 74-year-old legendary head coach, Gregg Popovich, for another three years. They hope to rely on his experience coaching French stars like Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to help Wembanyama adapt quickly to the intensity and lifestyle of the NBA.

After being selected as the top pick, Wembanyama couldn't help but shed tears of joy. In an interview with ESPN, he said, "When I heard the NBA commissioner announce my name, it felt like my lifelong dream was coming true. I've dreamt about this moment so many times, which is why I cried."

The second overall pick, Brandon Miller, stands at 6 feet 9 inches (205 cm) tall and possesses elite 3D physical attributes. He is the only player among the top three picks who played college basketball in the United States. Although he was chosen by the Charlotte Hornets, ESPN reported that during his tryout with the Hornets, Miller told the team owner and basketball legend Michael Jordan that Jordan wasn't his idol, and he hadn't watched much of Jordan's games. Miller's journey to becoming the second pick was filled with twists and turns. Just a year ago, he was projected to be a second-round pick or even go undrafted. However, Miller improved his skills and played for the University of Alabama, where he became a top seed in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. This propelled Miller's draft stock into the lottery range.

However, in February of this year, Miller was unexpectedly involved in a shooting incident with a college teammate. Although he was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, it nearly jeopardized his basketball career.

At just 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) tall, Jaden Hudson had a good chance of being this year's top pick if not for Wembanyama. He is known for his excellent passing vision, explosive athleticism, and leadership qualities on the court. Aside from needing to improve his three-point shooting, he has few weaknesses and is likely to become a highly regarded rookie in the league.

Hudson played in 19 games, all as a starter, in the development league this year. He averaged 16.5 points and 6.8 assists per game, but his three-point shooting percentage was only 27.5%.

It remains to be seen whether the Portland Trail Blazers, who selected Hudson, will initiate a trade involving their star player Damian Lillard or if they will pair him with Hudson to form a backcourt duo. Only time will tell.
