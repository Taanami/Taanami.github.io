 Proud of the Li Family: NBA player Kyle Anderson becomes China's first naturalized basketball player

On the 24th, the Chinese Basketball Association announced that Kyle Anderson, who currently plays for the NBA's Timberwolves, has officially gained Chinese citizenship, becoming China's first naturalized foreign basketball player. He also announced on social media that he will wear the Chinese national team jersey and compete in the FIBA Basketball World Cup in August. Kyle Anderson was born in Fairview, New Jersey, USA. He was selected by the Spurs in the first round, 30th overall, in the 2014 NBA Draft and played for them for four years.

He has played for the Spurs, Grizzlies, and Timberwolves throughout his career. Anderson is 206 cm tall and weighs 104 kg, with an impressive wingspan of 220 cm.

In the previous season, he played for the Timberwolves in 69 games, averaging 9.4 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.9 blocks per game. He had an all-around performance with a three-point shooting percentage of 41% and a field goal percentage of 50.9%.

In international competitions, Anderson has previously participated in the training camps for the U16 and U17 US teams but has never represented the US in games. This fits FIBA's criteria for naturalized players, giving him the opportunity to switch national teams and compete for China.

Anderson's connection with China comes from his mother's heritage. His great-grandfather was a Chinese immigrant, giving him one-eighth Chinese ancestry.

Five years ago, in 2018, he embarked on a journey to China with his mother to explore his roots and left the name "Li Kai'er" in the family genealogy. It was then that the Chinese Basketball Association actively pursued Anderson to become a naturalized player. After announcing his Chinese citizenship on the 24th, Anderson shared his journey of becoming a Chinese citizen on Weibo with the username "Da Hammer Li Kai'er."

He recalled that the root-seeking trip in 2018 was very important to him as it showed him where his roots lie and how deep they go. He also expressed pride and honor in having his name written in the Li family genealogy.

He also announced on social media that he will represent the Chinese national team in the upcoming FIBA Basketball World Cup in August. The post shared by FIBA Basketball World Cup (@fibawc) about Anderson becoming Li Kai'er, China's first naturalized basketball player, has been widely commented on. It is seen as not only a change in China's basketball style but also an accelerator for the transformation of Chinese basketball.

Sports commentator Li Yishen believes that Anderson has a well-rounded playing style, with the ability to handle the ball, control the game, and pass. He has a high basketball IQ and can activate China's interior offense and defense with his height and playmaking abilities.

Especially since China lacks power and restraining ability in the interior, Anderson's addition can help the tall players inside, create space, organize passes, and create scoring opportunities. However, Anderson's unique playing style and slow pace may require time to integrate into China's playing system. In the end, Li Yishen believes that Anderson is not the solution for the Chinese men's basketball team. Although he is unique, he is not an NBA superstar who can dominate Asian opponents with his ball handling and individual skills. China needs top-notch coaches and improvements in player skills, physical fitness, and training systems.
