# The three-way Damian Lillard trade case, which has been in the spotlight for nearly three months, has finally come to a conclusion 
 The three-way Damian Lillard trade case, which has been in the spotlight for nearly three months, has finally come to a conclusion. The Milwaukee Bucks acquired Lillard as their new player by giving up Jrue Holiday, Grayson Allen, a 2029 first-round pick, and two additional first-round picks in exchange. The Phoenix Suns also got involved in the trade by sending Deandre Ayton in return for Jusuf Nurkic, Nassir Little, Keon Johnson, and Grayson Allen. The Portland Trail Blazers, the main seller among the three teams, are highly likely to not keep Holiday and will seek another buyer. As for the other two teams, their acquisitions may not be considered significant upgrades. While Holiday may have a gap in offensive skills compared to Lillard, he is a rare point guard in the league with top-notch defensive abilities and is still capable of contributing on offense. Ayton's presence on the court may have been lower due to his draft position and salary, but he is not necessarily worse than the players they received in return. However, this three-way trade is actually a win-win-win situation, as it is not solely about the players' abilities but rather meets the current needs of all three teams.

In acquiring Lillard, the Bucks gained a player who can provide stability and contribute to their postseason aspirations for the next four years. Before discussing the Bucks' situation, it is important to emphasize a trend that has emerged under the new collective bargaining agreement: the number of star players entering the free agency market is decreasing, to the point where it is almost non-existent. This trend was established after 2019, and the new CBA has only furthered this trend.

Since Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, and D’Angelo Russell in 2019, only two non-minimum contract free agents, Gordon Hayward in 2020 and DeMar DeRozan in 2021, have changed teams in free agency among players who have previously been All-Stars. Other star players have either re-signed with their current teams through early extensions, re-signed as free agents, or been traded before their previous contracts expired. The main reason for this phenomenon is that there are fewer teams capable of creating significant salary cap space to sign players, and even if there are, they are usually not competitive teams. With the new CBA introducing the hard cap line, teams will find it even more difficult to create enough salary cap space. Therefore, star players who have friction with their current teams or are uncertain about their next contract tend to request trades in order to join a team that needs them more and secure a new contract without salary cap restrictions.

But what happens to star players who cannot reach an agreement with their current teams and do not have a desired destination? We have seen two cases this summer: James Harden forcing a trade after exercising a low-priced player option with the Brooklyn Nets and D’Angelo Russell accepting a low-priced contract from the Los Angeles Lakers before waiting for a subsequent trade opportunity. In simple terms, if a star player cannot stay with a team that truly needs them and cannot be traded before their contract expires, they only have the option of taking a pay cut.

Holiday has his own issues, as he has never performed well in the postseason throughout his career except for the 2017-18 season with the New Orleans Pelicans. During his three years with the Bucks in the playoffs, he has averaged 17.9 points, a 3-point percentage of only 0.304, and an eFG% of 0.453. Moreover, he takes about 3.5 more shots per game in the playoffs compared to the regular season. Considering his salary and regular-season performance, it can be said that his playoff performance has been severely underwhelming.

Both Holiday and Lillard are 33 years old, with their birthdays only a month apart. In terms of health, Lillard may appear to be in worse condition, but that is mainly due to his early career workload. Aside from the 2021-22 season when Lillard suffered a more serious injury, the two players are relatively comparable.

Lillard's playoff performance is slightly inferior to his regular-season performance, but not to the extent seen with Holiday. Lillard has also had multiple instances of heroics in clutch moments, which adds an important weapon for the Bucks in the postseason. However, apart from the difference in their playoff performances, another key aspect of this trade is the contract situation.

Giannis Antetokounmpo will turn 29 in the upcoming season, and he has two years remaining on his guaranteed contract, with a player option in 2025-26. Given his importance and symbolic significance to the Bucks, it is almost certain that he will sign a max contract extension ahead of his next contract. The Bucks will only consider the need for a change in direction after his next contract expires. However, his current primary supporting cast consists of Brook Lopez (35 years old), Holiday (33 years old), and Kris Middleton (32 years old). Their best-case scenario is to support Giannis for the next 2-3 years, until his current contract ends. After that, they will inevitably face a wave of changes in the supporting cast. With Lillard's contract extending until 2027, the Bucks can stagger the timeline for rebuilding their supporting cast. They won't have to find replacements for three positions within one or two years or endure a sudden decline. Of course, Lillard will also experience decline, but the Bucks can seek opportunities to strengthen the team from other positions.
