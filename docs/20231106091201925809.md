  NBA player Grant Williams of the Dallas Mavericks gave an interview where he talked about his interactions with Jayson Tatum's son Deuce in the locker room. Williams recalls a time when he was trying to give high fives to all the players, but Deuce ignored him and went off with Tatum. This has happened more than once.

"I have no problems with Deuce," laughed Grant Williams.

"Deuce is like my little brother, that's just our love-hate relationship. It's funny between us. Deuce is growing up and he's starting to talk now."

"One day I was with Tatum and Deuce was there too. I said to Deuce, 'Brother, you're in kindergarten now. You're growing up and you won't see me anymore.'"

"Then Deuce replied, 'You went to the Mavericks because I'm in kindergarten?'"

"It's sad to leave Deuce. It's strange when kids grow up because they act like they don't like you, but I know he'll miss me."
