 NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo recently came out in support of track and field athlete Noah Lyles, who has faced criticism for referring to himself as a "world champion" after winning in the NBA. In a podcast interview, Giannis defended Lyles and agreed with his message, stating that he believes Lyles has received too much negative backlash.

Giannis used the example of soccer to illustrate his point, saying that even when a team wins the Champions League, they do not refer to themselves as "world champions" because there are many other countries and leagues in the world. He also added that while the NBA may be the best league in basketball, it is important to respect other leagues and their champions.

Giannis acknowledged that his words may also receive backlash, but he stands by his belief and supports Lyles. Lyles himself has also addressed the controversy, saying that he stands by his statement and hopes for consistency in how "world champions" are treated in the country. He also highlighted the lack of attention and understanding towards track and field in comparison to other sports.
