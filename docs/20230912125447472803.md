 Former PLG Hsinchu Reapers player Pan Guanhan was ordered to pay NT$200,000 in compensation for cheating on his wife. Pan Guanhan's wife filed for divorce and requested an additional NT$500,000 in compensation. Taipei District Court granted the divorce and ruled that Pan Guanhan must pay an additional NT$200,000. The case can be appealed.

Pan Guanhan, a former player for the Hsinchu Reapers, was previously exposed for having an affair with a female fan, and it was revealed that he intended to force his wife and child out of their home. The team immediately announced his release after the news came out.

The model wife also filed a lawsuit and demanded joint compensation of NT$500,000 from Pan Guanhan and the female fan. Taipei District Court initially ruled for NT$250,000 in compensation, but upon further consideration of the extramarital affair, the court changed the ruling to NT$300,000. Pan Guanhan's wife, who is a pharmacist and model, claimed that they got married in March 2018, but Pan Guanhan started a relationship with the female fan in February 2021. They referred to each other as husband and wife and exchanged messages such as "We haven't had sex for five days, can't get wet, lost charm, lost desire" and "I just want you." The wife believed that Pan Guanhan's interaction with the female fan had harmed their marriage and therefore sued for joint compensation of NT$500,000.

The lawyer jointly appointed by Pan Guanhan and the female fan stated that Pan Guanhan had to live in the team dormitory after getting married due to work reasons, which often led to arguments with his wife. In order to support his wife's social media career, Pan Guanhan frequently traveled between Taipei and Hsinchu. His wife had previously requested a divorce multiple times, and their marriage had long been in decline. Pan Guanhan admitted to having sexual relations with someone else but claimed that he and his wife had grown apart and their marriage was already deteriorating. He also argued that his wife was at fault and that the court had already ruled for him to pay NT$300,000 in compensation, so she could not request further compensation. Pan Guanhan agreed to the divorce, but he saw no reason for further compensation.

Taipei District Court determined that Pan Guanhan's sexual relations with the female fan violated his spouse's rights and had already been ruled upon in another case. The court acknowledged that the wife had valid reasons to request a divorce and granted the divorce. The court recognized the significant emotional distress the wife had suffered due to Pan Guanhan's consensual sexual relations with others. The wife revealed that Pan Guanhan is currently running a barbecue snack shop with friends, earning around NT$50,000 to NT$60,000 per month.

Considering Pan's current situation, Taipei District Court ruled that he must pay an additional NT$200,000 in compensation to his wife.
