 In tonight's preseason game, New Taipei Kings player Lin Li-jen was ejected from the game due to a fake fall and a technical foul. In the post-game press conference, he mentioned that this was a first for him in his basketball career. One of the fouls was caused by his teammate Jun-nan, but fortunately, there was no fine or suspension for the preseason game. Lin also talked about his three consecutive three-pointers in the fourth quarter, which caused the crowd to cheer loudly again. The cheers were almost as loud as those for Jeremy Lin, and Lin Li-jen attributed it to the fact that Taiwan has many basketball fans and his last name is also "Lin," so he may have some added cheering support in Taiwan.

Jeremy Lin also praised Lin Li-jen's performance today, saying that his three-pointers were beautiful and determined, but he may have gotten too excited and impulsive when he got ejected. The Kings lost today's game, but they have another game tomorrow against Ironmen. Jeremy Lin said he won't be playing in tomorrow's game, and his younger brother, Lin Shu-wei, will take his place.
