 The PLG Yulon Luxgen Dinos announced today (9/5) that they have completed the contract extension with center Jason Washburn. Washburn joined the Luxgen Dinos last season and played in 26 regular season games with an average playing time of 33 minutes. He had a field goal percentage of over 50% and averaged 21.3 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. He was a key player in the Dinos' ten-game winning streak. After the end of last season, the team actively negotiated the contract extension with Washburn and recently completed the signing. Washburn said, "I can't wait to get back on the court and win every game for the Dinos. I'm also happy to fight alongside my teammates." The team stated, "Washburn is a player who balances rationality and emotion. In addition to his excellent basketball skills, all Dinos will not forget the tears he shed when the team's record was not good last season. This kind of determination and pride are driving the team's growth. We are very happy that Washburn is returning, and we believe that his addition will help the Luxgen Dinos achieve even better results."
