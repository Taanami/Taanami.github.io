 Jeremy Lin Confirmed to Join PLG Kaohsiung Steel in Taiwan, Supports the Great Southern Project to Address the Imbalance in Taiwan's Basketball Scene

PLG Kaohsiung Steel announced today that Taiwanese former NBA star Jeremy Lin will be joining the team. Lin, who is currently in the United States, posted a photoshopped image of himself wearing the number 7 jersey on social media with the caption, "Kaohsiung, I'm coming." Rumors of Lin joining the Taiwanese professional basketball league have been circulating since the end of last year, but the team had not confirmed until now. The announcement by P. LEAGUE+ Kaohsiung Steel on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year has once again made a splash in Taiwan's basketball scene. The 2022-23 season of the Taiwanese professional basketball league is full of surprises. The Taoyuan Yongfeng Clouded Leopards of the neighboring Taiwan xT1 League first brought in "The Beast" Dwight Howard, an eight-time NBA All-Star. Now, PLG has also recruited the highly popular Jeremy Lin in Taiwan, creating a situation where two star players will face off. 

News of Lin's return to Taiwan to play basketball had been circulating since last year, but at that time, he was still playing for the Guangzhou Loong Lions in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). It wasn't until the end of last year when he announced his decision to leave the CBA that his return to Taiwan gained attention once again. Lin's younger brother, Lin Shu-wei, currently plays for the New Taipei Kings, a team ranking high in the PLG standings. Lin Shu-wei has expressed his desire to play alongside his brother during their professional careers. Although they won't be playing on the same team, they will soon have the opportunity to compete against each other in the same league, taking a big step towards their "union."

In addition to posting a photo of himself wearing the Kaohsiung Steel jersey on social media, Lin also wrote, "Kaohsiung, I'm coming." Many fans have shown their support online, with one fan writing, "Welcome to Kaohsiung, the people of Kaohsiung will support you to the end." Another fan wrote, "Taiwan welcomes you back to play basketball," expressing their joy and support for Lin's return. P. LEAGUE+ Kaohsiung Steel officially announced the recruitment of Taiwanese basketball star Jeremy Lin. Lin identifies with the team's "Great Southern Project" which aims to address the long-standing imbalance between the north and south of Taiwan's basketball scene, and he hopes to contribute to the Kaohsiung Steel's success.

Lin, who sparked "Linsanity" in the NBA, has played in top professional leagues such as the NBA and CBA for many years. He terminated his contract with the CBA's Beijing Ducks at the end of last year and decided to return to Taiwan after the Lunar New Year. Lin's NBA journey was not without its challenges. Although he signed contracts with the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, he did not have much playing time and had to make several trips in and out of the development league. It wasn't until 2012 when he joined the New York Knicks that he seized the opportunity and scored a career-high 25 points, along with 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals, leading the team to end their losing streak and capturing the attention of fans. In subsequent games, Lin continued to deliver impressive performances, achieving double-double statistics against star guards like John Wall and scoring a career-high 38 points against the late Kobe Bryant. The "Linsanity" phenomenon became a hot topic in the global basketball community, and Lin even appeared on the cover of TIME magazine and was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012.

After nearly 10 years of playing in the NBA, Lin won the championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019 and then joined the CBA's Beijing Ducks, averaging 22.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. Wherever Lin went, whether it was as a home or away player, he attracted a full house and became the center of attention. He terminated his contract at the end of last year and joined the Kaohsiung Steel after the Lunar New Year. The Kaohsiung Steel team stated in a press release that the "Linsanity" phenomenon was not a coincidence. In addition to Lin's high level of self-discipline and determination, he never gave up and was always ready to seize opportunities. When the New York Knicks were in a losing streak, Lin took advantage of the opportunity and led the team to overcome adversity, achieving a winning streak and entering the playoffs, proving himself with actual performance. The team sees parallels between Lin's situation back then and the current situation of the Kaohsiung Steel. 

After joining the Kaohsiung Steel, Jeremy Lin is expected to become the team's new offensive weapon, filling the gap in the team's lack of experienced backcourt players. In addition to providing the team with tangible strength, Lin's presence can also provide more support and development opportunities for the team's rising star point guard Chen Yu-wei and versatile guard Wang Lu-xiang.

As the only team in southern Taiwan in the P. LEAGUE+, Kaohsiung Steel joined the league last year and has been actively promoting the "Great Southern Project" in an effort to gradually address the long-standing resource imbalance in Taiwan's basketball scene between the north and south. With Jeremy Lin's addition and support, the Kaohsiung Steel's "Great Southern Project" can take a big step forward.

Jeremy Lin, a devout Christian, has had a longstanding connection with the Fengshan Gymnasium, the home court of the Kaohsiung Steel. In 2016, he shared his life experiences and testimony under the theme of "Lin's Life of Constant Breakthrough" with nearly 5,000 churchgoers and fans, sharing the power of faith in his life. After becoming an NBA player, Lin faced many challenges and discrimination, but he adjusted his pace and bravely faced challenges.

According to GM Gao Jing-yan, the main reason for Jeremy Lin's decision to join the team is his sense of responsibility and mission towards himself and the overall development of basketball. He is well aware that basketball development in Taiwan has always been concentrated in the north, while the south has been relatively less vibrant. He hopes that his joining the team can change the viewing habits of basketball fans in southern Taiwan and bring more resources and change to the southern market.

Jeremy Lin's basketball career has always been about challenging the impossible. When he went undrafted and made it to the NBA as an Asian-American player despite being underestimated, he proved his worth and value. Now, with his decision to join the Kaohsiung Steel, fans are eagerly awaiting whether he can replicate the success of "Linsanity" in the NBA and transform into the team's savior.
