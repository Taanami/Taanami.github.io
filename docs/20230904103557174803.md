# Is Stephen Curry the greatest point guard in NBA history? 


 Is Stephen Curry the greatest point guard in NBA history? I and Magic Johnson should both be discussed in this list," Curry answered when asked by former player Gilbert Arenas if he considered himself the greatest point guard of all time. Both of them burst into laughter. Arenas said, "We can compare the stats. I haven't played during Magic's era, but I know that back then, no one wanted to be a point guard at 6'9". But when we see Curry, we see every kid wanting to be like him. Curry has had a tremendous impact on the game of basketball. "We can look at the stats and differentiate between Curry and Magic, but in terms of influence, Curry far surpasses Magic. Just look at those who play AAU basketball," Arenas added.

Curry himself responded, "I have to answer this question with both of them being the greatest point guards. But Magic's career achievements are incredible, and I never thought about comparing myself to him. But as host Arenas said, it's interesting to compare who's better. These discussions are what make sports fascinating, and it's why we all love watching. I enjoy it myself."
