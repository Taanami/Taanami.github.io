Former Kaohsiung Steel basketball star Jeremy Lin, who had an outstanding performance in the previous PLG season, had various rumors circulating during the off-season about his next move. This included offers from Chinese teams, with the possibility of returning to the CBA. Whether he would stay in Taiwan to continue his fight with the Steel alongside the people of Kaohsiung, or fulfill his wish to play with his younger brother by joining the New Taipei Kings, both scenarios were possible. However, earlier today, Jeremy Lin personally announced that he will be joining the New Taipei Kings, continuing his basketball journey in Taiwan for the new season.

Last season, Jeremy Lin made a high-profile mid-season transfer to the Kaohsiung Steel, transforming them from a bottom-ranked team to playoff contenders. Although he suffered an injury during a crucial battle and ultimately missed the playoffs, his remarkable performance during that time allowed fans to experience the charm of "Linsanity" firsthand. Welcome back, Jeremy! In the previous season, Lin played 19 games, averaging 26.3 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.
