  202324 Season Analysis: Can Tainan Taiwan Steel Eagles Return to Three-Tower Lineup and Make it to the Finals Again?

Last season, the Eagles were arguably the most improved team in the entire league. Going from a record of 6 wins and 24 losses in their first season to making it to the finals, although they were swept by the champions, it was still a very successful season for the Eagles. But after a summer break, can this three-tower lineup lead the team back to the finals or even win the championship? Last season, the three towers combined for an average of 61.4 points and 36.1 rebounds per game. Among them, Ares (Robert Upshaw III) was the most important. After joining the Eagles last season, he averaged 21.8 points, 12 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game in 25 games. What's more important is that he attempted 5.6 three-pointers per game and had a 35% shooting percentage. Although this shooting percentage is not high, it is rare for a 213cm tall center to provide important firepower from both the inside and outside, making him the most indispensable tower in the three-tower lineup.

However, from the two official warm-up games and the league's opening game, the Eagles' proud "Lalashan" connection no longer seems familiar to everyone.

However, after a summer break, Ares not only suffered an injury in an NBL game and announced on IG that he would end his remaining NBL season because his teammate Deguara played too dirty, but also did not play in the official warm-up game organized by the league. The coach Liu Mengzhu explained that he simply hoped that Ares could prepare for the opening game in good health. However, Ares performed poorly in the opening game. Apart from the obvious physical changes, he only played for 12 minutes and missed both of his shots, with a terrible stat line of 0 points and 8 rebounds. If Ares cannot quickly regain his physical and game feel, it will undoubtedly cause significant damage to the entire team.

Although he had a performance of 14 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 blocks in the warm-up game and a shooting percentage of 66.7%, he still showed signs of physical changes. Among the three players, only Deguara seems to have maintained or even improved his performance. He scored 45 points against the War Gods in the warm-up game and nearly achieved a double-double of 22 points and 19 rebounds in the opening game against the Special Attack. He posed a threat to the War Gods in the first two quarters. However, as the game went on, it could be seen that Deguara's stamina was not enough to dominate the game. Moreover, it is obvious that the team or Deguara himself hopes to at least improve their speed. Therefore, he had to use more energy to run in this game compared to last season, and the Eagles lost to the Special Attack once again. Eagles' problems remain: No outside shooting, no playmaking Just from this opening game, it can be seen that the Eagles have not solved the problems they had last season. Although they have acquired several players, including Sun's descendants such as Su Yijin, and a foreign player with good scoring ability, Kim-Eun, the team still lacks a stable outside shooter and a playmaking guard. The team's three-point shooting percentage was only 34.4%, with 15 assists and 24 turnovers, indicating that the Eagles will only have a worse record than last season if they continue to play like this. Moreover, this three-point shooting percentage was only achieved because Kim-Eun made 5 of his 8 attempts. However, Kim-Eun's three-point shooting percentage was less than 30% last season, so it is almost impossible for him to maintain this percentage in future games.

Picture source/ T1 League It will be very difficult to change the playing style with just Kim-Eun Coach Liu Mengzhu once said in an interview that after Kim-Eun joined the team, we might see less of the "Lalashan" lineup, because he hopes to improve the team's speed in both offense and defense this season. This is a good idea and direction, and also the only place where we can see the Eagles trying to solve their weaknesses from last season. In the opening game, it can also be seen that the Eagles do want to push the ball quickly after securing rebounds, but it resulted in consecutive turnovers. In the second half, it can also be seen that the players still wanted to pass the ball into the paint, but as Deguara's stamina decreased, this strategy only resulted in more turnovers. The congested paint also made it impossible for the frontcourt players to make backdoor cuts. The lack of a plan for outside shooting and finishing point also caused turnovers even when the team tried to make passes at the top of the arc. Please continue reading.
