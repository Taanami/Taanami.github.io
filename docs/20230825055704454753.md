  PLG legislator calls out Taishin Bank for maliciously poaching Lin Ping-sheng from Attack Lions, still hopes for a negotiated resolution

August 18, 2023, 10:56 am, United Daily News/ Reporter Liu Zhao-yu/ Taipei Immediate Report - Attack Lions held a press conference today with the presence of legislators.

Attack Lions, a team from the PLG Hsinchu Street League, recently encountered a contract dispute with Lin Ping-sheng. Today, legislator Lin Wei-zhou specially held a press conference to express concerns and stated that T1 League newcomer Taishin Bank is the team behind the poaching of Lin Ping-sheng. After Attack Lions officially announced Lin Ping-sheng's joining, he contradicted it on his personal social media, announcing his refusal to join. Today, the Attack Lions team also held a press conference with legislator Lin Wei-zhou, during which consultant Chen Zhi-zhong mentioned that Lin Ping-sheng had approached Attack Lions on May 25 expressing his willingness to join. After reaching a consensus, Attack Lions informed New Taipei CTBC Attack Team, with whom Lin Ping-sheng had a contract at the time. CTBC Attack also requested a quote from Attack Lions before deciding whether to match it, and later Attack Lions successfully signed a contract with Lin Ping-sheng. Chen Zhi-zhong also revealed that in late May and early June, Lin Ping-sheng had contract issues with a Chinese basketball team, which prevented him from being available for national team selection. At that time, he asked Attack Lions for help in resolving the issue, "This also shows that he recognizes himself as a member of Attack Lions. Two weeks ago, he told us that he wants to wear the number 3 jersey, and we discussed with Wang Zi-gang to give it to him, which shows that Attack Lions welcomes him with open arms. I don't know why he suddenly wants to go to other teams these past two weeks."

Representative Hu Long-zhi of Attack Lions Cultural and Creative Co., Ltd. stated that during the period after Lin Ping-sheng signed the contract, both parties continued to add to the contract content. Even when he expressed his desire to join the CBA, we were still making adjustments. However, later he expressed that he didn't want to join, and they couldn't actively approach Taishin Bank since the contract was signed with Attack Lions. "Of course, we still hope to resolve this through negotiation rather than filing a lawsuit. We judge players based on their performance on the court, and we can teach them off the court. This is the principle we uphold." Legislator Lin Wei-zhou also revealed that it is understood that it was Taishin Financial Holding that signed the contract with Lin Ping-sheng. He also faced some pressure before this press conference, hoping that he wouldn't hold it. "Malicious poaching is not regulated. PLG has its own regulations, and T1 also has its own regulations, but the other league's malicious poaching is not subject to PLG regulations, which is not very healthy for the development of both leagues and basketball. The team plays in the season, and halfway through, they are poached. I'll compensate you for the damages as long as you can pay, you'll be poached. What can we do?"
