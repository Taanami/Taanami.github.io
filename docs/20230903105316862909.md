 Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown has signed a record-breaking contract extension with the team, according to a report by ESPN. Brown's new contract is worth $304 million over five years, making it the highest salary in NBA history.

Last season, Brown had a career-high average of 26.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game. He played a key role in helping the Celtics reach the Eastern Conference Finals and was selected for the All-Star Game for the first time. As a result, he earned the eligibility for a max contract extension with the Celtics.

According to reports, Brown was selected by the Celtics as the third overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. His salary for the upcoming season will be $28.5 million, and his new extension will begin in 2024, with his salary increasing each year. He will earn an average of $60.8 million per year, doubling his current value.

Brown's record-breaking contract exceeds the $276 million deal signed by Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic, making it the most lucrative contract in NBA history. Jokic has won the MVP award twice and led the Nuggets to their first NBA championship in the 2022-23 season, earning the NBA Finals MVP title with an average of 30.2 points, 14 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.4 steals per game.

However, Brown's reign as the highest-paid player in the NBA may not last long, as his teammate Jayson Tatum will also be eligible to sign a supermax contract next year. The Celtics' decision to invest heavily in their players is supported by the fact that Brown and Tatum formed a formidable duo last season, averaging a combined 56.7 points per game. Additionally, Brown's scoring efficiency and ability to score without assists have reached new heights.
