#  無論是年輕球員還是經驗豐富的老將，立陶宛隊都擁有一支完整的陣容，他們能夠適應不同的比賽節奏和風格。他們的團隊合作能力是他們在世界盃中取得成功的一大因素。

 然而，立陶宛也有一些危險因素，可能會影響到他們在世界盃的表現。首先，他們的陣容深度可能會成為一個問題。隨著球員退役和退出國家隊，立陶宛的陣容變得相對薄弱，且缺乏替補球員能夠填補空缺。

 其次，他們的球隊還缺乏一名真正的得分手，能夠在比賽的關鍵時刻出手解決問題。儘管有 Brazdeikis 和 Jokubaitis 的出色表現，但他們的經驗和實力仍然有限，無法保證在每場比賽中都能扛起這樣的重任。

最後，立陶宛也需要解決他們的防守問題。他們在世界盃上的防守表現並不出色，尤其是在內線防守方面。如果他們無法改善防守，對手很可能會利用這一點來獲得優勢。

總的來說，立陶宛是一支非常有潛力的球隊，他們在世界盃中表現出色，但仍然有一些危險因素可能會影響到他們的表現。他們需要在比賽中保持團隊合作，解決陣容深度和防守方面的問題，才能真正成為一匹黑馬，爭取世界盃的勝利。Lithuania is undoubtedly one of the dark horses in this year's World Cup

A few months ago, they were ranked 15th by FIBA and managed to beat several strong teams, including the United States. Even in their own country, no one expected them to achieve such results this year.

Now, let's get to know Lithuania, the Eastern European team that has performed exceptionally well in this year's World Cup.

Keep reading "Who's Next?" This was the reaction of Lithuania's top player Jonas Valanciunas, on the Instagram account of BasketNews, after former assistant coach Kestutis Kemzura resigned a few weeks before the start of the training camp. Valanciunas has not missed any major FIBA international tournament in the past 16 years.

Therefore, when another teammate chose not to attend the national team's training camp, he expressed his frustration.

Lithuania could have formed a team with all the top players, but players like Domantas Sabonis, Marius Grigonis, Rokas Giedraitis, Edgaras Ulanovas, Arnas Butkevicius, Lukas Lekavicius, and Arturas Gudaitis all declined to represent Lithuania in the World Cup for various reasons.

However, the remaining players have become a perfect example that big-name players do not always guarantee the best results, and vice versa. Despite the disappointment of Sabonis, a top Lithuanian player, choosing not to participate in the World Cup, it has relieved head coach Kazys Maksvytis in a way.

He no longer has to worry about how to make Valanciunas and Sabonis work together on the court, as no coach has been able to successfully pair these two NBA players in the past, which has been proven in previous international games. Valanciunas became the main threat in the low post, ensuring points in the paint.

In the World Cup, he lived up to expectations, averaging 14.5 points (with an impressive 69.2% shooting percentage), 11 rebounds, and 1.5 assists, with a very efficient performance. He was also selected for the second team after the tournament ended.

Keep reading Before the World Cup, the 22-year-old Jokubaitis did not fully live up to the expectations and potential he had been recognized for in recent years. He also struggled in the first game against Egypt, scoring only 2 points and going 0-for-6 from the field, with three turnovers.

However, he quickly bounced back like an experienced star. In the next three games against Mexico, Montenegro, and Greece, Jokubaitis averaged 17.7 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 6.3 assists, with an impressive efficiency score of 23.3.

In addition, his three-point shooting was also excellent, making 8 out of 7 attempts. Despite being only 22 years old, he was also one of the youngest starting point guards in this tournament, but his teammates admire his ability to control the game and guide the offense. "When I think back to my performance and decision-making at his age, I can only give him great praise because he was able to effectively handle the high-level challenges he faced. He knew very well that if he didn't perform well, we might have a difficult game ahead.

He struggled in his first game, just like last year. But he quickly learned from his mistakes and made progress." Mindaugas Kuzminskas said. With Marius Grigonis withdrawing, Ignas Brazdeikis became the only true scorer who can solve problems in crucial moments, especially when Lithuania needs a 1-on-1 solution in the final moments.

Teammates noticed that Brazdeikis is not a player who likes to force his way to the basket, but rather reads the situation and is willing to share the ball, unlike last year.

The current Brazdeikis is averaging 11.5 points, with a 54.5% shooting percentage from two-point range and an impressive 70% three-point shooting percentage.

He also contributes with an average of 4.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game. His turnovers have reduced from 2.2 turnovers per game in the last EuroBasket to just 1.0 in the World Cup, and his shooting percentage has increased by a surprising 20.7%.

The other players around this core team have also shown their professional skills, whether it's a defensive ace or a versatile veteran. Their team success always takes precedence over individual aspirations. For example, former New York Knicks player Mindaugas Kuzminskas was hardly included in the rotation in the 2019 World Cup and the 2021 Olympic qualifying games.

However, under the guidance of Kazys Maksvytis, he successfully regained his confidence and returned to his normal performance.

As a 33-year-old veteran, Kuzminskas has performed well in the World Cup, averaging 10.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 2.5 assists, with an impressive 75% shooting percentage from two-point range and 46.2% from three-point range. He can also make crucial shots in the game's critical moments.

Regardless of whether they are young players or experienced veterans, the Lithuanian team has a complete lineup, able to adapt to different game rhythms and styles. Their teamwork is a major factor in their success in the World Cup.

However, Lithuania also has some danger factors that may affect their performance in the World Cup. Firstly, their lack of depth in the lineup may become a problem. With players retiring and withdrawing from the national team, Lithuania's lineup has become relatively weak and lacks substitute players who can fill the gaps.

Secondly, their team also lacks a true scorer who can make crucial shots in the game's critical moments. Despite the impressive performances of Brazdeikis and Jokubaitis, their experience and abilities are still limited, and they cannot guarantee to shoulder such a heavy responsibility in every game.

Finally, Lithuania also needs to address their defensive problems. Their defensive performance in the World Cup is not outstanding, especially in defending the inside. If they cannot improve their defense, their opponents may take advantage of this to gain an advantage.

Overall, Lithuania is a very promising team that has performed well in the World Cup, but there are still some danger factors that may affect their performance. They need to maintain teamwork in the game, solve the problems of lineup depth and defense, in order to truly become a dark horse and compete for victory in the World Cup.
