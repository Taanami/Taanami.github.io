  Brown and Celtics sign record-breaking 5-year, $95.2 billion contract extension in NBA history 

 (Central News Agency) The sports channel "ESPN" reported today (25th) that Jaylen Brown, the Boston Celtics' star player in the NBA, has reached an agreement with the team. Brown has been awarded a 5-year, $304 million supermax contract extension, setting a new record for the highest salary in NBA history.

 Brown had a career-high average of 26.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game last season. He was instrumental in leading the Celtics to the Eastern Conference Finals, and he was also selected for the All-Star Game and the All-NBA Second Team for the first time. As a result, he qualified for a 5-year maximum contract extension with the Celtics.

 According to reports from Reuters, Brown was selected by the Celtics as the third overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. He has been selected for the All-Star Game twice and will earn $28.5 million in salary for the upcoming season. Starting in 2024, he will begin his 5-year contract extension, with his salary increasing each year, averaging $60.8 million per year, effectively doubling his net worth.

 Brown's supermax contract amount even exceeds the $276 million contract of Nikola Jokic, the Denver Nuggets' star center, making it the most lucrative contract in NBA history.

 Jokic has won the regular season MVP award twice and led the Nuggets to their first NBA championship in the 2022-23 season. He averaged 30.2 points, 14 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in the NBA Finals, earning the Finals MVP award.

 However, Brown's reign as the NBA's highest-paid player may not last long, as Jayson Tatum will also be eligible to sign a supermax contract extension next year. The Celtics' decision to invest heavily in re-signing Brown can be attributed to the strong duo formed by Brown and Tatum last season, who combined for an average of 56.7 points per game. They scored over 30 points each in 10 games, a feat achieved only by the "O'Bryant Connection" of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the past 30 years. Additionally, according to Second Spectrum, 54% of Brown's scoring last season came from unassisted shots, and he averaged 1.15 points per drive, setting a new career high.
