 The Legacy of German Basketball from Dirk Nowitzki to Dennis Schröder

In the 2023 World Cup, Germany defeated Serbia in the championship game and won the gold medal.

After winning the bronze medal at the 2022 EuroBasket, German basketball once again showcased its strength to the global fans. "We've won the World Cup! This is truly incredible! This team is amazing!" Please continue reading. After winning the World Cup, former NBA player and German basketball legend Dirk Nowitzki congratulated his homeland on achieving this remarkable feat on his social media. This was a height that he had not reached in his 18-year national team career. The biggest contributor to this success was none other than Germany's captain and NBA player Dennis Schröder.

"He won the bronze medal at the EuroBasket, the gold medal at the World Cup, and was named the World Cup MVP." "Everything he has done deserves 100% respect." "The respect that Dirk received in the past is now fully deserved by Schröder." Please continue reading. Over the course of eight games, Schröder averaged 19.1 points, 6.1 assists, and 1.4 steals per game. He not only led Germany to an undefeated gold medal with eight wins, but also scored 30 points and 8 assists against Australia, becoming the second German to score 30 points in an international game after Nowitzki.

No wonder Germany's head coach Gordon Herbert praised Schröder's performance and deserved respect after the game, and Schröder, with such a performance, won the MVP award. "It was a long wait." "We won the bronze medal at the EuroBasket last year, and this year we won the gold medal at the World Cup. I waited for a whole decade." "The coach did a great job in uniting the team." "We achieved the feat of winning all eight games, including strong teams like Georgia and Slovenia." After winning the World Cup MVP, Schröder also emotionally expressed how difficult the journey had been.

Indeed, from 2015 EuroBasket, when Nowitzki passed the torch, to standing at the top of the world basketball in 2023, it was not an easy journey at all. Please continue reading. The Golden Era initiated by Nowitzki In 1997, Nowitzki began representing Germany in international competitions. In an exhibition game, Nowitzki dunked over NBA superstar Charles Barkley, leading Barkley to predict that this young man had the chance to become a superstar in the future.

The following year, Nowitzki was selected into the NBA and with accumulated experience, his performance improved year by year. He brought back the skills he learned to the national team, instantly boosting Germany's strength with Nowitzki. Not only did they win the bronze medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship (later renamed World Cup), but Nowitzki himself also won the MVP and scoring champion titles with an average of 24 points per game.

Later in 2005, Nowitzki led Germany to a silver medal at the EuroBasket. Simply put, Nowitzki at that time was like a German-made tank, with stable quality and powerful firepower. With him, Germany had a solid foundation in terms of basketball strength.

However, as the basketball strength of other countries gradually improved and Nowitzki stopped playing for the national team after the 2008 Olympics, Germany found it increasingly difficult to gain advantages on the world basketball stage. They lost in the 2009 EuroBasket and even had to rely on wildcards to qualify for the World Cup. Even though Nowitzki announced his return to the national team in 2011, it was challenging to return to the past glory of German basketball. After entering the second round, they only won against Turkey and ended their campaign. After the 2011 EuroBasket, Nowitzki retired from the national team once again, and without him, Germany even failed to qualify for the 2012 Olympics. In the 2013 EuroBasket, they were eliminated with a disappointing record of 1 win and 4 losses.

In the 2015 EuroBasket, Nowitzki once again, and for the last time, put on the national team jersey with the goal of achieving good results for Germany, one of the host countries. However, things did not go as planned. The aging Nowitzki was already struggling on the court. They could only win 1 game and were eliminated in the preliminary round with a record of 1 win and 4 losses. Nowitzki announced his retirement from the national team in such a difficult situation. Elimination in the preliminary round and the retirement of the national pillar was a devastating blow to Germany. However, many German fans did not despair because they saw a 21-year-old future hope in this tournament. He became the leading scorer and assist leader for Germany with an average of 21 points and 6 assists per game. He ranked second in scoring and fourth in assists in the tournament. That person is Dennis Schröder. Carrying on the torch of legacy. "If I tell you that Nowitzki is my idol, I must be lying." "I grew up watching games of Mike Conley, Chris Paul, and Tony Parker." "But when I participated in the NBA draft and had a trial in Dallas, Nowitzki gave me his phone number." "Since then, our relationship has been good."
