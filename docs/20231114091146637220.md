On the second day of the quarter-finals of the FIBA World Cup, undefeated Germany faced the dark horse of this year's tournament, Latvia. German star Franz Wagner returned to the court after missing four consecutive games. Despite a poor performance from Dennis Schroder, who only made 4 of 26 shots, Germany managed to secure a narrow 81-79 victory, thanks to a comfortable lead in the first half and a missed three-point shot by Davis Bertans in the final seconds. They will face USA in the semi-finals on Friday.

In the first quarter, Latvia was the stronger team, taking advantage of Germany's struggling offense and building a 13-3 lead with three three-pointers from Davis Bertans. However, Germany, being the undefeated team, quickly adjusted their defensive strategy and started to score through Voigtmann and Franz Wagner's three-pointers. Maodo Lo and Andreas Obst also stepped up to stabilize Germany's offense, as Schroder had a poor first half (0-9 shooting). Germany led by a slim margin of 36-34 at halftime. Both teams' offense picked up in the third quarter, with Schroder finally making his first shot on the 13th attempt and Franz Wagner being more decisive in his plays. Latvia relied on guard Arturs Zagars to initiate their offense, connecting on outside shots and driving to the basket. Bertans continued to be hot from beyond the arc, making two more three-pointers in this quarter.

In the final quarter, Germany decided to rest Schroder and increase their height advantage by having Franz Wagner play as point guard. This proved to be effective as they opened the quarter with an 8-0 run, widening the lead to 11 points. In the middle of the fourth quarter, Latvia made two three-pointers to narrow the gap, while Schroder, who only made 2 of 20 shots, finally scored on a drive. The score was down to 10 points. In the last two minutes, Rodions Kurucs made a three-pointer, and Bertans successfully blocked a shot, followed by Zagars making two difficult layups to score 6 points in a row, bringing the deficit to only 2 points. In the final seconds, Germany's Daniel Theis made two free throws, and Schroder's last drive was blocked. Bertans had a chance to tie the game with a three-pointer, but it missed, and Germany held on to an 81-79 victory, securing their spot in the semi-finals against USA on Friday.

Germany's main point guard Dennis Schroder had a poor performance in this game, with 9 points, 4 assists, 4 turnovers, and 2 steals on 4 of 26 shooting. He also had the worst +/- value of -20, almost dragging down Germany's offense. Fortunately, their lead in the first half was enough to prevent a comeback by Latvia. Franz Wagner, who returned from injury, had a typical performance with 16 points, 8 rebounds, and 3 assists, with a high +/- value of +19. He and his brother Moritz Wagner helped save Germany from defeat, with Moritz scoring 12 points and 4 rebounds.

Latvia's journey in the World Cup ends in the quarter-finals, but their team's fighting spirit was impressive. Arturs Zagars had 24 points and 8 assists, making several crucial left-handed layups to keep the game close. Davis Bertans made six three-pointers, making him a key player for Latvia's chances of winning. They will face Italy in their next game, continuing to fight for the best possible finish in the tournament.
