 Taiwanese basketball player Lin Ping-Sheng denies being the leader of the team despite his outstanding performance in the cross-league basketball game at the Taiwan Shinse Bank Warriors. On September 17, Lin scored a team-high of 24 points for the second consecutive day.

In the first half of the game, the Taiwan Shinse Bank Warriors fell behind, but Lin Ping-Sheng's 24 points in the second half led to a comeback victory of 80-71 against Taiwan Beer. With two consecutive wins, Lin Ping-Sheng attributed the team's success to teamwork, emphasizing that there is no single leader in the team. Despite facing contract disputes with PLG Hsinchu Street Lions, Lin Ping-Sheng remained unaffected on the court. In the first half, the Warriors trailed 33-36, but they staged an 11-1 run in the first five and a half minutes of the third quarter, with Lin Ping-Sheng scoring 9 points. Taiwan Beer found their rhythm in the fourth quarter, with Yang Tian-You and Wang Xin-Wei hitting consecutive three-pointers to regain the lead. However, in the final 23 seconds, the Warriors' guard Cao Xun-Xiang was fouled out, and Wang Hao-Ji made a free throw and a buzzer-beating three-pointer to give the Warriors a 58-51 lead. In the fourth quarter, the Warriors scored 29 points to complete the comeback victory against Taiwan Beer. Lin Ping-Sheng was the highest scorer in both games, and with the current discussions, he has the aura of being the team's leader. The Warriors' American head coach, Brian Adams, also mentioned that Lin Ping-Sheng has leadership qualities off the court and his dominance on the court can inspire his teammates. He is indeed an important player for the team and one of the leaders, but "we are a team, and we don't emphasize individuals. Everyone can lead the team."

Lin Ping-Sheng agreed, stating that every teammate is important, and "a good team doesn't have a single leader. If a team only has one leader, they cannot win a championship." He also mentioned the contributions of teammates such as Liu Yan-Ting's defense, Lin Le's pressure on the court, and Cao Xun-Xiang's momentum. He credited everyone for the comeback victory and hoped that they would continue to showcase their strengths and help the team.

Cao Xun-Xiang, who received a technical foul in today's game, played for Taiwan Beer last season. He mentioned that there was no animosity when facing his former teammates, but he had some opinions about the unfavorable calls from the referees. He acknowledged that he may have overreacted, leading to his fouling out. He also mentioned that the new coach joined the team about two weeks ago, and they haven't implemented many team strategies yet. Currently, they are focused on playing the game and continue to adjust to playing with new teammates.
