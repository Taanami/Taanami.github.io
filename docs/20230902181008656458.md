 NBA superstar Carmelo Anthony, also known as "Melo," announced his retirement from basketball in a heartfelt video on Twitter yesterday. After a career spanning 19 seasons, the soon-to-be 39-year-old expressed his gratitude and said, "For me, it's time to say goodbye." Anthony, who had played for the Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Los Angeles Lakers throughout his career, accumulated a total of 28,289 points, ranking him 9th on the NBA's all-time scoring list. Despite numerous personal achievements, including being selected to the NBA All-Star Game 10 times and being a member of the 75th Anniversary Team, Anthony never won an NBA championship. However, he had a successful international career, winning gold medals with the USA Men's Basketball team in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympics. Anthony was drafted as the third overall pick by the Denver Nuggets in the highly regarded 2003 NBA Draft, which also included future stars LeBron James, Chris Bosh, and Dwyane Wade. Throughout his career, injuries and aging took a toll on Anthony's performance, and his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game starting from the 2017-18 season. He played his final season with the Lakers in 2021-22, averaging a career-low 13.3 points per game. Despite these challenges, Anthony leaves behind a legacy as one of the NBA's greatest scorers. In his retirement, he plans to focus on his son, Kiyan, who is a highly regarded high school shooting guard with aspirations of playing for Syracuse University and eventually entering the NBA.
