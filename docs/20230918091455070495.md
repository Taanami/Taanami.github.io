 The Blurred Pros and Cons of the 2023 World Cup: The United States is Just a Strong Team, Not Invincible Powerhouse

Certainly, before the game against Lithuania, the US team had already secured a top-two finish in Group J of the second round, advancing to the quarterfinals, and even securing a spot in the Paris Olympics next year. However, by the standards of the US in various fields, it is still believed that as the world's number one basketball powerhouse, the US team is definitely favored to win.

But Lithuania refused to give up, or rather, they once again put the US in a situation of falling behind at the start of the game. In contrast to the previous five opponents of the US in this World Cup, Lithuania differs in that they only allowed the US to lead for 1 minute and 18 seconds within the first two minutes of the game. Even though the US team made a strong comeback in the second half, Lithuania did not allow the US to gain any advantage and ultimately won the game 110-104, ending the US team's undefeated streak in the World Cup and handing them their first loss of the tournament. Since the 2016 Rio Olympics, the US has been unable to maintain a perfect record in their last three international competitions.

They were already the most accurate outside shooting team in the World Cup so far, but today they not only made 6 out of 6 three-pointers in the first quarter, but also made 14 three-pointers throughout the game from 9 different players, including their starting center Jonas Valanciunas. All 11 players who played had attempts from beyond the arc. In the final 3 minutes and 52 seconds of the fourth quarter, Mindaugas Kuzminskas made a difficult three-pointer with Anthony Edwards defending closely, and with 1 minute and 43 seconds left, Tomas Dimsa successfully hit another three-pointer to extend the lead to 11 points. These two three-point shots dealt a heavy blow to the US. Strictly speaking, the US defense had almost no loopholes, but Lithuania seemed to have luck on their side and ultimately made it difficult for the US to catch up. Focusing only on three-point shots would be ignoring Lithuania's true strength. Center Jonas Valanciunas, due to his weakness in defending high pick-and-rolls in the NBA, has always been tested by NBA guards on various teams, including the New Orleans Pelicans or his previous teams. However, in FIBA rules that allow zone defense and allow centers to dominate inside the paint, Valanciunas, with his strong physique and versatile low-post offensive skills, combined with the chemistry and basketball IQ developed through long-term collaboration with the national team, is a dominant center in FIBA rules. Similar to the starting center for Montenegro in the previous game against the US, Nikola Vucevic, both players have shown their star power on the FIBA court. Lithuania's shortest player is 6 feet 4 inches, and all their guards are strong in terms of physicality. The post players, including Valanciunas, provide solid defense and strong rebounding. Every movement by Lithuania causes trouble for their opponents, even without any predetermined physical contact. The team has a consensus to play tough on the court, with shooters actively moving without the ball, and everyone is prepared to compete in offense, defense, and against their opponents. Even without the assistance of NBA star Domantas Sabonis, Lithuania is still a formidable force on the world stage.

Of course, the incredible three-point shooting in the first quarter helped them quickly build a large lead. However, the key to Lithuania's victory in this game was the aggressive style of play mentioned earlier. They established an early advantage in rebounds and off-ball scrambles. Apart from Jaren Jackson Jr. and the strong Edwards, the rest of the US starting lineup was at a disadvantage in their matchups against Lithuania. Even though the second unit had Tyrese Haliburton and Brandon Ingram, who had better physical attributes for their positions, Lithuania always found ways to attack Austin Reaves with team coverage. Lithuania outrebounded the US 43 to 27, and their second unit had a 17-2 advantage in scoring. Including Kuzminskas' offensive rebound and score at the end of the third quarter, Lithuania was able to maintain a safe distance from the US second unit until the fourth quarter. Fortunately, Lithuania had accumulated enough second unit offensive efforts in the first three quarters to maintain their lead. Otherwise, if Lithuania had only grabbed one offensive rebound and traded scores in the fourth quarter, the US's comeback could have been successful. As for the US, in the preliminary rounds, Josh Hart replaced Ingram in the starting lineup to address Ingram's slump. The starting lineup consisted of Hart, Mikal Bridges, and Jalen Brunson, who were all part of the Villanova championship connection. However, this starting lineup was clearly a "one big, four small" lineup with no ambiguity. This also indicates that Edwards was the only scoring threat, and Bridges and Hart, although they are considered "functional wing players" with some offensive explosiveness, are not like Valanciunas, who can dismantle opponents in the low post or superstars like Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, or at least Dwyane Wade, who can score in high-level games. From the US's starting lineup, or the team's overall selection, we can see that the US has many outstanding functional players. However, in this game against Lithuania, the flaws of this lineup were evident.
