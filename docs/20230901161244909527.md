 The World Cup comeback journey is too passionate. Yusuke Watanabe withdraws retirement statement and vows to serve the Japanese team until death.

In the World Cup qualifying match, Japan defeated Venezuela, ranked 17th, with a score of 86-77. This victory propelled Japan towards achieving the highest ranking in Asia and securing qualification for the Paris Olympics.

Yusuke Watanabe, who performed outstandingly in the first half, said, "I want to qualify for the Paris Olympics and continue to serve this team until death!" This unexpected "withdrawal of retirement declaration" caught everyone by surprise.

Previously, he had stated that if he couldn't qualify for the Paris Olympics in this tournament, he would "take off the national team jersey." But this victory brought him one step closer to the highest ranking in Asia and secured his Olympic ticket.

On September 2nd, they will face Cape Verde in their second match to compete for the only Olympic ticket in the Asian region. Watanabe praised the team, saying, "Today, the oldest player made a significant contribution to us. As usual, Marco performed excellently. Bjelica showed his true strength and continuously scored in the final stages of the game, leading us to a comeback victory."

He also said in the press conference, "Bjelica should attend the post-match press conference instead of me. He previously played in Australia and can speak English." "It was a great victory. Venezuela is a talented team with many experienced players. It was a tough game, but we never gave up. We fought for 40 minutes and achieved the final victory. I am proud of our team," Watanabe added. In this game, Yusuke Watanabe played for 38 minutes, shooting 8 out of 14, contributing 21 points, 8 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal.
