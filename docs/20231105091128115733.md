 During the first quarter of the NBA game between the Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Lakers, an unexpected incident occurred when Suns defender Jordan Goodwin accidentally poked LeBron James in the eye while guarding him.

The game was temporarily stopped as a foul was called on the play. However, LeBron quickly returned to the court and made two free throws before sinking a three-pointer with 26 seconds left in the first quarter. The Lakers currently hold a four-point lead over the Suns at halftime.

Kevin Durant, who was back in action for the Suns after missing the previous game, scored 21 points in the first half. The Lakers' scoring was led by LeBron with 19 points, followed by Anthony Davis with 13 points and Austin Reaves with 11 points. Despite being poked in the eye, LeBron showed no signs of being affected and continued to play at a high level. Both teams are putting up a strong fight in this preseason game.
