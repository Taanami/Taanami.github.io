  總教練Pozzecco最後說：「這就是世界盃的美妙之處，你永遠不知道會發生什麼事情。我們現在只能專注於最後一場比賽，希望能結束世界盃之旅時以勝利作結。」

Italy's head coach, Gianmarco Pozzecco, spoke about the team's performance and the possibility of facing the United States in the quarter-finals during the FIBA World Cup. After losing two consecutive games, Italy could only compete for 7th-8th place in the tournament.

Pozzecco first mentioned the achievement of reaching the quarter-finals, saying that if someone had told him five years ago that Italy would make it this far, he would have thought it was a joke. The team proved themselves in the past 3-4 years and showed that it was possible.

When asked about facing the United States in the quarter-finals, Pozzecco said, "All the fans in Italy support us and believe that we can defeat the United States. But this is just my personal opinion. I believe that if we didn't face the United States, we would have been one of the teams to advance to the semi-finals. You might think this is an exaggeration, but don't worry, you are not the first one to think about it and you won't be the last."

Italy secured their spot in the quarter-finals by defeating Serbia in the round of 16, but they did not expect the Dominican Republic to lose two consecutive games, allowing Italy to advance to the final eight and face the United States after losing to them in the second round.

Pozzecco concluded by saying, "That's the beauty of the World Cup, you never know what will happen. We can only focus on our last game and hope to end our journey with a victory."
