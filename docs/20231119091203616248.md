 According to Shams, sources revealed that the Houston Rockets have been in contact with several teams to send away Kevin Porter Jr. following an incident of domestic violence. It is expected that Porter will not participate in training camp. The 2023-24 season will be the first year of Porter's 4-year, $82.5 million contract, with the first year being fully guaranteed.

The Rockets are looking to acquire a player who can immediately contribute to the team. In yesterday's program, renowned ESPN reporter Woj stated, "The league has initiated an investigation and will deal with it in the near future...there is no doubt that Porter's future with the Rockets and in the NBA is in jeopardy."

Last year, Miles Bridges was arrested for a domestic violence incident and ultimately missed the entire season (although he will return to the team for training camp this season). According to reports from ABC, Porter pleaded not guilty to the charges of domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend, a former WNBA player, and was released on a $75,000 bond. The judge also issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting Porter from contacting his ex-girlfriend. Previous reports stated that Porter allegedly assaulted his ex-girlfriend at a hotel in New York, resulting in a fractured vertebra in her neck and a cut above her right eye.
