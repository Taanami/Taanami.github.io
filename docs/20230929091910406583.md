  112UBA New Challenges After Creating History - Chen Yuanwen of Nan Ying University

During his high school and university years, Chen Yuanwen can be considered a "creator of school team history." While studying at Shanhua High School, he helped the team win their first high school level B championship in his second year. Then, after transferring to Nan Ying University, he helped this team, which consisted entirely of players from high school level B teams, rise to prominence. In the 111th academic year, they made it to the top four of the A2 level, earning the qualification to move up to the A1 level.

Continuing to read further, Chen Yuanwen competed on the court of the Chang Yao Cup during his high school years. He even made it to the star training team of that cup. Five and a half years later, Chen Yuanwen and Nan Ying University were invited to participate in this year's Chang Yao Cup, which moved from Banqiao to Xinzhuang. However, what remains unchanged is that Chen Yuanwen, who had just helped the team win the league championship, once again experienced the intensity of playing at the college level as a "creator of history."

Chen Yuanwen scored the second-highest points for the team and grabbed six rebounds. Despite not being tall or explosively athletic, Chen Yuanwen has relied on his unique intuition around the basket since high school. In the game against Chengchi University, he still played to his strengths and found opportunities to score by exploiting gaps in the defense of foreign players. Please continue reading.

Speaking about his feelings of returning to the Chang Yao Cup five years later, Chen Yuanwen smiled and said, "After all, it's a different level. Now we are playing as a member of the public first level. The mentality is different, and I feel my own growth!" But he immediately analyzed with seriousness, "I think the biggest difference is physique, followed by experience. After all, we all came from the B group, while our opponents have played in international games and professional teams. We only started exchanging with A1 level teams this summer. But overall, I think the content of the game is good. We haven't reached our best level of cooperation yet, so we will continue to work hard and focus on every detail that we can improve."

Continuing to read, Chen Yuanwen revealed that entering the A1 level was something that he never imagined before but has now become a reality. He admitted that most members of Nan Ying University do not prioritize basketball as the center of their lives, and they do not have many advantages in terms of talent. Last year, the team even had to train extra after the draw results for the second level national competition were announced, which can be described as a last-minute effort. However, after winning the first game in the national tournament and advancing to the top eight by defeating Kun Shan University, Nan Ying University had already achieved a milestone in team history. Throughout the process, Chen Yuanwen only focused on giving his all and did not think too much about the outcome. But as the final whistle sounded in the game against National Wake Up University, he couldn't help but be filled with excitement, leaving tears of a man behind.

"I originally thought it was already good enough to make it to the top sixteen, but then we made it to the top eight, and then the top four. I truly never imagined that we, who came from the B level, could personally accomplish this!" Chen Yuanwen reminisced. He admitted that he felt "closer to professionalism than ever before" as he approached what he thought would be the end of his basketball career. If he could attract the attention of professional teams through his performance in the A1 level, continuing to run on the court would also be an option for the future. However, at the moment, he will focus on preparing for the UBA season of the new academic year and strive wholeheartedly towards "creating history" once again, aiming to secure the team's place in the league. "This is already the stage I most desired. There are no regrets in my basketball career! I will give my all in every game and let our opponents know that we also have the strength to challenge here!"
