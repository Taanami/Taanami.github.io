 Taking Away the Changes Under the Starlight: The Triangle Relationship Between Wembanyama and Sochan in the Spurs

The arrival of Victor Wembanyama is not only a talent upgrade for the Spurs, but also a guiding light for them. If this 2023 draft pick lives up to expectations, Gregg Popovich and Brian Wright will build the team around him with players that suit his style.

The first step in this process is finding the right starting lineup for him. It's no secret that Wembanyama is likely to play power forward, which means someone from last year's roster, apart from Zach Collins, will have to make way. The obvious answer is the player who occupied that position last season, Jeremy Sochan, but his uniqueness complicates things in a positive way.

Is Sochan really a power forward? Technically, yes, but some players break the outdated position definitions, and he is one of them. Part of it is due to his performance, and part of it is how the Spurs utilize him. As the team is in a rebuilding phase and not overly concerned about winning, they have given this rookie the freedom to find his own direction in the league and experiment with his role. Sochan has defended many forwards and other players of similar build, but he has also spent a significant amount of time defending guards, and not just because of the team's defensive system.

The same situation applies to offense. Sochan sometimes takes the initiative, while other times he operates closer to the basket. Coach Popovich clearly wants to see if Sochan is versatile and can be "more than just" a traditional power forward.

To his credit, Sochan has performed well in various aspects, especially considering his lack of experience.

The question is whether he can be a "Swiss Army Knife" player who cannot be categorized throughout his career, or if he needs to stop doing what he can do and focus on excelling at what he's good at. This is not an urgent question in general, but with Wembanyama's arrival and his expected position as the starting power forward, it becomes crucial whether Sochan can handle the small forward role or become a player suitable for any position.

Before discussing specific skills, being versatile is an advantage, and having multiple skills also makes him a better fit as the Spurs' second option in the future. Can Sochan complement the future team center, Wembanyama, when they share the court? He should be able to handle defense, as mentioned earlier, being able to defend wings and guards, and he can also shoulder the toughest tasks as a forward, allowing Wembanyama to roam and provide help defense.

As for his rebounding, even though his numbers may be affected by the presence of two tall players, it can still benefit him as it allows him to initiate fast breaks. However, his fit with the team remains a big question mark, as Sochan lacks reliable shooting ability, which may complicate things in half-court situations. Sochan takes free throws in a completely non-traditional way - one-handed - which has improved his free throw percentage from 59% in college to 70%, but his three-point shooting percentage is only 24%, lower than his 29% in college.

Perhaps Sochan can become a sharpshooter despite his struggles, but overall, he is not a natural shooter, which could be a concern as Wembanyama is currently inconsistent in shooting and needs some space when attempting his own shots.

Of course, it is unfair to overly focus on what Sochan cannot do. Even as a rookie, he has shown that he can punish smaller players in the backcourt and penetrate through taller opponents. Whether Sochan faces a forward or a guard, he can create advantages elsewhere or exploit defensive mismatches.

Since Sochan already has the mindset of a role player and glue guy, continuing to play a supporting role should not be difficult for him. Having Sochan alongside Wembanyama may provide some advantages. However, can these advantages outweigh the benefits of having Keldon Johnson as the traditional small forward? Johnson's scoring ability, emerging playmaking skills, and inconsistent but continuously improving three-point shooting make him a better fit for the young Wembanyama. On the contrary, what is best for the team may not be as important, and although Sochan's career started as a power forward, he could also transition to the perimeter like Johnson over time, but there is a risk that this may not come true.

The arrival of Wembanyama is undoubtedly a good thing for the Spurs, but a secondary issue arises - how to utilize a rookie power forward who has shown excellent performance and significant two-way potential.

Sochan could potentially play at both forward positions next season (or even as a guard if Coach Popovich wants to experiment), so there is no need to make any extreme decisions now. However, Sochan must quickly prove that he can be effective alongside Wembanyama or excel in the role of the sixth man.
