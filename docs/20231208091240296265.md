  Jovic played in the World Cup while still in high school, I received my diploma two days after returning home.

Nikola Jovic's talent was on full display at this year's World Cup. He played as the starting power forward for his national team and had an impressive performance with an average of 10.1 points and 2.6 assists, while maintaining a high shooting percentage (56.6%, 3-pointers 42.3%). He also helped his team reach the World Cup finals. On his way back to the US to prepare for the new season, Jovic was interviewed by the local media outlet Miami Herald, where he talked about his eventful summer â€“ playing in the NBA finals with the Heat in June, followed by participating in the summer league and the World Cup.

First, Jovic talked about his physical condition. He mentioned that he had a back injury during the summer league, but it wasn't serious enough to stop him from playing. He just needed some rest. Fortunately, he didn't miss any practices or games with the national team. As for his body condition, Jovic revealed that he lost weight due to playing a lot of games this summer, but he has already gained it back and is currently at 234 pounds. When asked if he has grown taller to 7 feet, Jovic replied that even with shoes on, he probably wouldn't reach that height. 

Moving on to his preparations for the new season, Jovic said that the biggest improvement he made this summer was in his confidence. Every veteran player on the national team encouraged him to have confidence and take shots. He also put a lot of effort into his shooting, building his confidence to perform well on a bigger stage, like the World Cup.

Lastly, the reporter asked about his high school education. Last season, there were questions about whether Jovic was still in high school or not, and he mentioned that he had to attend online classes while practicing. Today, he revealed to the reporter that he finally received his diploma two days after the World Cup ended. He even went to his school personally to pick it up the day after celebrating on the streets of Serbia.
