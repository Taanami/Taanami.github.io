  Pre-season PLG S4 Hsinchu City Lions are ready for a defensive revolution in European style

Despite being embroiled in player contract disputes, the Hsinchu City Lions have not stopped reinforcing their team. The newly appointed GM, Zhang Shuren, recently announced the arrival of Serbian coach Milan Mitrovic, hoping to bring his past experiences and lead a transformation both internally and externally for the team.

What kind of help or changes can we expect from the current roster of the City Lions? Let's explore further. Please continue reading.

Apart from the ups and downs in player contracts, the City Lions have undergone some changes. Firstly, their title sponsor partnership has ended, and the team will return to being called the "Hsinchu City Lions" as they start afresh. The position of GM, which had been vacant for a long time, has now been taken over by Zhang Shuren, the former GM of the New Taipei CTBC Bank, and the Secretary-General of the T1 League. He hopes to bring about changes from within and elevate the team towards their first championship in history. Zhang Shuren holds a Master's degree in Business Administration from the Johns Hopkins University in the United States. He has held various positions in the media and team management, showing his involvement in both baseball and basketball. He has also served as a PR and spokesperson for international competitions, demonstrating his high level of familiarity with the industry. As the GM who built the inaugural team for the CTBC Bank, he successfully laid the foundation for a championship-winning team and created an award-winning home court. Later, he was recruited into the league headquarters, where his excellent skills and thinking were evident in theme design and organizing All-Star games. It is fair to say that he is one of the top management figures in the industry. [Interview] Zhang Shuren, the newly appointed General Manager of the Hsinchu City Lions: "Taking Hsinchu's local support and going out to communicate with the world." The above is an excerpt from a previous interview with Zhang Shuren, the author of the article, and if you are interested in understanding his profound thoughts and expectations for the future of the City Lions, I recommend taking the time to read it.

Throughout the years of transitioning between teams and positions, it is clear that Zhang Shuren has always talked about completing phase-based missions. This indicates the demands and execution power he sets for himself in different positions. Facing the changing trend of basketball development in Asia, it is the main reason that led him to take on the role of GM once again. He has a strong desire to promote regional basketball development and exchange between professional teams from different countries, making the team an international professional basketball club. Recent waves of news have shown that their plans are already in motion and are making more people see their efforts.

In July of this year, the Hsinchu City Lions formed a sister team partnership with the Japanese B.LEAGUE team Aomori Wat's, and the two teams plan to visit each other's home court for friendly games during the new season. They have also sent their long-trained youth team to visit the home court of the Ryukyu Golden Kings in Okinawa for venue tours and friendly matches, allowing the team to learn and grow both on and off the court.

Recently, they went to Xiamen to participate in the "Xiamen Professional Basketball Invitational" and at the end of the month, they will travel to Singapore to participate in the FIBA Intercontinental Cup exhibition games. The team is united from top to bottom, and with Zhang Shuren taking over, the progress has become faster and more solid. Regarding the team roster, Zhang Shuren believes that "in the past two years, I have come to realize the importance of team basketball. This offseason, our focus is on how to develop local players and combine them with foreign players' offensive and defensive characteristics."

With the foreign players' situations yet to be finalized, there is still a lot of room for exploration and maneuvering. Fans can look forward to finding players suitable for the team's development.

When it comes to local operations, Zhang Shuren mentioned, "In the past three years, the City Lions and the Purple Lions have fully embodied the concept that 'this city needs a team.' I hope that in the next season, besides being the team with the highest cohesion in Taiwan, we can bring glory back to this city." It seems they are ready for a complete transformation.

Assistant coach with European style joins the coaching staff, can the Lions spark a team revolution? One of Zhang Shuren's first moves after taking office was to recruit Serbian coach Milan Mitrovic into the coaching staff, hoping to establish the desired team style as the first step. During the announcement, it was mentioned, "European players have a great understanding of basketball and the ability to read the game situation. By recruiting a Serbian assistant coach, we hope to incorporate elements of European basketball style and help the City Lions embody the concept of team basketball." This gives a sense of whether everything will follow a successful model to build a new team.

At 42 years old, Mitrovic has extensive coaching experience, particularly in player development. He has previously served as an assistant coach in various European professional basketball leagues, including Serbia, Romania, and Poland. From 2014 to 2021, he was an assistant coach for the CSM Oradea team in the Romanian Basketball League, which is a regular participant in the playoffs. He has helped the team win championships three times in this role and has even made appearances in the national team. After a brief stint in the Polish league two years ago, he returned to Romania last year as the head coach of FC Arges Pitesti. This is his first time coaching in Asia. When interviewed, Mitrovic stated, "I will pay special attention to defensive details in the future. I believe that the finesse of defense will be the key to future victories. In the near future, I will analyze each player's offensive and defensive strengths through video analysis. I will assist Head Coach Guanlun during team training and help players improve their individual skills." This points out the Lions' major flaw from last year, with an average of 99.6 points conceded per game, ranking last in the league with a significant gap. Strengthening defense through discipline and systematic team cohesion will be the key to the team's transformation.
