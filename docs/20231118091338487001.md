 14 Lai Zheng-wei, who consistently achieves close to double-double stats, was named the top five players in the central region. In the national finals, he had an astonishing performance of 20 points and 10 rebounds against the talented team from Fu Ming International School. He also averaged 10.2 rebounds per game, becoming the rebound king of this year's college alumni category. Please continue reading.

Captain Lin Jun-jie, who graduated from Changhua Normal University Affiliated Senior High School, believes that the difference between high school and college is that the desire to win is not as strong as it was in high school. The most important thing is to be able to play basketball with everyone. He also said, "I would like to say to the future CHH players in the inter-school category that the original intention of the TGF World Fire Cup is to bring everyone together to play basketball before graduating. I hope that the spirit of friendship will not be affected by the outcome of the game. I also hope that CHH will continue to maintain the tradition of having all members from Changhua."

Another player, Lin You-hao, who used to be a "war god" from Chongshi High School, led his team to the southern regional playoffs, and is one of the younger players in this year's CHH team. He continues to show his skills on the court, providing outside shooting power in crucial moments, and is one of the players targeted by other teams' defense. As a younger player, he says that the TGF World Fire Cup was cancelled during his senior year due to the pandemic, and this is his first time participating in CHH. He was invited by his senior teammates to join the team, and he said with a smile, "I am very happy to be able to play with different generations of senior players. I used to just watch them dominate in various competitions, and now I have this strange feeling of playing with them on the same team."

In addition, he and Lin Jun-jie both expressed that they are grateful to be able to reunite with their former teammates through the TGF World Fire Cup and continue the tradition of CHH not only in high school but also in college. They also thank the TGF World Fire Cup for benefiting amateur players like themselves and giving them a stage to showcase their skills. They also thank all the staff for providing us with such a wonderful stage and environment. (Photo provided by players) Every reunion has its meaning.

Whether it is from the words or the players' performance on and off the court, we can see their sense of belonging and identification with the name and team of CHH. The TGF World Fire Cup is able to maintain its goal and philosophy of sustainability by using this tournament to connect players from different years. Although the younger players in the inter-school category were unable to stand on the national finals stage with their senior teammates, we believe that whether playing in the alumni category or the inter-school category, CHH players will continue this tradition and bring glory to Changhua.
