#  還記得在前一場面對暴龍隊時，總教練Griffin在關鍵時刻將Lillard給放上場，因為現在真的是比起Middleton，Lillard對於對手的防守不是那麼有威脅，因此可以讓Middleton有更多的空間去做自己最擅長的中距離跳投，進而影響到對手的防守幫助，而在這場比賽最後一擊，Giannis也被防守得很痛苦，最後主將也是選擇傳球給外圍該死的Middleton，結果呢?他依舊是一樣的穩定，關鍵時刻的中距離跳投出手之後，對手就是沒有辦法將他給幹掉。

 總結一下，今天是一場比較少見的，公鹿隊進攻端的策略在關鍵時刻是非常成功的，也因此讓球隊在關鍵時刻可以贏得比賽。但是防守端的問題依舊是一大隱憂，如果不能夠在防守端提升，球隊在季後賽的表現恐怕仍會受到限制。因此，總教練Griffin需要持續嘗試不同的戰術與陣容，以期能夠讓球隊在季後賽有更多可能性。最後，也希望公鹿隊能夠保持這樣的良好表現，繼續向前邁進。

After-game Analysis: Bucks' Three-point Shooting Shines in Critical Moments

The Bucks have been continuously trying to find their rhythm and maximize their potential on the offensive end. From preseason to the current season, each game has shown a different style from the Bucks, with head coach Griffin trying out different strategies and tactics for the team. In this game, it was evident that Beasley had a lot of ball control compared to the previous game against the Raptors, where he was almost the first option on offense, often playing hand-in-hand with Giannis. However, in this game against the Knicks, Beasley was almost invisible and spent most of his time squatting in the corner. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the Knicks were well aware of Lillard's recent instability and Middleton's limited playing time, limiting the Bucks' options on offense. Therefore, the Bucks could only focus their firepower on Beasley, who has been in great form recently, helping the Big Three to have more opportunities to mesh together. Please continue reading.

In the first quarter, Giannis used his terrifying roll-in threat to help open up space for his other two teammates. At the same time, the other two executed a simple hand-off at the 45-degree angle, challenging the Knicks' defensive communication.

Aside from the improved chemistry of the Big Three, the team's fast break transition was also in full force without any hesitation. Whenever there was an opportunity, Giannis would quickly push the ball and charge towards the Knicks' paint, catching them off guard.

Please continue reading. This is one of the tactics that the Bucks like to execute. However, instead of having Giannis lead the charge, they switched to Lillard, who has better organization and passing skills. Aside from his elite finishing ability and improved passing skills, Lillard would not recklessly charge into defenders and cause offensive fouls (yes, we're talking about you, Giannis). Against the smaller Knicks lineup, when two stars set a screen, dragging the tall Portis out to the perimeter to defend him, Hartenstein, who was also guarding him, would have to follow, leaving the smaller guards as the last line of defense. This is because Immanuel Quickley, who is weaker on defense and has less help awareness, is the last line of defense. This allows Connaughton to easily run into the open space and score an easy two-pointer.

The goal of this tactic is to use Lillard's outside threat to create open space for his teammates. Even when the Bucks players are not in their ideal positions, when facing Lillard's pick-and-roll offense, the Knicks players' instinct is to double-team him and prevent him from taking an outside shot. However, Portis easily slips past the defense and scores an easy two-pointer.

Please continue reading. The most straightforward and violent tactic, this is what the Bucks want to see. With the double-star pick-and-roll threat, the Bucks are already terrifying. If there is a moment of hesitation, Giannis will either score an easy two-pointer by charging into the paint or pass it to Lillard for an open three-pointer. However, the real key to elevating the team's offensive threat is the sharpshooters lurking in the weak-side corner. The defense's efficiency is at the bottom, so what? Don't think you can easily score in the paint. After the change in leadership, the team's biggest concern, defense, is still a major issue. From the start of the season until now, the team's defensive efficiency is close to the top of the league (if counting from the bottom).

It's expected that the defensive efficiency would drop, but with two DPOY-level players on the team, this performance is unacceptable. In this game against the Knicks, Lopez's seven blocks completely overwhelmed the Knicks players. The main reason I think is that the team had fewer players with physical disadvantages in the backcourt and frontcourt, and the Knicks' starting center Mitchell Robinson does not pose a threat from the perimeter. Therefore, Lopez was able to spend more time guarding the paint, and head coach Griffin decisively put Beasley, who was not playing well, on the bench and substituted in Crowder, who is more aggressive in defensive communication and gives opponents a hard time. At the same time, in the critical moments, Griffin finally loosened the playing time restrictions on Middleton, allowing the team to use a lineup with better physical advantages to compete with the Knicks.

Do you remember in the last game against the Raptors, Griffin put Lillard on the court in the critical moments because compared to Middleton, Lillard is not as much of a threat to the opponent's defense. Therefore, Middleton had more space to make his signature mid-range jump shots, which also affected the opponent's defensive help. In the final play of this game, Giannis was also struggling against the defense, and the final option was to pass the ball to Middleton in the corner, who once again showed his consistency and made a mid-range jump shot that the opponent could not stop.

In conclusion, this was a rare game where the Bucks' offensive strategy was successful in the critical moments, leading the team to victory. However, the defensive issues are still a major concern, and if they cannot improve on that end, the team's performance in the playoffs may still be limited. Therefore, head coach Griffin needs to continue trying out different tactics and lineups to give the team more possibilities in the playoffs. Lastly, I hope the Bucks can maintain this level of performance and continue to move forward.
