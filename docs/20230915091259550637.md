  Italy regains its touch in the second half, defeats Puerto Rico 73-57 to advance to the quarterfinals

In the final match of the World Cup Round of 16, Puerto Rico faced Italy. Both teams had previously won their matches, setting up a winner-takes-all situation. Italy had a slight lead over Puerto Rico in the first half, although they encountered some difficulties in the third quarter. However, they managed to regain their form towards the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth, widening the point difference and ultimately winning the game to advance to the quarterfinals. 

Italy initially fell behind by four points but quickly turned things around with a 15-0 run. They maintained the lead for most of the first half, with Stefano Tonut scoring 13 points. Although Puerto Rico had a better shooting percentage than Italy, their offensive initiator, Tremont Waters, made too many mistakes (7 turnovers). Puerto Rico managed to narrow the gap in the second half of the second quarter, but Italy still led 39-36 at halftime.

In the second half, both teams became more familiar with each other's offensive strategies, resulting in more aggressive defense. Italy struggled on the offensive end, only scoring three points in the first five minutes and falling behind Puerto Rico. Fortunately, Italy stabilized towards the end of the third quarter and entered the fourth quarter with a four-point lead.

Italy carried their momentum from the end of the third quarter into the fourth. During this period, Luigi Datome, Giampaolo Ricci, and Simone Fontecchio all made three-pointers, extending the lead to over ten points.

Italy didn't let victory slip away and ultimately defeated Puerto Rico 73-57, advancing to the final eight and securing a spot in the Paris Olympics. The outcome of the upcoming quarterfinals will determine Italy's further progress in the tournament.

Rebounding was the key factor in Italy's victory, as they outrebounded their opponents by 19. Four players scored in double digits for Italy, with Giampaolo Ricci and Stefano Tonut both scoring 15 points, Simone Fontecchio contributing 12 points and 12 rebounds, and Luigi Datome adding 11 points. Waters' underperformance for Puerto Rico, with only 13 points and 9 assists, was one of the reasons for their defeat. The highest-scoring player for Puerto Rico, Jordan Howard, had just 11 points.
