 Interview with the cutest sports anchor, Li Yihan: A jersey represents not only a team but also a spirit.

Li Yihan, who currently works as a sports anchor at Elta TV, recalls her first time as an event host at an outdoor basketball game in Taoyuan. The game used the innovative "glowing ball" developed by ANGO, which amazed her and left a deep impression of the brand. During her time at V Sports Channel, she noticed that teams like Taipower and Tatung were wearing ANGO jerseys during the Taiwan Enterprise Football League broadcasts. This sparked her interest in ANGO and made her realize that ANGO is not just a sports equipment manufacturer but also develops high-quality jerseys for both football and basketball, providing athletes with diverse choices.

Please continue reading below as we explore the new possibilities that arise when a new generation sports anchor encounters a new generation sports brand and jerseys. What does the perfect jersey look like in the eyes of a sports anchor? Despite being a new sports brand, ANGO jerseys have a refreshing design and offer the comfort and moisture-wicking properties required by athletes. Li Yihan shares her vision of the perfect jersey: "First, the external design must be visually appealing with good color coordination. Second, it should be comfortable and able to absorb sweat, especially during intense games where quick-drying functionality is preferred to ensure the jersey dries quickly after washing for the next game."

During the interview, Li Yihan was wearing an ANGO jersey and praised it, saying, "I think ANGO jerseys are great because they not only look good and feel comfortable but also pay attention to details that concern women, such as transparency, coverage, and the fit of sleeveless designs."

It is apparent that creating a good jersey is not an easy task. It requires maintaining high standards of quality, comfort, and style, as well as considering the needs of the users through thoughtful design. This is something that the brand needs to invest in.

Please continue reading below as we delve into ANGO's professional jerseys that have made strides from the football industry to the basketball realm, leading in high-end functionality and performance. Li Yihan, a sports anchor who has long been focused on the sports industry, has had a close relationship with sports since her high school days when she developed a love for basketball. She even played for her university's basketball team and started her career as a sports reporter. Her personal experiences have given her a unique perspective on the influence of sports brands.

"I know that ANGO has collaborated with JHBL (Junior High Basketball League) this year, sponsoring customized jerseys, warm-up suits, and socks for the players. I think this is a great thing. It not only means recognition for JHBL but also represents more people getting to know Taiwanese sports brands, creating a mutual support and benefit."

Having experienced playing basketball during her student years, Li Yihan understands the importance of sponsorship and encouragement for student teams. Therefore, she highly appreciates ANGO's efforts in supporting grassroots sports, such as providing balls and jerseys. While ANGO initially focused on the football market, they have recently expanded into basketball, offering high-quality jerseys to enable athletes to perform at their best.

Despite expanding their supply chain, ANGO maintains an environmentally-friendly manufacturing process. This commitment to environmental protection has impressed Li Yihan.

Just like a perfect jersey should consider not only the athletes but also the entire industry ecosystem and manufacturing environment, maintaining an environmentally-friendly spirit is not only beneficial for the sports industry but also for the planet.

A jersey represents not only a team but also a spirit. Li Yihan, who has covered countless sports events, chose this career not only because of her admiration and curiosity for television work but also because of her passion and love for sports. Her dedication and professionalism have earned her the title of "cutest anchor," reflecting her genuine enthusiasm for her work. She believes that work, just like sports, requires continuous improvement in expertise and skills. Despite being a public figure and often being scrutinized and criticized by online trolls, she remains willing to change her mindset and continue to push herself. "My next goal is to improve my ability to broadcast games, especially my favorite basketball events. I also hope to one day report on Olympic games from the venue." Li Yihan's clear goals and determined attitude shine through as she talks, as if she is about to take a shot and confidently hit the bullseye. In this damp and cold December, let ANGO's hat T warm your heart.
