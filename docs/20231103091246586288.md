 112HBL's Thirteen New Recruits: The Challenging Journey of Keelung Commercial and Industrial High School in the 112th School Year

As one of the top traditional powerhouses in the northern region of HBL Division A, Keelung Commercial and Industrial High School has been unable to break through the top eight since the 104th school year. With the rapid changes in the HBL landscape, although Keelung Commercial has maintained competitiveness, it has always struggled to make a breakthrough.

In the 111th school year, Keelung Commercial welcomed coach Zhang Lijie, who had just led Jinhe High School to create a legend as the dark horse in the top eight, and most of the senior students on the team were both physically and individually talented, with the experience of competing in the league. They ushered in a "harvest year", and showed impressive team strength in several cup competitions last summer. Photo: Coach Zhang Lijie of Keelung Commercial. In the subsequent qualifying rounds, they even narrowly defeated Dongshan High School in a crucial game, dispelling the shadow of failing to make it to the preliminaries in the 110th school year. However, in the later 16th round, they were grouped with Songshan High School, Nengren Commercial and Industrial High School, and Zhiping High School, all of which had the strength to make it to the top eight, making it the "group of death" in last year's preliminaries. After a tough loss to Nengren Commercial and Industrial High School and Songshan High School, in the final game against Zhiping High School, they were reversed by their opponents after leading by a large margin, marking the end of their season in the preliminaries. After the end of the last school year, Keelung Commercial bid farewell to ten of the twelve players on the starting lineup, who were all seniors, and welcomed major changes in their lineup. In the 112th school year, Keelung Commercial is going through a difficult new beginning.

Please continue reading. In the qualifying round, as many as thirteen players will be stepping onto the HBL stage for the first time. Compared to other strong teams, Keelung Commercial showed some immaturity in the various cup competitions last summer, and when facing teams like Songshan High School, who put a lot of pressure on them physically, they would appear flustered. Coach Zhang Lijie also admitted that the team's adjustments towards the end of the summer were just passing. Zhang Lijie pointed out that the tall players on the team are still only sophomores, so they need to improve their awareness of positioning and rebounding, as well as the team's overall understanding of attacking and defending, and their ability to adapt to changing defenses. However, he also affirmed the players' ability to absorb and adjust during the game. "They won't give up even when faced with adversity, and they are slowly absorbing and executing what we need during timeouts. Their execution has been improving, and while I can't say they have caught up with all the other teams, I believe they will be in good shape before the start of the qualifying round." "When we recruit players, we find that many people think Keelung is too far away, but there are still many kids who are willing to come and have potential," Zhang Lijie said. "I have confidence in this group of freshmen and sophomores. They have all the necessary qualities and are moldable, but they lack experience. So this year, I hope they can gain experience first and quickly have the ability to compete with other teams." As a player, Zhang Lijie played under coaches such as Liao Wenbin, Chen Ziwei, and Wang Zhiqun. He was known for his aggressive and fierce defense. After becoming a coach, he also took the defensive system he learned from several famous coaches as the core of the team. However, after joining Keelung Commercial, known for its explosive offense, he began to gradually adjust his training methods in order to find a perfect balance between offense and defense.

"Defense is my strong suit, and it has a significant proportion in our training. But Keelung Commercial has always been a team that loves to run and gun, with a traditional style. Coming here, I also have to blend into this culture, so in the past, defense may have taken up 80% of our training, but now it will be adjusted to 60%."

Looking at the team structure of Keelung Commercial in the 112th school year, the starting lineup includes left-handed guard Chen Pinlun, as well as the Chen brothers, Chen Weijie and Chen Weihan, who have experience playing in the National Junior High School Division II tournament. Among the seven sophomores, four are over 184cm tall. Among them, Yang Yihuan, a 190cm forward from Tzu Chi Junior High School, although a bit slender, has excellent mobility and may become the X-factor in helping the team break through. Based on the overall condition of Keelung Commercial this year, it can be expected that they will face significant challenges due to their lack of experience. However, Zhang Lijie has previously helped Tai-Shan High School win the championship and led Jinhe High School to create a dark horse legend. Whether he can continue to lead the team to progress and overcome obstacles in the games will be a key focus of the 112th HBL qualifying round. Follow Sports Vision for more in-depth sports coverage.
