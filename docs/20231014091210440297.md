  Taking Away the Changes Under the Stars: The Triangular Relationship Between Wembanyama and Sochan in the Spurs

The arrival of Victor Wembanyama is not only a talent upgrade for the Spurs, but also a direction guide for them. If this 2023 draft pick lives up to everyone's expectations, Gregg Popovich and Brian Wright will build the team around him with players that suit his style.

The first step in this process is to find a suitable starting lineup for him. It's no secret that Wembanyama is likely to play power forward, which means someone from last season's roster, other than Zach Collins, will have to be pushed out. The obvious answer is the player who played that position last season, Jeremy Sochan, but his uniqueness adds complexity to the situation.

Please continue reading Is Sochan really a power forward? Technically, he is, but some players break the outdated position definitions, and he is one of them. Part of it is due to his performance, and part of it is how the Spurs use him. As the team is in a rebuilding phase and not focused on winning, they have given this rookie enough freedom to find his own direction in the league and experiment with his role.

Sochan has defended against many power forwards and other players with similar builds, but he has also spent just as much time defending guards, not just because of the team's defensive system.

The same goes for offense. Sochan sometimes takes initiative, and sometimes he stays close to the basket. It's clear that Popovich wants to see if Sochan is versatile and can be "more than just" a traditional power forward.

It's worth noting that Sochan has performed well in many aspects, especially considering his lack of experience.

The question is, can he be a "Swiss Army knife" player who can't be categorized throughout his career, or does he need to stop doing what he can do and focus on what he's good at to reach his potential? Please continue reading In general, this is not an urgent question, but with Wembanyama's arrival and his expected position as the starting power forward in the near future, it becomes crucial whether Sochan can play small forward or become a player who can fit any position.

When it comes to specialized skills, being versatile is an advantage, and having many skills also means being better suited to be the second option on the Spurs in the future.

Will Sochan be able to complement the future team center by playing alongside Wembanyama? He should be able to defend, as mentioned earlier, he can defend wings and guards, and he can also shoulder the toughest tasks at the power forward position, allowing Wembanyama to roam and provide help defense. As for his rebounding, even if his stats are affected by playing next to two tall players, it will still help him as it allows him to start fast breaks.

However, his fit with the team still remains a big question mark - after all, Sochan lacks a reliable shooting ability, and this could make things complicated in half-court situations. Sochan does things in a completely non-traditional way - shooting free throws with one hand, improving his free throw shooting from 59% in college to 70%, and his three-point shooting percentage is only 24%, lower than his 29% in college.

Even as a rookie, he has shown that he can punish smaller players in the backcourt and penetrate through taller players.

No matter which forward or guard Wembanyama is facing, Sochan can create advantages elsewhere or defend mismatches.

Since Sochan already has the mindset of a role player and glue guy, it shouldn't be difficult for him to continue playing a supporting role, and having Sochan play alongside Wembanyama may bring some advantages. But can these advantages outweigh the benefits of having Keldon Johnson play small forward in a traditional lineup? Johnson's scoring ability, emerging ball-handling skills, and inconsistent but continuously improving three-point shooting all make him a better fit for a young Wembanyama. An opposing argument is that what's best for the team doesn't matter, and even though Sochan's career started as a power forward, he could also move to the perimeter as time goes on, but there is also a risk that this may not happen. It's undeniable that Wembanyama's arrival is a good thing for the Spurs, but a secondary issue arises - how to use a rookie who showed great potential and is a vital two-way player at the power forward position. Sochan could play at both forward positions next season (or even as a guard if Popovich wants to experiment), so there's no need to make any extreme decisions right now, but Sochan must prove as soon as possible that he can play a useful role next to Wembanyama or take on the role of the sixth man.

In this way, the Spurs can fully utilize the potential of both players and minimize potential conflicts, which is an important consideration for a young team. However, don't forget about Sochan's potential, he may become a key player for the Spurs in the years to come.
