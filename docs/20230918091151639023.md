 Video World Cup Finals: Germany Defeats USA to Advance to Championship Game

In the second game of the FIBA World Cup semifinals, Germany faced off against the USA. The winner would go on to compete against Serbia for the championship. Germany had an impressive offensive performance, scoring 113 points and ultimately holding off a comeback attempt by the USA to secure a victory and advance to the World Cup championship game. This marks the second consecutive World Cup where the USA has failed to clinch the title. 

From the start, Germany took control of the game, creating space on offense and keeping the ball moving, leading the USA to call a timeout. The USA quickly closed the gap after falling behind by 10 points early on (25-15). Unlike their previous game against Lithuania, the USA prevented Germany from pulling away and ended the first quarter trailing by only two points.

Both teams continued their offensive prowess in the second quarter, with Mikal Bridges, Anthony Edwards, and Austin Reaves taking turns scoring for the USA. Germany displayed a balanced attack from both inside and outside, with Daniel Theis scoring 9 points in this quarter alone. The first half was a high-scoring affair, with Germany narrowly leading 60-59.

In the second half, Theis continued his hot streak, scoring six consecutive points and forcing the USA to call another timeout. However, Germany remained unfazed after the timeout, scoring 35 points in this quarter. Shooter Andreas Obst contributed 10 points on his own. The score at the end of the third quarter was 35-24 in favor of Germany, creating a ten-point difference.

In the final quarter, the USA went into comeback mode, with Jalen Brunson and Edwards making significant contributions. Germany maintained a steady scoring pace throughout the game, holding onto their ten-point lead until the last four minutes. The USA called their second timeout of the second half, leaving them with only one timeout remaining. After the timeout, Reaves made a three-pointer, and Edwards scored a three-pointer with an additional free throw, resulting in a 7-0 run for the USA and prompting Germany to call a timeout. The game intensified, with Reaves and Dennis Schroder each making two-point shots, bringing the score within three points. But with 1 minute and 14 seconds left, Obst made a crucial three-pointer. In the following possession, Isaac Bonga made a crucial block for Germany. Schroder then made a mid-range shot, extending Germany's lead to six points.

With six points to make up in the final moments, Reaves scored a layup to bring the deficit down to four points. After Germany's inbound, Bonga committed an offensive foul, resulting in a turnover. Unfortunately, Edwards made a critical turnover, squandering the opportunity to narrow the gap by four points. Even though Reaves made a successful layup in the end, it was not enough. Germany defeated the USA 113-111, advancing to the World Cup championship game. Germany's starting lineup had an outstanding performance, with shooter Andreas Obst scoring a team-high 24 points, including four three-pointers, and recording 6 assists. Dennis Schroder contributed 17 points and 9 assists, while Daniel Theis had an efficient shooting performance, scoring 21 points on 10-of-15 shooting and grabbing 7 rebounds. Franz Wagner also had a strong game, scoring 22 points and grabbing 5 rebounds.

The USA's loss can be attributed to their defense, as they allowed Germany to score 113 points. However, their offensive performance was one of the most impressive in recent games. Anthony Edwards led the team with 23 points, 8 rebounds, and 3 assists, while Austin Reaves contributed 21 points. Mikal Bridges scored 17 points, and Jalen Brunson added 15 points and 7 assists.
