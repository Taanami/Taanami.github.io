  T1 League's New Secretary-General, Wang Zhiqun, Brings a Wealth of Experience

After the resignation of former T1 League Secretary-General Zhang Shuren last week, the league wasted no time in searching for his replacement. After just one weekend, the league announced that Wang Zhiqun, former Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Basketball Association, would be taking over the position. The efficiency of the process can be considered quite high.

Wang Zhiqun is not a stranger to the T1 League, as he had previously served as the head coach of the Taoyuan Leopards in the league's first season. However, he stepped down mid-season for various reasons, and veteran coach Liu Jiafa took over the team.

After leaving the Leopards, Wang Zhiqun was recruited by the Chinese Basketball Association and served as Deputy Secretary-General. During this time, he also worked as a commentator for various leagues and utilized his own YouTube channel, "5 After Time," as a platform for self-media, which can be considered quite successful.

Wang Zhiqun has a comprehensive basketball background. He was a key player for the Dacin Tigers in the past and later coached at the first-tier level in the University Basketball Association (UBA) at Taiwan Normal University. After the establishment of the Taoyuan Leopards, he also became the team's first head coach, possessing the qualifications of a professional team head coach. Following that, he joined the basketball association as Deputy Secretary-General, responsible for national team training and assisting Secretary-General Li Yunxiang, with additional experience in uniform management.

In the T1 League's system, the Secretary-General can be considered the most important position, especially in an association-based structure where the President and Vice President are honorary roles. The Secretary-General is essentially responsible for the overall operation of the league and plays a crucial role in communicating with the Director of Competition and the Director of Strategic Marketing.

Therefore, it is a smart move to have Wang Zhiqun, who has a complete background and a fresh image, take over as Secretary-General.

The new Secretary-General of the T1 League is Wang Zhiqun, former Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Basketball Association. Please continue reading.

Regarding his appointment as the league's Secretary-General, Wang Zhiqun expressed, "Observing the league's development over the past year, it has been progressing in the right direction. Returning to the league, I hope to not only ensure stable development but also promote internationalization, fostering cooperation between the league and other countries, with the aim of significantly enhancing the league's international visibility." Regarding internal reforms in the league, Wang Zhiqun also emphasized, "In the future, we will strengthen communication between the league and teams, with the ultimate goal of mutual benefit, and prioritize the interests of the fans to create a diverse and comprehensive professional basketball environment." T1 League President Qian Weijuan said, "Zhiqun's young and promising image in the basketball industry is recognized by everyone. We can see from his attitude towards basketball during his time as a player and coach that he will develop his own style. The position of Secretary-General has been passed down from one capable individual to another, and each one is outstanding!" Indeed, as President Qian mentioned, the position of Secretary-General is a baton that is passed on. From the beginning, Zhang Yunzhi, the founder of a marketing company, helped the league establish its footing in the first year. In the second year, media professional Zhang Shuren collaborated with the newly joined Director of Strategic Marketing, Cai Shanghua, leading to significant advancements in marketing. In the third year, Wang Zhiqun, with a background in basketball and experience as a coach and in uniform management, took over, raising high expectations for his future performance.
