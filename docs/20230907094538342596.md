  NBA Eastern Conference Finals: Celtics Stage Epic Comeback, Tie Series with Heat at 3-3

The Boston Celtics, who were once down 0-3 in the Eastern Conference Finals, narrowly defeated the Miami Heat with a score of 104-103 in a nail-biting game on the 28th. With this victory, the Celtics have won three games in a row and tied the series, giving them a chance to make history.

In the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, the Miami Heat had a commanding 3-0 lead after the first three games, but the Boston Celtics fought back and won the fourth and fifth games. Going into the sixth game, the Heat led the series 3-2 in the best-of-seven format.

In a closely contested game, the Celtics took a 34-29 lead in the first quarter with strong performances from Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, who scored 10 and 9 points respectively. In the second quarter, the Celtics extended their lead to double digits at 52-41, but the Heat closed the gap with a 12-5 run. The Celtics maintained a narrow lead of 57-53 at halftime.

The Celtics' shooting efficiency, with a field goal percentage of 51.3%, was the key to their first-half lead. However, their three-point shooting was only 20%, far behind the Heat's 60%, which prevented them from pulling away.

In the second half, the Heat made a comeback and narrowed the deficit to just two points after Gabe Vincent's layup. However, the Celtics responded with baskets from Marcus Smart and Al Horford, followed by a three-pointer from Robert Williams III and free throws from Jaylen Brown, extending their lead to 13 points.

The Heat rallied again, led by Kyle Lowry's 4 consecutive points, but the Celtics finished the third quarter with a 79-72 lead.

In the fourth quarter, the Heat started strong with an 11-3 run, taking an 83-82 lead after Duncan Robinson's three-pointer and Jimmy Butler's layup. The Celtics quickly answered with an 8-0 run, regaining the lead at 90-83. Jimmy Butler struggled in the first three quarters, only making 2 of his 15 attempts, scoring just 9 points. However, he had a remarkable comeback in the fourth quarter, scoring 15 points, including three free throws in the final 3 seconds that briefly gave the Heat a 1-point lead. But Marcus Smart missed a three-pointer in the final seconds, and Derrick White made a last-second shot to secure the victory for the Celtics.

In the history of the NBA playoffs, no team has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit to win a series. However, the Celtics have shown incredible resilience by winning three consecutive games after losing the first three. If they can win Game 7 at home on the 30th, they will make history. Jayson Tatum had a game-high 31 points and 11 rebounds for the Celtics, while Jaylen Brown contributed 26 points and 10 rebounds. Marcus Smart provided a boost with 21 points. For the Heat, Jimmy Butler scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, Caleb Martin had 21 points and 15 rebounds, and Bam Adebayo recorded a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds.

The Celtics are now just one win away from becoming the first team ever to overcome a 3-0 series deficit. The decisive Game 7 will take place on Monday at 8:30 PM ET on TNT.
