  2023 Trail Blazers: No Summer Reinforcements

Nearly two months after the opening of the free agency market, the Trail Blazers have only reached an agreement with Moses Brown on a non-guaranteed contract. The team's major moves have been re-signing Jerami Grant and following up on Matisse Thybulle's offer.

With star player Damian Lillard requesting a trade, the Trail Blazers are inevitably heading towards a rebuilding phase, with Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe as the core of their roster for the upcoming season. However, the team has yet to complete a trade involving Lillard, and there have been no significant changes to the roster. Moses Brown was initially a two-way player for the Trail Blazers.

The main reason for the delay in trading Lillard is dissatisfaction with the trade offers from other teams. Although the situation is currently at a standstill, it seems unlikely that Lillard will represent the Trail Blazers in the upcoming season, whether a trade is completed before the start of the season or not.

While the team claims to wait for a satisfactory offer before completing a trade, the overall team operation has been stagnant due to the trade impasse. Currently, the Trail Blazers have only 13 players under contract, including Moses Brown on a non-guaranteed deal.

If the intention is not to acquire more players after a trade, the roster should not be so thin. Therefore, the Trail Blazers have essentially made no reinforcements in the free agency market. Compared to previous seasons where they fought for a playoff spot, the team now has less pressure in terms of performance, but the issue of a vacant paint cannot be ignored. The departures this summer include Drew Eubanks and Trendon Watford, who had the most bench minutes as the 5th man last season, but the team has only added Moses Brown as a replacement.

With starting center Jusuf Nurkic's recent injury concerns (and even uncertainty about his presence on the team at the start of the season), the frontcourt situation for the new season is precarious.

Even with the addition of Jerami Grant, the team only has five suitable forwards, one of whom is Nassir Little. The other three are rookies Kris Murray, Rayan Rupert, and sophomore Jabari Walker.

Little also has durability issues, and the other three young and inexperienced forwards can only provide limited contributions immediately. Unless something unexpected happens, the Trail Blazers will continue to rely on their backcourt players to cover the frontcourt responsibilities, as they have done in recent years. Half of the players are still on rookie contracts, and excluding Lillard, the team only has Jerami Grant and Jusuf Nurkic over the age of 27. This roster does not inspire confidence.

Although this situation allows Scoot Henderson, this year's draft pick, to have plenty of playing time, it seems that the Trail Blazers will not be competitive in the next season, especially in the highly competitive Western Conference.

The lack of depth in the frontcourt not only poses problems for the team's defense but also increases the risk of injuries as players are forced to play out of position. Even if there is no intention to increase competitiveness, the frontcourt is currently depleted to the point where there are almost no available players. Is the team really planning to play a full 82-game season with this roster?

In the past two seasons, the Trail Blazers started with ambitions of making the playoffs, only to surrender and rest their key players after a losing streak, aiming for better draft positions.

This season, it's hard to see how the Trail Blazers can compete with the stronger teams in the Western Conference in terms of frontcourt and interior strength.

Although the team hasn't explicitly stated it, their recent actions and developments resemble a "Trust The Process" approach, where they accumulate talented young players over the years. The hiring of two assistant GMs, one with experience from the Hinkie era of the 76ers, and the other a long-time draft analyst, indicates the team's clear direction. While Mike Schmitz has been performing well, it's apparent that the Trail Blazers brought him in not with the intention of contending for a championship.
