  Flying Monkey's 2223 Season Review: The Patient Shooter - Zhang Zhenya

In the 2223 season, Zhang Zhenya, the first overall pick of the draft, averaged 5 points, 1.8 rebounds, and a 33.8% three-point shooting percentage. If someone told you these were the statistics of a first-year rookie who didn't even get the chance to compete for the Rookie of the Year award, many would say he is a bust. Even Zhang Zhenya himself may not be satisfied, as he didn't meet his preseason goal of a 43% three-point shooting percentage.

Zhang Zhenya, the first overall pick of the draft, had a rough start to the season. Despite being labeled as the starting small forward for the Flying Monkeys, he seemed overwhelmed by the pressure and struggled with his weaknesses, even missing some of his usually reliable three-point shots. At one point, he even struggled to get playing time. However, the media did not label him as a bust yet, as his potential and impact were still evident. He had two games with 19 points and even made 6 three-pointers in one game. However, these flashes of brilliance were too short-lived. Please continue reading to find out more about Zhang Zhenya's disappointing start to his professional career, which may be due to various factors, including the immense pressure of being the second overall pick in the P. LEAGUE+.

However, as a professional athlete, facing pressure from fans is part of the job. The writer does not underestimate this pressure, but players must learn how to handle it effectively and find healthy ways to cope with it. Another factor that may have affected Zhang Zhenya's performance at the beginning of the season was his transition to a new role.

In National Chengchi University, Zhang Zhenya mainly played as a stretch four, relying on pick and pop plays and shooting from the outside.

It's not news for a player with his height to play the power forward position in the University Basketball Association (UBA). In fact, if he didn't play for a school with foreign players, he might have had to play as a center. It could be said that part of Zhang Zhenya's struggles with his transition was due to his environment as a player.

However, in the third season, the Flying Monkeys insisted on maintaining their advantage in the paint and often played with a twin tower lineup.

Even Huang Honghan, who has experience playing in the post, didn't get many chances to play inside. As a result, Zhang Zhenya had no choice but to transition to a new role, which affected his performance. The shooter's path requires patience and a calm mindset. Just like shooting, one cannot be impatient. In the writer's opinion, whether it's fans, the Flying Monkeys, or Zhang Zhenya himself, they all need to be patient.

And even if he is criticized, the impact a shooter can bring to the P. LEAGUE+ is significant. The Flying Monkeys' three-point shooting, which was disastrous in the second season, saw a glimmer of hope after Zhang Zhenya joined the team. The writer believes that his potential and value make him worth the investment for the Flying Monkeys. Please continue reading for the strengths and weaknesses of Zhang Zhenya.

Strengths: Shooting, agility

For a player who just finished playing in the UBA and is entering the professional league, Zhang Zhenya has some natural advantages. First, his style of play is more perimeter-oriented, and he is no stranger to shooting from beyond the three-point line. His smooth and quick shooting motion makes him a threat even when he doesn't have the ball.

Zhang Zhenya's excellent three-point shooting ability may be related to his beautiful shooting form. Even if you don't know him, you can tell from his shooting form that he is a good shooter.

Although shooting form is challenging to quantify, we still cannot prove that it affects accuracy or consistency. However, the writer believes that Zhang Zhenya's beautiful shooting form helps him become a three-point specialist.

Moreover, as someone who mainly played the power forward position in the past, Zhang Zhenya's speed and agility are enough for him to play as a small forward. For example, in the play below, Zhang Zhenya's speed and shooting after receiving the ball are exactly what a forward should have. Please continue reading for the weaknesses of Zhang Zhenya.

Weaknesses: Perimeter isolation skills, perimeter defense

Zhang Zhenya's main issue is his role. It is not ideal for a player with his size to play the power forward position in a professional league, as the majority of the time, foreign players will be playing in the paint. It is unlikely that he can match their strength and weight.

Transitioning to the small forward position seems like a reasonable strategy, but he has faced many challenges during this transition.

As mentioned earlier, Zhang Zhenya's agility and movement are enough for him to play as a small forward. In the writer's opinion, his perimeter defense is not as bad as people think. His natural athletic ability is enough for him to play as a small forward. However, he still needs to improve his basketball skills and concepts to adapt to this new role.

Whether it's attacking with the ball, driving to the basket, or facing screens, Zhang Zhenya still needs to work on these aspects. In the past, he mainly defended the screener, not the ball handler. As a result, he often struggles to keep up with his opponent's moves. Facing backdoor cuts also poses a challenge for him. Season review:

Since joining the Flying Monkeys as the first overall pick in the P.LEAGUE+ draft, Zhang Zhenya has been under immense pressure. With rumors of a high salary, the expectations for him were even higher.

However, as mentioned earlier, Zhang Zhenya still needs to go through a transition. Therefore, at the beginning of the season, the Flying Monkeys didn't immediately give him 30 minutes of playing time but let him start as a pseudo-starter.

Even with this gradual plan, Zhang Zhenya still faced challenges. In the preseason, he only made one of six three-point attempts, and it was clear that he lacked other scoring options besides shooting three-pointers. Until November 27th, Zhang Zhenya didn't play his next game after the season opener, and he only played less than 10 minutes, almost sitting at the end of the bench.

In the past decade, how many first overall picks in the P. LEAGUE+ have had a successful first season? The writer cannot think of any. However, even if Zhang Zhenya doesn't have significant growth in this aspect, the Flying Monkeys do not care as much about his defensive issues. After all, his shooting ability is undeniable.

In conclusion, Zhang Zhenya is still adapting to his new role, and it will take time for him to reach his potential. However, his natural shooting ability and agility make him a valuable asset for the Flying Monkeys, and they should continue to invest in him.
