When rookies come to the NBA, there are always things they have never experienced before or things they expect to accomplish. Today, 2023 draft pick Victor Wembanyama spoke about head coach Gregg Popovich, saying that Popovich finally yelled at him, but a little later than he expected.

Wembanyama was talking about the team's training conditions, saying that when a player on the court does something the coach told him not to do, the whole team will be called to run full-court sprints. The reporter then asked if head coach Popovich had yelled at Wembanyama, to which Wembanyama replied, "Of course, but a little later than I expected. I am grateful that he yelled at me."

Wembanyama also mentioned the fast pace of NBA training, saying that the team's training teaches them a lot of information and tactical principles that he has never seen before. He must be very focused to not miss what the team is teaching. If you lose focus for just one second, you won't know what you're doing for the next 15 minutes.

In another interview, Wembanyama also talked about the great logistical support in the NBA. He said that last year, he had to worry about a lot of things, but this year, he has less to worry about. Last year, he was not just a player, but also a GM. He had to worry about whether the floor was clean and if his teammates were doing their weights. Now, it's much easier for me.
