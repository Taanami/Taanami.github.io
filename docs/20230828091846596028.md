 The Olympic qualifiers reopened as a special exception, and the president of the Bahamas Basketball Association expressed his desire to recruit Klay Thompson for the next round.

According to a report from The Tribune, Eugene Horton, the president of the Bahamas Basketball Association, stated before the Olympic qualifiers that if the team advanced in this competition, they would seek the assistance of Golden State Warriors star Klay Thompson in the next round. The Bahamas performed exceptionally well this year and achieved their goal of advancing.

For this qualifying tournament, the Bahamas assembled two local-born players, Deandre Ayton from the Phoenix Suns and Buddy Hield from the Indiana Pacers, both of whom are stable NBA starters. Additionally, they applied to FIBA, the International Basketball Federation, to transfer Eric Gordon to the Bahamas so he could represent the country. Earlier today, they successfully advanced. The transfer process was quite complicated because Gordon previously represented the United States in the 2010 FIBA World Championship. To complete the transfer, the player must not only apply to FIBA but also have the willingness to play for the new country and coordinate with the player's original country to relinquish their future eligibility. After FIBA's approval, the player can transfer to a developing national team that benefits the basketball community the most. Eric Gordon's mother is from the Bahamas, which allows him to play for the country. During the interview, the president of the Bahamas Basketball Association expressed his focus on Golden State Warriors player Klay Thompson because Klay Thompson's father, Mychal Thompson, was also born in the Bahamas.

However, it may be difficult for Klay Thompson to transfer nationalities this time. In addition to Thompson still being in his prime, there is a chance that Steve Kerr will be selected to coach the US national team for the Paris Olympics next year. The criteria for FIBA's approval of nationality transfers is not clearly defined, so it is uncertain how many players can transfer through this rule. If there is a real opportunity for Thompson to transfer before the 2024 Olympic qualifiers, the Bahamas may have to choose between Gordon and Thompson to represent the country.
