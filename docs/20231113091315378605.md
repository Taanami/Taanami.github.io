  The Last Mile of Chicago Bulls' Preseason Journey Before Training Camp 

With the start of the 2023-24 season approaching, players invited to various team training camps will soon face a wave of cuts.

The training camp roster can expand up to 21 players, but will be reduced to 15 players at the start of the season, with a maximum of 3 two-way contracts. This year, the Bulls have only invited three free agents to participate in training camp: forward Quenton Jackson, guard Max Heidegger, and rising star from Estonia, Henri Drell. Quenton is the only one with NBA experience.

As we approach the start of training camp, the Bulls currently have 15 players under contract (including non-guaranteed contracts for Terry Taylor and Carlik Jones) and 3 players signed to two-way contracts: Adama Sanogo, Onuralp Bitim, and Justin Lewis.

The journey to make the final roster is not an easy one for Quenton and the other two players.

6'5" wing player Quenton Jackson was a undrafted rookie last year, graduating from Texas A&M University. He was signed to a two-way contract with the Wizards and played in 9 games. He was also supposed to play in the summer league for the Wizards, but was released at the end of July.

His primary goal with the Bulls should be to compete for a two-way contract, while Justin Lewis will be trying to secure his spot on the roster, making Quenton a potential threat.

Max Heidegger, also 6'3", was an undrafted rookie in 2020, graduating from UC Santa Barbara where he was a key player. He has spent the past three years playing in Europe and participated in the summer league for the Hawks in 2020-21 and 2021-22, but did not make the regular season roster.

This will be his first time participating in training camp. Interestingly, Heidegger reportedly signed with Italian team Reyer Venezia on July 22, but a month later, he signed with the Bulls. It is unclear if the previous signing was a mistake.

Max will face tougher competition for a two-way or regular contract compared to Quenton, as there are already talented players like Carlik Jones at his position. He may end up playing in the G League or even overseas in Italy.

The developments mentioned above have come to fruition. Heidegger and Drell were waived on October 13, while Quenton was released yesterday (October 17).

Out of the three players, Quenton got the most playing time and even played in the Bulls' double-overtime win against the Nuggets, coming in midway through the fourth quarter and staying on until the end of the second overtime. Before being waived, Quenton played in all three preseason games, averaging 8.7 minutes, 5 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game. He shot 2-for-3 from the three-point line and had some impressive dunks, such as the one against the Bucks:

And the one that even impressed LaVine:

Despite showing off his athleticism, Quenton was unable to beat out Lewis for a two-way contract, which is a shame for him. As for Heidegger and Drell, they only played in the first preseason game against the Bucks, with Heidegger scoring 1 point from a free throw and Drell not recording any stats. In the early stages of the preseason, Drell had 1 assist and 2 fouls.

Heidegger and Drell both have the potential to play in Europe. Heidegger had already signed with Reyer Venezia in the Italian league. So even though he signed an Exhibit 10 contract this time, he may not end up in the Bulls' G League team.

Drell has played for the Windy City Bulls for two seasons, and his invitation to training camp this year shows that the Bulls' front office has noticed his potential and is giving him another chance to pursue his dream. However, this is just the beginning. After releasing Quenton and the other two players, the Bulls signed former Jazz center Derrick Favors and 22-year-old forward Kahlil Whitney to training camp contracts.

Despite being a seasoned veteran, Favors is in need of a platform to showcase his skills. He was the 3rd overall pick in the 2010 draft, but was traded to the Jazz by the Nets before he even finished his rookie season.

He spent 10 years with the Jazz and worked his way up from Gobert's backup to his frontcourt partner.

Favors is one of the examples of players who struggled to adapt to the small-ball era.

He is 6'10" and weighs 265 pounds, which is a far cry from his days with the Nets when he was known for his lower body strength and explosive performance.

However, he is still agile, has good ball-handling skills, and a good passing vision.

Moreover, he has played alongside Gobert for a significant amount of time with the Jazz, so he should have some familiarity with the modern big man defense.

Favors had some solid seasons with the Jazz, showing his potential.

But he was still only a reserve player on a strong Jazz team.

By joining the Bulls, he hopes to recreate the same chemistry he had with Gobert.

Whitney, on the other hand, was the 3rd overall pick in 2021, selected by the Bucks, then traded to the Rockets, who then traded him to the Bulls.

Whitney was also considered for a contract with the Lakers, but was waived during the preseason. He also played for the Greensboro Swarm in the G League.

He is 6'6" and weighs 210 pounds, making him a suitable small forward, but he is actually more of a wing player.

His height is average for a wing player, but his weight is on the lighter side, which is his biggest obstacle in the NBA.

Whitney and Favors both have good ball-handling skills and are agile, but their light weight is a disadvantage, and they are not shooters, which makes it difficult for them to find a spot in the modern NBA.

Whitney will most likely stay in the G League, while Favors will be a key player for the Bulls.

This also shows that the Bulls' frontcourt is relatively weak.

Although they have an All-Star caliber player in LaVine, the rest of the frontcourt is barren.

Although LaVine can play as a small forward on offense, his height is a disadvantage on defense, so he can only play as a wing player at best.

Favors can play as a small forward, but his height is also a disadvantage, so he can only play as a wing player at best.

The starting forward positions are taken by Vucevic and Troy Brown Jr., both of whom are big men.

LaVine and Favors will be the only wing players.

This configuration is an improvement from last year.

Last year, the Bulls' lineup was like this: two big men and two LaVines.

Last year's LaVine was still missing someone else.

The Bulls' frontcourt is not held together by LaVine's offensive abilities, but by Vucevic's defensive abilities. Vucevic's height disadvantage is actually an advantage on defense.

Favors has joined the Bulls to fill this position.

Whitney will most likely stay in the G League.

After all, he is undersized and not a shooter.

So his playing time in the NBA will be limited.

We hope he can find his place in the G League.
