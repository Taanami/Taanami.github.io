 Proud of the Li family: NBA player Kyle Anderson named Li Kai'er becomes the first naturalized basketball player in China

On the 24th, the Chinese Basketball Association announced that Kyle Anderson, who currently plays for the NBA's Timberwolves, has officially become a Chinese citizen, becoming China's first naturalized foreign basketball player. He also announced on social media that he will wear the Chinese national team jersey to participate in the FIBA Basketball World Cup in August.

Kyle Anderson was born in Fairview, New Jersey, USA. In the 2014 NBA Draft, he was selected by the Spurs in the first round as the 30th pick and played for them for 4 years.

He has played for the Spurs, Grizzlies, and Timberwolves throughout his career. Anderson is 206 cm tall and weighs 104 kg. He has an impressive wingspan of 220 cm. In the previous season, he played 69 games for the Timberwolves, averaging 9.4 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.9 blocks per game. He also had a three-point shooting percentage of 41% and a field goal percentage of 50.9%.

In international competitions, Anderson has previously participated in the USA U16 and U17 training camps but has never represented the USA in games. This qualification aligns with FIBA's requirements for naturalized players, giving him the opportunity to switch nationalities and play for China. Anderson's connection to China comes from his maternal ancestry. His great-grandfather was a Chinese immigrant, giving him one-eighth Chinese heritage.

Five years ago in 2018, he traveled to China with his mother to explore his roots and left the name Li Kai'er on his family's genealogy. It was then that news spread about the Chinese Basketball Association actively targeting Anderson as a naturalized player. After announcing his Chinese citizenship on the 24th, Anderson shared his journey of becoming a Chinese citizen on Weibo under the account name "Big Hammer Li Kai'er." He recalled that the root-seeking trip in 2018 was very important to him, as it showed him where his roots lie and how deep they are. He also expressed pride and honor in having his name written in the Li family genealogy.

He also announced on social media that he will represent the Chinese national team in the upcoming FIBA Basketball World Cup in August.

With Anderson becoming Li Kai'er, he becomes China's first naturalized basketball player. This not only involves a change in China's basketball style but also accelerates the transformation of Chinese basketball.

Sports commentator Li Yishen believes that Anderson is an all-around player who can handle the ball, control the game, and pass effectively. He has a high basketball IQ and can activate China's inside game with his height and playmaking ability. Especially since China lacks sufficient power and defensive presence in the inside, Anderson's addition can help the tall players in the team by creating space, organizing plays, and creating scoring opportunities.

However, Anderson's joining also brings concerns. Although he comes from the NBA, he does not possess the explosive athleticism or one-on-one scoring ability commonly seen in international competitions. It remains to be seen whether Anderson's unique playing style and slower pace can fit into China's basketball system. Li Yishen believes that Anderson is not the solution for the Chinese men's basketball team. Although he is unique, he is not an NBA superstar who can dominate major opponents in Asia by relying solely on ball handling, superhuman drives, and individual scoring. China needs top-level coaches and has room for improvement in player skills, physical training systems, and more.
