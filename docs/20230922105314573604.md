  NBATreyMurphy to undergo surgery for meniscus injury, will miss the start of the season

New Orleans Pelicans forward Trey Murphy suffered a meniscus injury during a game on Wednesday. He immediately underwent evaluation and treatment, and the results are now in. Murphy has decided to undergo surgery and is expected to be out for 10-12 weeks. The earliest he could return is in mid-November, which means he will definitely miss the start of the season.

There are two ways to handle a meniscus injury, and Murphy has chosen surgery, which requires a longer recovery time. This will have an impact on the Pelicans' frontline strength at the beginning of the season. Murphy, who averaged 14.5 points and 3.6 rebounds per game last season, is a young player that the Pelicans have been focusing on developing.
