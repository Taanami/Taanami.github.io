  NBADeRozan on three-point shooting: I don't need to make changes, only 38 people score more than me

DeMar DeRozan is undoubtedly an outstanding mid-range scorer and dunker, but his three-point shooting is not considered exceptional. However, it seems that he has no intention of changing to adapt to the trend. DeRozan recently gave an interview, where some opinions suggested that he should take more three-point shots. DeRozan responded, "I don't need to make any changes. In NBA history, only 38 people have scored more than me in total." He continued, "I'm not saying that I don't need to shoot three-pointers. However, I'm also not saying that I have to shoot 10 three-pointers every night. I don't have that mindset. I will still stay in my comfort zone and do what I do well. When there is an opportunity for a three-pointer, I will take it. I'm not saying that I won't shoot." Throughout his career, DeRozan has averaged 21.0 points per game (with a shooting percentage of 46.8%), and he is currently at his best while playing for the Chicago Bulls.
