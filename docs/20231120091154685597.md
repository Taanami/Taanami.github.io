 Recently, during a preseason game between the Wizards and Knicks, a play caught the attention of many online. In the play, Jordan Poole had the ball for the Wizards and Deni Avdija was open for a pass, but Poole decided to take the shot himself instead of passing it to Avdija. The shot missed and Avdija could be seen putting his hands up in frustration before getting back on defense. This moment sparked a lot of discussion online. When asked about it, Kyle Kuzma didn't seem too concerned and said, "It's nothing. Deni was probably a little frustrated at the time, we all get frustrated, you just can't show it. But it's all love between us."
