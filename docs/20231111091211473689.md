The 2023 FIBA World Cup saw a rematch between the United States and Lithuania, with the latter handing the former their first loss of the tournament. Despite the absence of key player Domantas Sabonis, Lithuania, a small country with a strong basketball tradition, was able to capitalize on the weaknesses of the American team.

In the past, Lithuania has always been a tough opponent for the United States in international competitions such as the Olympics and the World Cup. However, due to groupings and other factors, the two teams have not met each other in recent years. The last time they faced each other was in the 2014 World Cup, where Lithuania managed to defeat the US team in the preliminary round.

In fact, Lithuania almost made history in the 2000 Sydney Olympics when they came close to defeating the US team in the semi-finals. It was not until two years later, in the 2002 World Championship, that Argentina's Manu Ginobili became the first player to lead a team to victory against a fully NBA-stacked American team.

In this game, both teams had already secured their spot in the knockout round. However, it was still an important game for both teams to maintain their momentum and show their strength. Lithuania, without Sabonis, was able to utilize their disciplined and strategic play to create mismatches and capitalize on their opponent's weaknesses.

The absence of Sabonis also allowed for a return to traditional team dynamics with a focus on defense and team play. Lithuania's well-rounded roster and deep bench also gave them an advantage over the US team, which heavily relied on individual talents and athleticism.

Despite being down by 19 points in the first quarter, the US team did not give up and fought back in the second half. However, their efforts were not enough to overcome the deficit, and the game ended with a 94-102 victory for Lithuania.

In the end, the American team's shortcomings in terms of teamwork and defense were exposed, while Lithuania's strategic approach and disciplined play paid off. It was a tough loss for the US team, but they showed great determination and resilience until the very end.
