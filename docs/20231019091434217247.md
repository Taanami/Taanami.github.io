Liu Zheng and Abasi combined for 26 points in the first half, while Lin Ting-qian scored 11 points in the third quarter, helping the team to a 22-point lead after three quarters and ultimately winning 83-62 to secure a spot in the top 8.

 With a total of 16 teams participating in the Asian Games men's basketball, the Chinese team lost to the host team, but managed to secure the second spot in Group B after a thrilling victory against Mongolia in the final game. Today, they faced Kazakhstan, the third place team in Group A, in the quarterfinals. Only the winning team would advance to the top 8. The Chinese team started off with an 11-2 lead, with Liu Zheng scoring 6 points. The team continued to score from the free throw line with Atinuo and Abasi, who scored 6 points in a row, extending the lead to 16-5.

 Led by Abasi's 8 points, the Chinese team had a 20-11 lead in the first quarter. Lu Jun-xiang started off the second quarter with a three-pointer, but Kazakhstan's outside shooting also heated up, closing the gap to 17-23. However, Liu Zheng hit 2 consecutive three-pointers and Abasi also fired from outside, along with Atinuo's scoring under the basket, the Chinese team extended their lead to 37-22. They maintained a 44-26 lead at halftime. In the first half, Liu Zheng scored 12 points, Abasi scored 14 points, both shooting 4 for 2 from the three-point line, totaling 26 points, which was equal to Kazakhstan's total score.

 After Atinuo completed a "three-point play" in the third quarter, Lin Ting-qian followed with a high toss, extending the Chinese team's lead to 51-30. After 4 minutes, Lin Ting-qian and Abasi performed an "air relay". Abasi was originally going for a dunk, but was affected by the defender and could only put the ball in the basket, causing the audience at the Olympic Sports Center Stadium to exclaim in surprise.

 The alley-oop that Abasi couldn't complete was completed by Zeng Xiang-jun on the next offensive, as he received a floor pass from Lin Ting-qian and made a powerful dunk, extending the Chinese team's lead to 57-35 and forcing Kazakhstan to call a timeout. The timeout couldn't cool down Lin Ting-qian's hot hand, as he scored 11 points in the quarter. Together with Zeng Xiang-jun's double-handed dunk, the Chinese team led 66-44 after three quarters. In the fourth quarter, Li Qi-wei hit a three-pointer and Lu Jun-xiang made a "backdoor" layup, continuing to extend the Chinese team's lead, ultimately winning 83-62. Lin Ting-qian scored 19 points, while Abasi and Liu Zheng had 18 points and 12 points respectively, with all three players resting in the final quarter.

 The Chinese team that successfully secured a spot in the top 8 will face the top team in Group D, Japan, at 8 PM tomorrow. The winning team will advance to the top 4, while the losing team will compete for 5th to 8th place.
