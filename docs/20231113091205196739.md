  Flying Apes' 2223 Season: The Underwhelming Performance of Veteran Sonny

In the third game of the playoffs between the Flying Apes and the Warriors, 40-year-old Lin Chih-Chieh once again showed his dominance on the court. He scored 29 points and led his team to eliminate the Flying Apes in their home court.

This performance perfectly showcased the value of a veteran player in the playoffs. However, for the young and inexperienced players on the Flying Apes team, it was too much to expect them to match Lin's level.

The team had hoped that their most experienced and intelligent player, Tsakuragi Shinsuke, would display the same veteran presence as Lin did. Unfortunately, throughout the season, we did not see Tsakuragi deliver such performances. In fact, in crucial moments, it was players like Huang Hong-Han and Lu Jun-Xiang who stepped up, while Tsakuragi was nowhere to be found.

Compared to the initial expectations when he joined the team, there was a considerable gap in Tsakuragi's performance. When the Flying Apes announced that they had signed Tsakuragi as their next foreign player during the off-season, it was widely praised as a safe and strategic move by the management. After all, Tsakuragi had played in Taiwan before and was familiar with the local style of play. Additionally, he had previously worked with coach Caminos on the T1 League's Taichung Suns, and together they had led the team to the championship series.

However, the end result did not live up to these expectations, and it seemed that the chemistry between Tsakuragi and the Flying Apes was not the same as what they had during their time with the Suns.

Tsakuragi also seemed unhappy with his role on the team. After the season ended, he posted a cryptic message, suggesting that the Flying Apes' inability to win was due to not playing their best players.

While I agree with this statement to some extent, it is not entirely the fault of the coaching staff. Please continue reading to learn more about the team's first half of the season.

During the first half of the season, the Flying Apes were known for their ability to perform well in the fourth quarter. This was because they mostly stuck with a single foreign player on the court, allowing the players to have better chemistry and familiarity with each other. However, in the second half of the season, coach Caminos started using a younger lineup, and the team often struggled in the fourth quarter, often losing leads that they had built in the first three quarters.

Caminos' decision to use younger players may have been the phenomenon that Tsakuragi mentioned in his post. However, there were reasons behind Caminos' choices. During that time, several key players were in a slump, and even if Tsakuragi had played, it would not have changed the outcome of the game. During the playoffs, Tsakuragi also showed a lack of aggressiveness on offense.

Ultimately, it is not easy to fully utilize the value of a veteran player. Furthermore, it seems that Caminos does not rely on the conventional wisdom of experience in crucial moments. Instead, he tends to rely on players who are performing well on that particular day, regardless of their experience. In many crucial moments, we saw Tsakuragi on the bench.

It is worth mentioning that Tsakuragi is known for his ability to score in various ways despite his height of only 6-8. He constantly uses fake moves to confuse defenders and has a high basketball IQ. He also has a good mix of inside, mid-range, and three-point shots, making him a threat from anywhere on the court. He also has the strength to finish through contact, making it difficult for defenders to stop him.

However, his defensive abilities are not as impressive. It is challenging for him to defend in the paint due to his height, and his wingspan is not exceptional. This makes it difficult for him to protect the rim. On the other hand, when defending against pick-and-rolls, his smaller size can be an advantage.

Despite not focusing on defense, the Flying Apes' team defense was still solid with Tsakuragi on the court. During their 10-game winning streak, he also showed good communication and help defense. However, even with his many strengths, Tsakuragi was the foreign player with the least amount of playing time on the Flying Apes. I believe this may be because his role on the court overlaps with that of J. Washburn's. Additionally, his high turnover rate may not be favored by coach Caminos, as the team's slower pace was partly due to their efforts to reduce turnovers. Tsakuragi's style of play requires a significant amount of ball possession, but giving him too much freedom may also be risky, as he also had the highest turnover rate on the team.

In conclusion, utilizing the value of a veteran player is not a simple task. I believe that finding a balance in the team's playing style to allow Tsakuragi more opportunities to shine could make the Flying Apes a stronger team. His veteran presence could prove crucial in important games, leading the team to more stable victories.
