The Miami Heat's training camp caught attention not only for Jimmy Butler's hairstyle but also for a comment made by veteran player Kyle Lowry during media day. Lowry spoke about the league's new rules regarding flopping, stating, "I won't fake fouls, and I'm not worried about the changes in the league's rules." However, after making this statement, Lowry faced a backlash from numerous internet users who responded with videos.

The league recently implemented rules against flopping, where players who fake fouls will receive a technical foul, and the opposing team will be awarded one free throw and possession of the ball. Another topic of discussion surrounding Lowry is his role for the upcoming season. He anticipates being the starting point guard for the Miami Heat, although he hasn't discussed it yet. Lowry believes that his dedication and training will earn him a starting position. At 36 years old, Lowry has been in the league for 17 years. Last season, he played 55 games, starting in 44 of them, averaging 11.2 points and 5.1 assists per game. This season will be Lowry's final year under contract with the Miami Heat.
