The South District Finals MVP was awarded to Ocean Stormers' player Chen Bo Yu. As the commanding guard, he effectively organized the offense and contributed to scoring in the championship game. His all-around performance truly deserved the MVP recognition. The Ocean Stormers have a solid lineup with multiple players capable of slam dunks, and they are supported by an enthusiastic cheering squad on the sidelines. The team atmosphere is truly admirable!

In this year's national tournament, the Ocean Stormers finished with one win and two losses. They lost to strong opponents by only one or two points in each game. Perhaps there is a slight sense of regret in the players' hearts, but we believe that the experiences gained from these two matches go beyond mere victory or defeat. Every game was a good game.

The future of the Ocean Stormers players is primarily focused on furthering their education. Therefore, they cherish this stage where they can compete with other teams and hope that the TGF Championship this year will bring them a different experience. Farewell to the TGF stage in the future!
