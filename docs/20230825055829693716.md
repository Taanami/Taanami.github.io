  2024 Hall of Fame Inductees Announced Who Will Receive the Highest Honor

The 2023 Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame Awards Ceremony recently concluded, and the preliminary list of players selected for the 2024 Hall of Fame was announced yesterday (18th). The players who received the preliminary selection are Carter, Crawford, Billups, Noah, Stoudemire, and Marion. Carter, known for his explosive dunks, is famous worldwide for his memorable "Death Dunk" over Weis, a 218cm tall French center, during the 2000 Olympics. His elbow-in-the-rim dunk in the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest is also a classic moment. Carter is the first player in history to have played in four decades, from the 1990s to the 2020s. He has been selected as an All-Star eight times, made the All-NBA Team twice, named the Player of the Month three times, and was the Rookie of the Year in 1999. Throughout his NBA career, Carter played in 1541 games and achieved impressive averages of 16.7 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.1 assists. He is highly regarded as a potential Hall of Fame inductee in 2024. 

Crawford is famous for his flashy dribbling skills and is hailed by fans as "J.Crossover" for his unique "Shake and Bake" moves. After being selected as the 8th overall pick in the first round of the 2000 NBA Draft, Crawford primarily played as a starter in the early stages of his career. However, after joining the Atlanta Hawks in 2009, he mostly served as the team's sixth man. Despite the drastic change in his role, Crawford not only accepted it without complaint but also excelled as a sixth man. He won the Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2010, 2014, and 2016.

Billups, known as "Mr. Big Shot," is highly respected for his tenacious defense and clutch performances. The highlight of his career was in 2004 when he averaged 21 points and 5.2 assists in the NBA Finals, helping the Detroit Pistons win the championship that year. He also earned the Finals MVP award. Billups won the NBA Sportsmanship Award in 2009 and the NBA Teammate of the Year Award in 2013. He has been selected as an All-Star five times, made the All-NBA Team three times, and is currently the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.

Noah, known for his passionate play, had an outstanding college career, winning consecutive NCAA championships in 2006 and 2007. After entering the NBA, he won several defensive awards and was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2014. He has been selected as an All-Star twice, made the All-NBA Team once, and has been named to the All-Defensive Team three times. Unfortunately, injuries plagued him in the later years of his career, and he only played in 672 games, which is fewer than the other inductees.

Stoudemire, also known as "STAT," was one of the few high school players to jump straight to the NBA. In his rookie season, he averaged 13.5 points and 8.8 rebounds per game, outshining the number one pick Yao Ming and winning the 2003 NBA Rookie of the Year award. He has been selected as an All-Star six times and made the All-NBA Team five times. Throughout his career, Stoudemire averaged 18.9 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game.

Marion, known as the "Matrix," was a versatile player who could guard positions one to five. Although he never made it onto the All-Defensive Team, his impressive performances against legendary stars like Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett are deeply ingrained in fans' memories. He won the NBA championship in 2011, was selected as an All-Star four times, and made the All-NBA Team twice.
