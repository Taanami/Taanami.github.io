The "Just got off the bull's head but still on the mind" series focuses on players who recently left the Chicago Bulls and moved on to other teams. The first article in this series discussed Lauri Markkanen and was completed last September. I am glad to see that his performance with the Utah Jazz this year has validated my belief in him.

Now, let's talk about Wendell Carter Jr., who was traded to the Orlando Magic in the trade involving Nikola Vucevic. However, I would like to focus on a different aspect of this trade, rather than just evaluating its success or failure based on their current performance, along with Franz Wagner. I am more interested in discussing whether the Bulls had better options at the time. 

Before we delve into the discussion, let's remove all references to editors' names and photo descriptions. 

One issue that led to the trade dilemma is the development problem (1) Was it all his fault? Before discussing Wendell Carter Jr.'s trade, let's take a look at WCJ when he was traded and WCJ after joining the Orlando Magic. Can they be compared? When the Bulls traded WCJ, he was criticized by many Bulls fans for his on-court performance, believing that the 7th overall pick was wasted. However, I personally didn't share the same view. I believed that WCJ was indeed facing difficulties and obstacles, but it was due to factors such as the coaching staff and the team's roster, rather than solely his own capabilities. 

Before we continue, let's address a concept. A phenomenon is often caused by multiple factors with varying degrees of effects. When we mentioned earlier that WCJ couldn't overcome the coaching staff and roster's challenges, it doesn't mean that the player has no autonomy or responsibility to solve the problem. It's about determining the extent to which the player should be held accountable under reasonable circumstances. Bringing up this concept is because we need to discuss who should be responsible for WCJ's difficulties, and many people believe it is Jim Boylen. However, I have a slightly different view.

(2) Friend, do you remember a character named Wang Yuyan in Jin Yong's novels, who had no martial arts skills but could significantly enhance the effectiveness of her side's combat through her understanding of martial arts and guidance? Sometimes, you can find players in the NBA who possess similar characteristics. Their unique skills, talents, and interpretation of the game allow them to enhance the collective performance of their teammates beyond their individual talents. They act as glue guys and catalysts, bringing together various aspects of the game and catalyzing better chemistry on the court. If you find such a rare player, wouldn't you consider maximizing their potential through roster configuration? Good examples include Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo, while examples with less success include Lonzo Ball and Otto Porter Jr. in the Chicago Bulls. Regarding Otto Porter Jr., aside from his recent contribution as an important bench player in the Golden State Warriors' 2021-22 championship season, does he possess the unique qualities I described earlier? When Porter Jr. was traded from the Washington Wizards to the Bulls during the 2018-19 season, he had the following stats: 
- Points: 17.5 
- Rebounds: 5.5 
- Assists: 2.7 
- Steals: 1.2 
- Blocks: 0.6 
- Shooting percentages: 48.3% / 48.8% / 90.6% 
- Average of 2.6 three-pointers made per game. 

In qualitative terms, during that time, OPJ was a versatile forward who could defend from the wing to the rim, serve as a secondary defender, and act as a defensive leader. He had ball-handling skills, transition playmaking abilities, perimeter passing, and a complete offensive arsenal. He had a high shooting accuracy for both pull-up and catch-and-shoot situations.
