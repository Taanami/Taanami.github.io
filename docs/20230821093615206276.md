 Jones Cup: Chinese White Team Secures Victory in the Fourth Quarter, Finishes Sixth in the Tournament

In the last day of the Jones Cup, the second-to-last game featured a match between the Chinese White Team and the Iranian Team. The Chinese White Team's last victory was a week ago, so their goal for today was to end the tournament on a high note with another win.

The Chinese White Team carried their momentum from yesterday's game against the South Korean Team and performed better both offensively and defensively than in their previous games. They took a 12-6 lead with contributions from Ma Jianhao, Chen Fan Boyan, and Hong Kaijie. The first quarter ended with the Chinese White Team leading 25-15.

In the second quarter, the White Team maintained their lead with two fast break layups and a three-pointer from Hong Kaijie. However, the Iranian Team's offense picked up, scoring multiple three-pointers. The White Team had to call two timeouts and temporarily lost their lead, with the score at halftime being 8 points in favor of the White Team.

In the second half, the He brothers continued to contribute to the White Team's scoring, but the Iranian Team still applied significant pressure. They displayed great patience in handling each possession. With just over 3 minutes left, Ma Jianhao's fast break dunk ignited the crowd, but the Iranian Team managed to close the gap. The third quarter ended with a 3-point difference, setting the stage for the final quarter.

At the start of the last quarter, He Dan immediately hit two consecutive three-pointers, and He Bo's fast break dunk broke the stalemate. Ma Jianhao then added another three-pointer, giving the White Team a 6-point lead with 2 minutes remaining. In a crucial moment with 1 minute and 29 seconds left, Ma Jianhao made a turnaround fadeaway shot. Bai Yaocheng scored by cutting inside on the left, but Iran managed to score three points and draw a foul to close the gap to 2 points. A turnover occurred during the inbound pass with 2 points remaining.

Fortunately, after Iran's timeout, the White Team successfully defended against Iran's offense. Chen Fan Boyan calmly made two free throws after being fouled, and Iran once again missed their shot. The game ended with a 91-86 victory for the White Team, breaking their five-game losing streak and finishing the tournament with a record of 3 wins and 5 losses. He Bo scored the highest with 18 points, followed by He Dan and Ma Jianhao with 14 points each, Chen Fan Boyan with 13 points, and Ban Ba with 10 points.
