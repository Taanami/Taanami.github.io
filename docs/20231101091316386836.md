Taiwan's men's basketball team lost to the host Mainland team with a score of 69-89 in the "Straits Derby" today, crushing their goal of securing the top spot in the group for the Hangzhou Asian Games. The 39-year-old veteran Wen-Ding Tseng admitted that the team has made progress during their long training period, but "to be honest, it's still not enough."

Taiwan's men's basketball team has been training together since June this year, from the Japan training camp to the Jones Cup and a two-week trip to Australia, and now the results at the Hangzhou Asian Games. Although they won their first game against Hong Kong, they struggled with their offense in the first half and suffered a 20-point defeat. Speaking frankly, Tseng, who has returned to the national team, said, "We have been training for so long and there has been progress, but to be honest, it's still not enough. We need to get better and better and help each other improve in the limited time we have."

Tseng pointed out the problem, mentioning that all the players on Taiwan's team are key players in their respective clubs, but when they join the national team, they have to change their roles and mindset, and find ways to contribute within the limited time and ball possession. Taiwan's team has been plagued by injuries to their backcourt this year, with their original point guard Ying-Chun Chen absent due to injury, leaving Lin Ting-Qian, who usually plays as a shooting guard, to "save the day" and take on the role of commander. He self-critically assessed his performance as a point guard today as "failing", and acknowledged the many flaws in the first two games of the group stage, promising to reflect and improve. Lin Ting-Qian, 23, joined the CBA draft in 2020, played for the Tianjin Ronggang Pioneer team, and recently announced his three-year top salary contract extension with Tianjin in July. He has also become the target of Mainland media attention. Lin Ting-Qian mentioned that after three seasons in the CBA, he expected there to be high-intensity physical battles in today's game, but the actual experience on the court was not much different from the CBA. However, the atmosphere at the Asian Games and the CBA league are completely different, and the referees have different standards, making it a unique experience.
