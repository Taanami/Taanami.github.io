  The 2023 World Cup: The Failure of Team USA, Not NBA

The 2023 World Cup came to a close with Germany defeating Serbia in the championship game, securing a perfect record of eight wins and claiming the title. Germany's victory placed them at the top of the world in the 2023 World Cup, with Dennis Schroder, a retired NBA player and FIBA World Cup ambassador, receiving the MVP award from Carmelo Anthony.

Moving on, let's take a look at the final four teams of the 2019 World Cup who failed to make it to the quarterfinals this time around. Spain, the champions in 2019, will have to go through qualification matches to secure their spot in the Olympics. Argentina, who finished second in the 2019 World Cup, was eliminated early in the Olympic qualification tournament and will not be seen wearing their blue and white jerseys in 2024. France, finishing in third place, as the host country, is guaranteed a spot, while Australia, finishing in fourth place, is the highest-ranked team from Oceania in this World Cup. Both teams will be present at the 2024 Olympics. The final eight teams in the Tokyo Olympics were Italy, France, Slovenia, Germany, the United States, Spain, Australia, and Argentina, with only four of them making it to the quarterfinals of this World Cup.

This demonstrates that the gap between countries in FIBA is very narrow, and any slight mistake can lead to elimination. Every country is cautious and fearful in such top-tier competitions. Despite having the most NBA players, the United States and Canada, who have the second-highest number, only met in the third-place game, indicating that having NBA players is no longer a guarantee of victory.

However, looking at the awards of this tournament, all the players in the First Team were from the NBA, and three players in the Second Team are currently playing in the NBA, with only Arturs Zagars from Latvia and Nikola Milutinov from Serbia not in the NBA.

The Best Defensive Player, Dillon Brooks, and the Rising Star, Josh Giddey, are also current NBA players. Before the quarterfinals of the knockout stage, FIBA's official website released the second phase of the World Cup MVP rankings, with Luka Doncic at the top, followed by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Anthony Edwards, and Dennis Schroder. Arturs Zagars was the only player in the top five who is not currently playing in the NBA. Moving forward, let's continue reading about the disappointment of Team USA in this World Cup, but not the NBA league as a whole.

The NBA remains the most talented and competitive basketball league in the world and can be rightly called the pinnacle of basketball.

Considering the huge revenue gap between the NBA and European basketball leagues, it is unlikely that the NBA's dominance will change in the short term, leaving other basketball leagues far behind. The United States has suffered two consecutive World Cup defeats, and the main reason behind this is the increasing internationalization of the NBA.

Over a quarter of NBA players come from various countries worldwide, and while internationalization helps in developing the market, it also increases the strength of basketball in different countries.

In the NBA, the mainstream requires big men to be able to shoot and create space, set screens, execute handoffs, and provide high-level playmaking. Defensively, the focus is on switching, covering a large area, and disrupting opponents.

American big men are becoming less skilled in traditional tasks such as rebounding and positioning. Whether it's a problem with player selection or Steve Kerr's bias, the scarcity of American big men who fit the international trend, coupled with the absence of unique players like Draymond Green, has led to the inefficiency of using a small-ball lineup without a traditional center like Paolo Banchero. Having NBA stars is no longer a guarantee of victory, as it is a fact that winning in FIBA games requires team play.

The United States persists in training methods that go against the mainstream, and the result of hastily assembling a team is a performance similar to the top teams in FIBA. Moving on, in the first round, they faced Greece, followed by Montenegro and Lithuania in the second round. In the knockout stage, they faced Italy and Germany. Out of the five games against European countries, the United States won three and lost two.

The semifinal against Germany was a classic encounter, with the Germans displaying no fear of the United States' physical advantage in a fast-paced game. They competed fiercely and emerged as winners, proving that European teams can defeat the United States without relying on dominance in the paint or controlling the pace of the game. Although Team USA was not at its best in this tournament, even with a stronger roster, there is no guarantee of ultimate success.

In the previous World Cup, Team USA had the worst performance in history, and the late legendary player Kobe Bryant stated in an interview that it is not easy for the United States to win on the world stage, as the era of the 1992 Barcelona Dream Team has passed. After the third-place game, head coach Kerr admitted his failure, saying, "Every year, players come and go, making it difficult for the United States to establish continuity. The NBA is very different from FIBA, and we must study and relearn how to win FIBA games."

Basketball has globalized over the past 30 years, and teams from various countries have become stronger. Winning the World Cup or the Olympics is not an easy task.

The decline of American-born superstars is also a contributing factor. In recent years, the MVP recipients have all been foreign-born players, with the last American-born player to win the award being James Harden in the 2017-18 season while playing for the Houston Rockets.

Sending immature players to compete in FIBA games has exposed their weaknesses. For example, this time, Anthony Edwards, who scored the most points, possesses explosiveness and a good touch, but he lacks the ability to draw defensive attention and create space for his teammates. The lack of skilled big men for screens is a problem, but after setting a screen, Edwards can only create scoring opportunities for himself, and he struggles to read the overall defense, failing to stretch the opponents' defensive line.
