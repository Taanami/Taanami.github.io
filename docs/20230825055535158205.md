 The World Cup warm-up match between Japan and France took place today. Japan took an early lead in the first quarter, but ultimately France won the game with a score of 88-70.

Rudy Gobert, the center for the Minnesota Timberwolves, contributed 16 points and 9 rebounds to the fifth-ranked French team. Keisei Tominaga, the NCAA star from Japan, scored the highest of the game with 20 points for the 36th-ranked Japanese team.

The French team, consisting of current and former NBA players, is one of the toughest opponents in this tournament. It was initially expected that France would dominate Japan in this game, but Japan displayed a strong playing style, giving fans hope for an upset victory against a European team.

With Japan's star player, Yuta Watanabe, absent due to injury, the Japanese team relied on shooter Keisei Tominaga to provide offensive firepower. The 22-year-old guard played exceptionally well, hitting a three-pointer to bring the score to 3-7 and continued to ignite the enthusiasm of the 13,009 spectators with multiple shots beyond the three-point line. With the advantage of forcing turnovers and making three-pointers, Japan took the lead twice, ending the first quarter trailing 20-23 and keeping the score close at 40-45 at the end of the second quarter.

At the start of the third quarter, France extended their lead to 53-44, but Japan continued to narrow the gap with their shooting. Led by Gobert, Evan Fournier of the New York Knicks, and former San Antonio Spurs player Nando de Colo, France launched a 25-17 offensive in the third quarter, taking control of the game.

"I felt like we had a chance to win until halftime," said Tom Hovasse, the head coach of the Japanese team.

"We lost the game, but we gained confidence. Our shooting percentage didn't reach the level we needed, and we didn't have enough free throws. These are the problems we need to address," said Gobert, the three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Despite the absence of Yuta Watanabe and Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura, Gobert and the French team were not surprised by the intensity of the Japanese team in the first half. "They are a team with many shooters and fast players," Gobert said.

"The first quarter was a bit tough, but later we were able to bounce back, become more physically fit, and dominate the game." In the next match, France will have further warm-up games against Australia, a contender for the World Cup medal, at the same venue in Tokyo.
