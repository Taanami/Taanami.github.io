The Rockets faced off against the Kings at home, with all their starters scoring in double figures. Dillon Brooks led the way with 26 points, followed by Jabari Smith Jr. and Fred VanVleet with 21 points each. The Rockets only faced a brief deficit in the third quarter before regaining their momentum and defeating the Kings by 18 points. Brooks, who hit two consecutive three-pointers in the fourth quarter, even blew a flying kiss to the Kings' bench. After starting the season with three straight losses, the Rockets have now won two of their three home games. Brooks' performance has also been impressive, averaging 17.8 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game, with a shooting percentage and three-point percentage both over 60%, and a career-high 1.6 steals per game.

After the game, Brooks talked about his performance, saying, "I have to thank my teammates for finding me open shots. We have a very unselfish team." He also mentioned his frequent drives to the basket in this game, saying it was a result of reading the defense and taking advantage of their tight coverage.

This is the Rockets' second consecutive win of the season and Brooks' highest scoring game so far. His consistent performance has helped the team stay composed when facing challenges at the beginning of the season. The Rockets will face the Lakers at home in their next game, and Brooks hopes to continue his strong play and help the team secure another victory.
