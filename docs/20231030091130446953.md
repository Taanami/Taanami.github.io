Photo/Basketball Notes

The timeless classic GELHOOP series from ASICS has now reached V15. Among the many ASICS series, basketball enthusiasts who appreciate lightweight shoes with a bit of bounce and cushioning should not miss out on this pair.

In terms of appearance, ASICS has always kept changes to a minimum, maintaining the classic look of the series while making slight adjustments to the details. The biggest change in this version is the sleeker design of the heel and collar, with the addition of the "GELHOOP" logo. After testing, the editor felt that the cushioning of the GELHOOP V15 was more responsive compared to its counterpart, the GELBURST 27. The FLYTEFOAM midsole provides both cushioning and lightweight features, while the GEL in the heel provides a soft landing. Whether cutting or jumping, one can feel the feedback from the forefoot and heel without sacrificing a close-to-ground feel. The coverage has also been greatly upgraded, with the thickly padded tongue being the first feature the editor noticed when trying them on. The new lace hole design helps the shoe fit perfectly to different foot shapes, achieving a "one with the shoe" sensation. Breathability is also a strong point of ASICS shoes, and the V15 uses a PU mesh synthetic upper that provides both coverage and breathability. The midfoot's open window-style extended anti-torsion plate not only increases stability, but also helps the feet breathe 360 degrees.

The outsole is a major upgrade in this version, using NC RUBBER rubber. The straight + horizontal tread pattern in the forefoot provides increased traction when making quick stops and changes of direction. The upward curve in the forefoot is a trend in modern basketball shoe design, helping to provide a better rolling sensation when cutting and running, making it suitable for basketball players who cover a long distance on the court. The official positioning of the GELHOOP is a "lightweight and flexible" shoe, giving off a sense of stability and streamlined athleticism in both appearance and performance. In addition to being lightweight, it also provides cushioning and coverage for the feet. Basketball players who enjoy this type of shoe should definitely give it a try!
