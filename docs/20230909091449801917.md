 Introduction to the Longyao Cup International Team - The Skills Factory (TSF) in Atlanta, USA

The United States, with its prominent position in the basketball world, is not only known for the NBA but also serves as a model for other countries in various aspects such as sports events, team systems, athlete development, sports marketing, and industry growth. Among these, "preparatory schools" play an indispensable role.

Among the international college invitations announced for this year's Longyao Cup, The Skills Factory (TSF) from Atlanta, USA, is the most anticipated team. Founded in 2011, TSF is located in Atlanta, Georgia, and aims to train and develop athletes by providing age-specific, graded, and systematic skills training, personal physical development programs, and self-organized competitions. NBA stars such as James Harden, Trae Young, Kemba Walker, John Wall, Joe Johnson, Malik Beasley, etc., have all visited the school during the offseason to adjust and prepare themselves.

TSF offers five levels of training programs: Introductory Level, Foundational Level, Advanced Level, Performance Level, and Professional Level. These programs are tailored to the age, skill level, goals, and needs of the students. TSF believes that this approach can effectively develop the unique potential of each player, and in terms of performance level, they have successfully helped over 200 students enter high schools and universities in the United States, with more than 100 of them reaching the NCAA Division I level. Recent examples include Isaiah Collier (USC), ranked "Georgia Mr. Basketball 2023," Cam Kraft (Xavier), the 10th-ranked high school freshman in the U.S., Aguek Arop (SDSU), the "Rookie of the Year" from San Diego, the first Taiwanese player to receive a full scholarship in Division I, Che Yu-Cheng (USF), Filipino rookie Kai Sotto, and Ma Jianhao (GSU), a graduate of Songshan High School. TSF has become a prominent platform and preparatory school for young basketball players from around the world who aspire to pursue their dreams in the United States.

In addition to organizing their own tournaments as part of their regular training programs, TSF has been arranging overseas trips to various countries since 2017. This year, they are visiting Taiwan for the first time and are excited about the unique experience and exchange it will bring to their players. Although the specific teams and players coming to Taiwan for the Longyao Cup have not been confirmed yet, TSF's participation in the tournament is expected to generate significant attention and excitement in Taiwanese high school basketball.
