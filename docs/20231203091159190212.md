  Iron War Report G1: A Valuable Lesson from a Painful Defeat

Please continue reading as the first quarter of the game showed a decent level of focus on both offense and defense, which was a good improvement compared to the team's previous disastrous performances. However, in the second quarter, the Warriors' quick passing and cutting constantly broke through the 3-2 zone defense.

The team tried putting Daniel on the arrow position, but he was unable to fully execute his pre-game strategy due to the frequent fouls he received. It was a shame. It was clear that the team focused more on perimeter defense in this game, but they still allowed six 3-pointers in the first half. The shifting of the defense also left the interior vulnerable, resulting in fouls or a situation where there were fewer defenders than the opponents when the ball was passed to the edge of the restricted area. Improving the team's zone defense will be an important lesson to learn from this game. 

Man-to-man defense was not bad at the beginning of the second quarter, but the Warriors' high level of experience, as well as Sintlei and Shimen's vision, constantly exposed the team's backdoor defense. The players' focus and communication on defense still need to be improved. On the offensive end, the Ironmen heavily relied on 3-pointers, but only made 9 out of 32 attempts (28.1%). The team also lacked a skilled big man like Iron Rice who could set screens and create chaos, resulting in a more predictable offense. The Warriors' aggressive defense not only drained the players' energy while running, but also nullified many of the team's tactics, such as the Iverson cut and the double drag without the ball. The team needs to be better prepared for the next game against the defending champions. Go Ironmen! Please continue reading as Qu stated in the press conference that the Bank of Taiwan, as a three-time defending champion, has its own strengths. They play aggressively and smartly, which are things the Ironmen players need to continuously learn. As for my question about Beek's integration into the team, the coach mentioned that he still needs to improve in some areas, but hopes to progress quickly because in such a high-pressure environment, the opponents won't wait for him to catch up (so I think if Beek's performance continues to disappoint, he needs to be more cautious). Next game: 11/18 14:30 away game against the Formosa Dreamers. Outstanding players: Please continue reading as Wukong scored 21 points, 1 rebound, and 6 assists; Lin scored 13 points and grabbed 5 rebounds; Bennett scored 23 points, 12 rebounds, 1 steal, and 1 block; Liu Chengyan and Lu Zheyi made good use of their short playing time, each scoring a 3-pointer.
