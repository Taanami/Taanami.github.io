  The NBA announced that Josh Primo will receive a four-game suspension for inappropriate exposure, according to ESPN reporter Adrian Wojnarowski. Primo, a former player for the San Antonio Spurs, was cut from the team just one year after being drafted.

Sources told Wojnarowski that Primo had been repeatedly exposing himself to women. The suspension will go into effect when Primo signs with a new team. The NBA investigation found that Primo's actions were deemed inappropriate and aggressive. Primo claimed that his behavior was unintentional and the league's investigation did not find any evidence of a pattern of sexual misconduct or inappropriate behavior. Primo was selected 12th overall by the Spurs in the 2021 NBA Draft, which caused some speculation. He had a mediocre performance during his time with the Spurs, averaging 5.9 points and 2.3 rebounds in 54 games over two seasons.
