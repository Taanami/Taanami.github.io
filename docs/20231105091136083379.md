The Asian Games basketball final showdown against Mongolia was highlighted by Chinese team captain Liu Zheng's layup on September 28, 2023 at 23:14. The United Daily News special correspondent Zeng Si-ru reported live from Hangzhou.

Special correspondent Ji Xiang-ru photographed the key battle of the Hangzhou Asian Games men's basketball tournament, in which the Chinese team, although able to resist the host team's tall line-up inside the court, struggled on the outside and were bombarded with 15 three-pointers by the mainland team, ultimately succumbing to their first defeat with a score of 69:89. In order to secure the second place in the group, the Chinese team must win their final match against Mongolia. Team manager Zeng Wen-ding has issued a "must-win" order, and head coach Sang Mao-sen has also pointed out the key points. Sang Mao-sen mentioned that the opponent, China, had an absolute height advantage today. Throughout the game, the Chinese team's main focus was on protecting the inside, but they missed many defensive rebounds, allowing the host to grab offensive rebounds and convert them into outside attacks. He added, "Our biggest problem is that every player on our team was marked when creating opportunities, and the chances were not as good." Despite losing by 20 points, Sang Mao-sen still praised the Chinese team's fighting spirit, but there is still room for improvement in defensive communication and rotation. There are a total of 16 teams participating in the men's basketball tournament at the Asian Games, divided into four groups in the preliminary round. The group leaders will directly advance to the quarter-finals, while the second and third place teams will compete in cross-matches for the remaining four spots in the quarter-finals. The Chinese team will face Mongolia in their final match, and a victory will secure their second place in the group. The Chinese team does not have much knowledge about Mongolia, but they have done their homework on their previous match against China. Sang Mao-sen believes that their opponents will be active and have a positive attitude in the next match, and the Chinese team's disadvantage in height today may turn into an advantage in the next match. In order to have a chance to play their strong suit of transition attacks, the Chinese team must defend the rebounds well against Mongolia.

Mongolia also played against Hong Kong at the same time tonight, and ultimately lost 64:69, giving Hong Kong, who replaced Lebanon in the Asian Games, their first victory. Currently, they have the same record as the Chinese team, with one win and one loss.

In terms of strength, Hong Kong is unlikely to challenge the host in their final match, which means that the Chinese team, who defeated Hong Kong in their first match, has almost secured second place in the group.
