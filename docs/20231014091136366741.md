  Boosting Depth of the Squad: The Potential Benefit of Kelly Oubre Jr. for Philadelphia

At this moment, the Philadelphia 76ers' lineup for the opening game against the Milwaukee Bucks on October 26th is basically set.

Of course, things could still change. The James Harden trade may eventually happen, or there may be a player who becomes available and sparks the interest of the 76ers.

Please continue reading about Kelly Oubre Jr., the veteran wing player that Philadelphia signed this summer. Although some 76ers fans may have doubts or complaints about this signing, adding Oubre Jr. with a veteran minimum contract could greatly benefit the team's wing rotation. In fact, the 76ers' roster is already stacked with talented players, including MVP Joel Embiid and one of the most charismatic young stars in the NBA, Tyrese Maxey.

De'Anthony Melton has returned after an impressive first season with the 76ers, Paul Reed has a new contract and has a chance to play a new role under Nick Nurse.

But there are still plenty of question marks on this roster. Tobias Harris and P.J. Tucker are the starting power forwards for next season, and it's up to you to decide who is the small forward or power forward. Behind them, the bench wings include Oubre Jr., Danuel House Jr., Furkan Korkmaz, and Danny Green, making for a highly competitive team. Please continue reading. However, among this group of players, Oubre is clearly the most talented and has a more impressive NBA career in terms of age and experience.

Let's start with his biggest weakness - efficiency. Throughout his NBA career, his true shooting percentage has fluctuated greatly. If we are looking for a reason to be optimistic, it may be that his true shooting percentage has improved every year, reaching 53.4% last season. At the same time, his turnover rate is a bit high for a player like him, averaging more turnovers (1.1) than assists (1.0) per game throughout his career. In other words, if Oubre gets the ball, there is a good chance it will end up away from him. This is not necessarily the worst thing, as he can make up for the hesitation of players like Harris or Tucker when taking open shots.

Having a scoring player off the bench who can create his own opportunities to replace Embiid or Maxey should be a good thing.

As a highly anticipated lottery pick, Oubre's performance in the NBA has not lived up to expectations. However, his potential is still something to look forward to. Standing at 198cm with an impressive wingspan of 220cm, combined with his athleticism, he is still an attractive wing player.

In addition, he has defensive potential, but his effort can be inconsistent. And it should be noted that Oubre is only 27 years old and just had a season where he averaged more than 20 points per game. The best he can get is a veteran minimum contract with the 76ers, which is obviously a crossroads in his career. He is now on a path that we have seen many players take. When you have the ability but can't find a place on a championship-contending team, the best bet is to prove yourself and hope for a bigger contract in the future. Bobby Portis is probably the most successful example of this strategy. Portis was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the 2015 draft and has obvious talent. Although Portis has had some success, he was not a highly sought-after player while playing for the Washington Wizards and New York Knicks, so it was a bit surprising when he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2020.

However, Portis was a key player off the bench for the Bucks and became one of the heroes of their championship run that season.

Portis ultimately signed a 4-year, $48.5 million contract with the Bucks, which is a great turnaround story and proves that this kind of comeback from the bottom is not unprecedented.

Oubre and his agent, Torrel Harris, also understand that the 76ers will have enough salary cap space next season and will have Oubre's Bird rights, giving them a great chance to re-sign him.

In conclusion, it is a wise move for the 76ers to sign talented players like Oubre to a veteran minimum contract a few weeks before training camp starts. There is almost no downside to this move from a basketball perspective, unlike the situation with James Harden, which is currently a disaster and affecting every decision the 76ers make.
