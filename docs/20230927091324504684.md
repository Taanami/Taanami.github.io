 Is it reasonable for gender pay equality in the world of sports? According to The Washington Post, the female members of the Western Springs Association Football Club in New Zealand recently reached an agreement with management to increase their salaries and resources to be on par with their male counterparts. The ninth FIFA Women's World Cup, co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia, is also set to kick off in New Zealand on July 20.

Pip Meo, a former member of the New Zealand national team and advocate for gender pay equality, emphasized that the fight for equal pay is not just about salaries but also about the value of women's sports and sending a positive message to young girls who aspire to play football.

Meo added, "We cannot celebrate yet because we have to see how this deal plays out. We have only gotten what we deserve."

The Washington Post reported that while New Zealand's global image has been improving, its football industry has long struggled with unequal pay and resource distribution between men and women. Most football clubs in New Zealand are amateur clubs run by volunteers, and the maximum salary players can receive is around $94 per week, as regulated by the national soccer federation.

However, the equal distribution of wages among clubs has not been a government priority. In the New Zealand football scene, women receive lower salaries, fewer training opportunities, and less access to facilities and coaching staff compared to men. Women's teams usually have only one coach, while men's teams have several.

In 2022, members of the Manukau United football team in New Zealand initiated a campaign for equal pay and resources for men and women but ultimately failed. Maia Jackman, a team member, stated, "Many women on different teams would speak up for themselves but would then face setbacks and give up. However, the people at Western Springs are different; they have consistently stood their ground and never backed down."

In 2023, Meo and Jackman joined the predominantly male board of directors at the Western Springs Association in another attempt to achieve gender equality in football. After two months of negotiations, a 12-hour marathon mediation session, and the threat of a strike, they reached an agreement with club management to achieve gender equality.

The club subsequently issued a statement acknowledging past shortcomings and apologizing for them. Regarding the successful negotiation, Meo responded that the new agreement has not yet been officially implemented, so they cannot celebrate too early. Jackman stated, "Ultimately, we just want to play football without any limitations or concerns." She added that her focus will now be on the World Cup, hoping to showcase the charm of women's football through the tournament.

According to reports from CBS and Lexology, gender pay inequality exists in many sports worldwide. For example, in basketball, the average annual income of male NBA players in the US is $5.3 million, with star players earning significantly more. For instance, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant had annual salaries of $45.7 million and $42 million respectively last year.

In contrast, the average annual income of WNBA players in the US is only $130,000, and the highest-earning player in the league makes $230,000 per year.

However, the reports also point out that the main reason for the wage gap between men and women in sports is the lower popularity and resulting lower revenue and ticket sales of women's sports. The NBA generated approximately $10 billion in revenue last season, while the WNBA only generated $60 million.

In the case of American football, the US women's national team has generated more revenue and attracted more viewers than the men's team since 2019. However, until last year, their income and winning bonuses were still lower than those of male players. Lexology suggests that the most effective way to promote gender equality in sports is to increase the promotion of women's sports. This includes encouraging media advertising of female athletes and encouraging companies to invest in women's sports and athletes through commercial partnerships and sponsorships. This would garner more attention for female athletes, increase ticket sales, and contribute to achieving gender pay equality.
