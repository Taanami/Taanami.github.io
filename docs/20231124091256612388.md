Intae Hwang: From South Korea to the NBA Referee Team

According to official information released by the NBA, the upcoming season will see two new referees, Intae Hwang and Sha’Rae Mitchell, join the NBA officiating team. However, Hwang has attracted more attention as he will become the first non-North American NBA full-time referee.

Hwang, a native of South Korea, has 15 years of experience as a FIBA referee. He has officiated at the 2016 Rio Olympics and the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Hwang made the decision to pursue his dream in the United States. He was not alone in this journey, as he brought his entire family with him to New Jersey, where they lived while he underwent specialized training to become an NBA referee. The training lasted for 18 months, during which Hwang also had to officiate at amateur league games, although he was paid for this.

After completing the 18-month training program, Hwang started officiating G League games. Last year, he officiated in a total of 61 games and was selected as one of the eight NBA officials in reserve, with the opportunity to be called up to officiate NBA games. Now, he has officially become a full-time NBA referee.

Becoming an NBA referee took Hwang three and a half years, but it is a dream come true for him. He stated that this has been his dream and goal, to become the best referee in his profession and be chosen by the NBA. He is excited and honored to have this opportunity.

In the official announcement by the NBA, it was mentioned that the addition of Hwang and Mitchell will bring more diversity to the league and make them important members of the NBA officiating team. This also demonstrates the NBA's emphasis on diversity and inclusivity, providing referees from different countries the chance to develop their careers at the highest level of basketball in the world.
