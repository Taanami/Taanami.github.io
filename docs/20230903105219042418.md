# I just need one chance 
 I just need one chance. How Emoni Bates fell from being the top high school player in America.

For those who follow the NBA draft, the term "KD 2.0" is not unfamiliar. Every draft, any player who is over 6 feet 9 inches tall, with long arms, a slim build, smooth shooting form, and the ability to dribble and drive to the basket, is often given this nickname. Everyone hopes for the next Kevin Durant - someone who has the height of a power forward but can play like a small forward, with precise shooting like a guard. These rare qualities make Kevin Durant a lethal offensive weapon, and many teams are eager to find a player with similar talent.

Unlike many players who are given the "KD 2.0" label in college, Emoni Bates had already been highly anticipated since the age of 15. "I was ranked as the number one player in the country since sixth grade, all the way until high school graduation."

In his sophomore year, Bates received the Gatorade National Basketball Player of the Year award, becoming the youngest recipient of this honor. It's worth noting that Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Jayson Tatum, all well-known players, have also won this award in the past. This shows how promising Bates' basketball career started.

In fact, even from a young age, Bates had a height of over 6 feet 8 inches and began professional basketball training with his father at the age of 3. This solid foundation allowed Bates to possess excellent skills rather than relying solely on his height. He developed outstanding ball-handling abilities and could quickly maneuver past defenders before they could double-team him. What's even more impressive is his smooth shooting coordination, which is not limited by his height and wingspan. This makes him a versatile player who can shoot from long range and drive to the basket. These qualities are evident in his statistics, averaging 28.7 points and 10.2 rebounds per game in his freshman year, and even scoring an incredible 43 points in a game against Bronny James, son of LeBron James.

Such performances led the media to consider him the strongest high school player since LeBron James, and his tall shooting guard style was hailed as the next KD.

One would expect that such talent would attract many college scholarship offers. However, many well-known teams were conservative in their approach because Bates was simply too exceptional.

There were rumors at the time that the NBA might remove the age restriction for the 2022 season, which meant that Bates, graduating from high school, had a high chance of directly challenging the NBA. If scholarships were offered to Bates, he might not even choose to attend college. As a result, Bates decided to skip his senior year of high school and join the University of Memphis, with the plan to play one year in the NCAA before entering the NBA draft. "Being 6 feet 9 inches tall and able to dribble doesn't mean you're the next Penny Hardaway," said an ESPN commentator, summarizing Bates' freshman season.

Previously, Penny Hardaway was a tall point guard, so after witnessing Bates' potential, he actively tried to develop him into a point guard. However, Bates did not have the same level of court vision and passing skills as a true point guard. The play style of finding open teammates limited his natural scoring ability, and the experiment of playing as a point guard did not yield satisfactory results.

Jumping straight to college, the 17-year-old Bates had to face many college players who were physically stronger and more competitive than him. This added pressure to his already slim physique and affected his offensive performance.

This, in turn, affected the coach's decision to play him. He went from being a starter in every high school game to averaging around 23 minutes of playing time per game in his freshman year. Furthermore, Bates was also hampered by a back injury, which caused his playing time to be inconsistent throughout the season. He only played 18 games, recording an average of 9.7 points and 3.3 rebounds.

Unlike his dominating high school years, Memphis University actually showed more stable performance when Bates was absent. This further complicated Bates' role and led him to transfer after his freshman year.

Media outlets that once hailed Bates as the top high school player in America, with the potential to become the number one pick in the NBA draft, have now downgraded their expectations, placing him in the later stages of the first round. Just as the transfer and the struggle to adapt were ongoing, another social incident occurred, further labeling Bates as "controversial."

"I take responsibility for my mistakes. I hope everyone will forgive me as I grow. I know this won't be my last mistake, but it will be a stain on my life. It has taught me the consequences of my immaturity."
