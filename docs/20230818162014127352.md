 The Key Choice Between Stability and Aggressiveness in the Rockets' Rebuilding Path

From hiring the competitive head coach Ime Udoka, to rumors of trading for an immediate impact player with the fourth pick in the draft, to signing competitive starting players like Fred VanVleet and Dillon Brooks in free agency, all these moves indicate that the Rockets are tired of losing and determined to end their three-year period of darkness and chaos. Now, the Rockets are facing a crucial decision that will significantly impact their future - whether to choose stability or aggressiveness.

To transition from a rebuilding phase to a competitive team, it is crucial for the Rockets to establish a stable offensive system. Given the chaos the Rockets have experienced in the past four years, it is well-known how Alperen Sengun has been wasted under Stephen Silas. With the appointment of Ime Udoka, the former Celtics head coach who led the team to the NBA Finals, Sengun finally has the opportunity to shine. As a former Celtics coach, Udoka understands the importance of having a center with high-level playmaking abilities on the court. In the previous season, Udoka deliberately utilized Al Horford as a connector at the top of the key, using simple Chicago action plays to create different patterns. He also implemented tactics like Stagger screen and Ram screen to maximize Horford's abilities and value.

Playing under Udoka, who values discipline, even star scoring wings like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown do not have the authority to disregard the team's offensive system. This means that Kevin Porter Jr's ball-dominant and uncontrolled habits would be significantly masked. Whether it is playing time or role positioning, Sengun has the opportunity to regain his deserved share. However, things seem to have changed after the July summer league.

As the 2021 draft's third overall pick, Jabari Smith Jr (JSJ) has always been expected to become the best companion for Jalen Green. However, his monotonous offensive value as a rookie was not enough to shoulder the responsibilities of a second-in-command. Nevertheless, in the July summer league, JSJ showcased a new side to Rockets fans. Unlike his usual role as a perimeter receiver in the regular season, Jabari Smith Jr took on more ball-handling responsibilities in the summer league, scoring 33 points with 7 rebounds and 38 points with 7 rebounds and 6 assists in two games. His shooting percentages of 48.8/33.3/85.2 were much more efficient than in the regular season. Building on his scoring threat, JSJ even demonstrated his ability to initiate high-level attacks, showcasing his playmaking value as a forward. This has made Sengun's future development more uncertain.

The example of Al Horford mentioned earlier actually leaves room for discussion. Since developing his three-point shooting with the Atlanta Hawks in 2015, Horford maintained a level of shooting performance over the following seven seasons. Even though Horford's three-point shooting percentage was a personal low in Udoka's season coaching the Celtics, averaging 3.8 three-point attempts per game with a 33.6% overall three-point shooting percentage and a 35.6% catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage is still useful for a center. Horford's value as a perimeter shooter is the key to his versatile role, whether it be pick-and-pop, pop-out after off-screen actions, or spot-up catch-and-shoot opportunities. However, Alperen Sengun only attempted 0.8 three-pointers per game last season with a 33.3% shooting percentage. Although his abilities are limited at this stage, his potential in shooting cannot be ignored. On the other hand, Jabari Smith Jr's shooting prospects are much brighter compared to Sengun's. Stability will be an issue for JSJ to address in the future, but his college career has already shown a high shooting ceiling, and he may even become a better shooter than Horford, able to shoot without being disturbed. This will truly replicate Horford's on-court value.

From this, it is evident that the Rockets' biggest challenge at this stage is which offensive system to establish, especially considering the future core of Jalen Green, Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, and Cam Whitmore.

Option One: Reuse Alperen Sengun and replicate the Grizzlies' model of relying on Steven Adams' high-level impact to maintain offensive stability. This not only gives Sengun the potential to have a similar offensive impact as All-Star Domantas Sabonis in the future but also covers the inconsistent offense of players like Jalen Green, Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, and Cam Whitmore, concealing their flaws. Similar to how Steven Adams clears the way for Ja Morant and Desmond Bane, this option can provide insurance for the majority of the Rockets' players who are still in the process of realizing their talent.
