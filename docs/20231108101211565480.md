 Recently, Jimmy Butler's long hair style has caused quite a stir in the NBA world. Fans have even given it a name.

In another video, Adebayo can be heard saying that Butler's lip ring is annoying, to which Butler responds that he has to maintain his character. Adebayo then jokes, "Sh*t, you really went to get this haircut for media day." Butler responds, "It's my Halloween costume." 

During a press conference, Adebayo was asked about his thoughts on Butler's new hairdo, to which he replied, "I think he's misunderstood. We all have moments where we get caught up in our emotions."
