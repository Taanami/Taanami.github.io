Ben Simmons, who has been plagued by back injuries in the past few years, also played and scored 10 points in 14 minutes with 3 assists. After the game, he also gave an interview about his current condition.

"It feels great, really great. I'm glad to be able to play and compete against the opposing team. I feel really good right now, this is definitely the best I've felt in my body in the past two years, for sure," Simmons said. Nets head coach Jacque Vaughn also commented on Simmons' performance: "He attacked the basket all night. I think he controlled the game pace very naturally on the court and communicated well with his teammates about the game. I'm very happy to see these things he showed." In addition to the post-game interview, Simmons also said, "I'm excited, very excited. Being able to come here and play and put on a high-intensity game, I'm very grateful for that. I'm back playing in the NBA, it's so exciting, it's a great job." "I know it's been a while since I've played, but I've been working hard to get myself in this condition. So I know I'm ready to play and help the team win," Simmons said.
