  Lin Bing-Sheng speaks out on Taishin's criticism of the dispute over the contract with the Lion City Warriors and says that legal procedures have been taken.

 "Lin Bing-Sheng" has been one of the hottest terms in Taiwanese basketball from August to now. First, he was added to the Chinese Blue Team in the Jones Cup, and then he was officially announced to join the P. LEAGUE+ Hsinchu Street Corner Warriors through various clues. However, Lin Bing-Sheng later posted on his social media that he had already declined the offer to join. Later, the T1 League's new team, the Taipower Taishin Warriors, released a statement confirming that Taishin was the team that signed with Lin Bing-Sheng. They also pointed out that Taishin did indeed sign with Lin Bing-Sheng after he had terminated his contract with his former team, the New Taipei CTBC Attack, and became a free agent, which is a legitimate move. However, the Lion City Warriors have been insisting on their stance through press conferences and the mediation meeting held by the Chinese Basketball Association. Last week, they even announced that they had filed a civil lawsuit against Lin Bing-Sheng for his absence from the mediation meeting without a valid reason and demanded compensation for the loss of the team.

Lin Bing-Sheng followed his script and expressed his gratitude to the fans and media for their concern about his recent contract disputes. He also offered his sincerest apologies to the Lion City Warriors team. However, he also wanted to explain the whole story. He had negotiations with the high-level members of the Lion City Warriors, Zhang Yun-Zhi and current general manager Zhang Shu-Ren, at the end of May. They knew that his contract with his former team was not yet expired, but they signed a commission contract on May 28th, which would take effect on September 1st. However, Lin Bing-Sheng thought that he should first present his written offer to his former team and see if they would match it, but the Lion City Warriors said it was not necessary.

 Later, during the mediation meeting held by the Chinese Basketball Association, Lin Bing-Sheng showed the conversation records and pointed out that he had informed them that his appointed lawyer would attend and he did not absent himself without a valid reason.

 Even after signing the commission contract with the Lion City Warriors, other teams still contacted Lin Bing-Sheng. He asked the Lion City Warriors about it, and they said they wanted to keep it confidential and low-key. However, after consulting with his lawyer, Lin Bing-Sheng found out that the commission contract signed with the Lion City Warriors was not in accordance with the proper procedures. He then contacted Taishin and signed with them. Due to this decision, Lin Bing-Sheng repeatedly told the Lion City Warriors that he had no intention of joining them. On August 14th, he met Zhang Shu-Ren, who would later become the general manager of the Lion City Warriors, and Zhang told him that they would not announce Lin Bing-Sheng's joining. However, on August 15th, the Lion City Warriors' official social media still announced that Lin Bing-Sheng had joined the team. Lin Bing-Sheng said that he had already terminated the commission contract with the Lion City Warriors and only signed with Taishin after obtaining the departure certificate from the CTBC Attack. This is also what Taishin claims, that they signed with Lin Bing-Sheng after the CTBC Attack terminated his contract, and that is why Taishin and Lin Bing-Sheng signed after he became a free agent. According to the Taipower Taishin Warriors, their claim is that there was no problem with the transition between the contracts of Lin Bing-Sheng and the CTBC Attack. However, people are curious as to why the CTBC Attack would use their team's option in a way that would not benefit them. It was only after the CTBC Attack terminated his contract that Taishin signed with Lin Bing-Sheng. The current problem is that if what Lin Bing-Sheng says is true, and the timeline presented by Taishin today is accurate, then did the Lion City Warriors indeed contact Lin Bing-Sheng in May and sign a contract with him, regardless of the type of contract, employment or commission, and whether or not they had set a specific time? Did they really have the intention to contact a free agent and even poach him? Please continue reading below. Lin Bing-Sheng's appointed lawyer, Liao Wei-Zhi, also pointed out that Taishin's procedure was to first offer Lin Bing-Sheng a contract, then the CTBC Attack confirmed that they would not pursue him, and were willing to terminate the contract early, and only after that did Taishin sign with Lin Bing-Sheng.

 In fact, Taishin's statement today was no surprise, as they focused on the timeline of their contract with Lin Bing-Sheng compared to the CTBC Attack's contract. They can certainly hold their ground in court, even if they end up in court. However, the biggest problem in this contract dispute is that regardless of whether Lin Bing-Sheng believes that the commission contract with the Lion City Warriors is invalid, he did sign with another team after he had already signed the commission contract with them. It can be seen from the fact that he had to inform the Lion City Warriors afterwards that he had no intention of joining them. Even if it turns out that they were in the right legally, it is still not right to do so at that time. The bigger issue with this press conference is that the leader of the Taishin team came out to explain things from their perspective, but even if they were worried that Lin Bing-Sheng might accidentally reveal something or say something different from the script, the appointed lawyer should have been there to fill in the gaps or speak on his behalf. However, after Lin Bing-Sheng and the lawyer spoke, they both left without accepting any interviews from the media, leaving Shang Rui-Qiang to answer the questions. Even Shang Rui-Qiang could not explain whether Lin Bing-Sheng knew about the commission contract with the Lion City Warriors when he contacted Taishin. In the end, it all boils down to the claims of the Lion City Warriors and Taishin. (Photo credit: Taipower Taishin Warriors)
