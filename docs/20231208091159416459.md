 The HBL match between Sanmin and Youth ended with Sanmin's victory, securing their spot in the top 12. Sanmin players celebrated happily.

In the past two years, Sanmin High School failed to qualify for the HBL tournament. However, in the 112th academic year, they not only made it to the top 16 in the HBL Men's Division 1 qualifier, but also defeated the representative of Taichung, Youth High School, with a score of 77:61 on the final day of the qualifier. With the help of Yeh Jen-hao's six three-pointers, they secured a spot in the top 12 in Kaohsiung and will return for the next round next month.

The HBL Men's Division 1 tournament added Kaohsiung Arena starting from the 105th academic year. However, Sanmin High School, which is located next to the arena, has always been one step away. It wasn't until the 109th academic year that they finally made it to the top 12 and stepped onto the stage of Kaohsiung Arena for the first time in their school history. However, they failed to advance to the top 8 that year, causing them to start from the qualifier in the 110th academic year, and they failed to qualify for the past two years.

With the goal of "returning to Kaohsiung," Sanmin launched a challenge this year. In yesterday's second qualifier game, they were leading by 13 points in the fourth quarter against last year's top 8 team, San Chung Commercial and Industrial High School. However, they lost the game with a score of 90:95, missing the chance to start off with a win. In today's game against Youth, who defeated San Chung, they needed to win by at least 5 points to secure the last spot for the next round. In the first quarter, Sanmin took a 19:9 lead, but Youth fought back with a 7:0 run. The score remained tight in the second quarter, with Sanmin only leading by 34:28 at halftime. However, with Yeh Jen-hao's three-pointers in the third quarter, Sanmin had a 20:9 run and entered the final quarter with a 54:37 lead.

In the fourth quarter, Youth tried to catch up with three-pointers, but their shooting percentage did not improve. With 4 minutes and 2 seconds remaining, they were still behind by 44:61. After the last timeout called by coach Deng An-cheng, they still couldn't stop Sanmin. Sanmin's Mai You-hua added a three-pointer, and even with starting guard Lin Sheng-wei injured and leaving the game, Sanmin still managed to defeat Youth with a score of 77:61, securing their spot in the top 12. Yeh Jen-hao scored 25 points with 6 three-pointers, and Chiang Chieh-hung had a double-double with 16 points and 11 rebounds, helping the team to defeat Youth with a big lead. With only 7 three-pointers made out of 44 attempts, Youth was eliminated. Currently, 10 teams have secured their spots in the top 12, including Guangfu High School, San Chung Commercial and Industrial High School, Sanmin High School, Songshan High School, Gao Yuan Vocational and Commercial High School, Yilan High School, Nan Shan High School, Dong Tai High School, Neng Ren High School, and Tai Shan High School. The match between Jinhe High School and Chenggong High School, as well as the match between Keelung Commercial and Industrial High School and Nanhu High School, will determine the last two spots in the top 12.
