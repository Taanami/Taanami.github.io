 Impossible becomes possible - thank you Chinese men's basketball team and their 3x3 Asian Games gold medal inspiration

No one could have imagined that the Chinese men's basketball team would achieve the impossible and win a gold medal at the 3x3 Asian Games. As anyone who plays basketball knows, besides the technical aspect, basketball heavily relies on physical attributes. Given Taiwan's ranking in Asian basketball and its genetic makeup, it is difficult to be considered a top contender in high-level international competitions. Please continue reading before the championship game, the Chinese team continuously overcame obstacles and defeated national teams that were initially considered stronger than us, including defeating China in the quarterfinals and a comeback victory against South Korea in the semifinals. The Chinese team solidly defeated these teams that were deemed impossible to beat in a full-court 5-on-5 game.

Initially, the Chinese team had already done well, and that was what the author thought before the gold medal game. But the players' appearance on the court in Qatar made the difference even more apparent. The Qatari players were physically strong and muscular, and compared to them, the Chinese team appeared to be lacking in thickness. In my heart, I hoped that we wouldn't lose too embarrassingly and that a silver medal would already be good enough. The game started as expected, with the opponents quickly establishing a 5-point lead with two perimeter players and one under the basket. I thought to myself, "Well, this is the difference."

However, fueled by patriotism and my love for 3x3 basketball (which is essentially Taiwan's national sport, as it can be played anywhere), I still hoped that our team would put up a fight.

As I watched the Qatari team's accurate shooting from the outside, our team struggled to produce effective offense. I couldn't help but curse in front of the TV, "Why can't they make shots?" "What are we even defending? They're more accurate than us even without playing in the paint." Throughout the game, the Chinese team was constantly playing catch-up and fell behind. I believe all Taiwanese fans thought that winning this game would be very difficult. Please continue reading. However, as readers who watched the broadcast know, the Chinese team managed to tie the game in the final minute and, during the last few seconds of the game, a foul was called on Qatar's defense. With Qatar accumulating eight team fouls, Lin Xin-kuan made both free throws, leading to a comeback victory.

It was an incredible comeback, a basketball game that no one believed the Chinese team would win at the Asian Games. As the game progressed, the author sensed a change in the situation, observing that the Qatari team's initial accuracy declined, while the Chinese team gradually maintained a decent shooting percentage from the outside and became more daring in challenging the paint, resulting in accumulating fouls from the opponent.

Of course, throughout the game, the Chinese team became more focused and proactive in their positioning and passing, finding breakthroughs and scoring opportunities. In terms of physical stamina, Qatar seemed to have declined, while the Chinese team had to grit their teeth and persevere. In terms of mentality, the Chinese team's strong desire to turn the game around was evident due to their continuous lagging behind.

From watching the game on TV to the award ceremony, the author cheered passionately and was deeply moved.

As Coach Xu Jinzhe (who served as a commentator for the game) said, the Chinese team chose forwards (around 190 cm) who could shoot from the outside and emphasized players with that ability. Among them, eight players trained together from January to June before the Asian Games, and in the end, four players were selected as the main team. Therefore, Lin Xin-kuan, Jiang Jun, Yu Xiangping, and Wang Zheyu were the four players on the court (of course, credit should also be given to the coaching staff and the training they provided). The other four players should also be commended.

A game is like life - nothing is impossible. This game sparked intense discussions among fans online, and most importantly, it showcased our basketball abilities. We were considered the underdog, underestimated domestically and internationally, but we shattered everyone's expectations. If we were to rationally summarize the factors that led to our gold medal victory, it would include the initial selection strategy, the team's chemistry, and the players' mental focus and perseverance.

However, what touched me the most about the Chinese team's victory this time is the inspiration it brought to everyone, both on and off the court. It is something that we can never get tired of hearing: "Even if no one believes in themselves, or if they believe they have reached their limit, they should still stay true to themselves and not set limitations. As long as they step onto the court, there is an opportunity. Give it your all, and don't leave any regrets."

I believe that in the coming days, there will be more articles written about the legendary Chinese men's basketball team in this 3x3 competition. I would like to express my gratitude to the Chinese men's basketball team. Thank you for showcasing your worth through team basketball, proving Taiwan's capabilities, and bringing us a lot of positive energy.
