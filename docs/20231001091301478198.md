Porter Jr. was invited to Taiwan for a series of charitable activities, with the highlight being the opening pitch for the Chinatrust Brothers team. The game was delayed due to rain, but Porter Jr. still took the opportunity to throw the first pitch. However, before the pitch, a fan made a sudden and unexpected move. 

During an interview with the host, Porter Jr. suddenly had a white-shirted man rush onto the field, opening his arms and tightly embracing him. The host and translator quickly pushed the fan away, while Porter Jr. maintained a smile and shook hands with the fan in response. The man in the white shirt managed to escape the control of the staff members and ran around the field. Seeing this, Porter Jr. laughed and said, "Run my boy, run!" 

The fan's intrusion finally came to an end, and Porter Jr. continued the interview, expressing his happiness to be there and his excitement about throwing the first pitch. He jokingly warned the audience to be careful. Before the game, Porter Jr. also learned a few moves from the Brothers' pitching coach, hoping to show them to the fans. In the end, he put extra effort into throwing the ball, but due to the wrong angle, it landed early, bouncing into the hands of the catcher, Zhou Siqi.
