Hansen is highly praised for his passing abilities, physical condition, and leadership qualities on the court. Aside from needing to improve his three-point shooting, he has hardly any weaknesses and has a good chance of becoming a highly sought-after rookie in the league.

Hansen played in all 19 games for the G League this year, averaging 16.5 points and 6.8 assists, but his three-point shooting percentage was only 27.5%.

What's awkward is that after the Trail Blazers picked Hansen, it remains to be seen if they will once again start trade talks for their star player Damian Lillard, or have the veteran lead the team with Hansen as their backcourt duo.【Join the Key Opinion Network】Receive daily excellent articles straight to your inbox, weekly editor's picks, current affairs, and arts and culture reports, and more special e-newsletters.
