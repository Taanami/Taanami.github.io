 The NBA Spurs team won the first overall pick in the lottery and is expected to select the highly anticipated "French monster" Victor Wembanyama. If they successfully sign him, it will be the third time in the team's history to acquire a game-changing tall player.

The 14 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs this season were eligible to participate in the NBA draft lottery.

The Detroit Pistons, Houston Rockets, and San Antonio Spurs, who had the worst regular-season records, had the highest chances of winning the first overall pick. According to the current rules, each of the three teams had a 14.0% chance of winning the first overall pick. The Spurs, represented by team executive Peter J. Holt, won the first overall pick, while the second and third picks went to the Charlotte Hornets and Portland Trail Blazers respectively. The fourth pick belongs to the Rockets.

With the first overall pick, the Spurs are almost certain to select one of the most highly anticipated rookies in NBA history, 19-year-old French player Victor Wembanyama, who stands at 7 feet 3 inches (approximately 221 cm) tall. It is expected that he will immediately make an impact in the NBA.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, "He is an incredible young man, only 19 years old, but clearly a generational talent." This is the Spurs' third time winning the draft lottery. The players they selected with the first overall pick in the previous two instances have greatly contributed to the team's success.

In 1987, the Spurs selected "The Admiral" David Robinson, and in 1997, they chose "The Big Fundamental" Tim Duncan. Both players were key pillars in the team's five championship victories under current head coach Gregg Popovich.

The Spurs finished the season with a record of 22 wins and 60 losses, tied for second-to-last in the league.

Popovich has had great success working with international players in the past, such as Manu Ginobili from Argentina and Tony Parker from France. Now, he has the opportunity to build a new "Spurs dynasty" with Wembanyama. The fifth to fourteenth picks, in order, belong to the Pistons, Magic, Indiana Pacers, Washington Wizards, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks, Magic (again), Oklahoma City Thunder, Toronto Raptors, and New Orleans Pelicans.
