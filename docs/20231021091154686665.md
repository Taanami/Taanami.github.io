Will Ron Holland, who possesses absolute confidence, be the top pick in the 2024 NBA Draft?

The 2023-24 NBA season has yet to begin, but Ron Holland, the star of the G League Ignite team, has already sparked discussion about the 2024 NBA Draft.

In the G League Fall Invitational against the Perth Wildcats of the Australian NBL, Holland averaged 28.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, 4.0 steals, and 1.5 assists per game, leaving a strong impression. This 203cm tall power forward put on a firepower display, making him one of the most promising players this year.

Known for his energy, intensity, and competitiveness on the defensive end, Holland uses his sharp instincts and 210cm wingspan to wreak havoc in the mid-range and paint.

The battle for the top pick next year still remains uncertain, but Holland has already set himself up for success at a professional level, which is why he believes the G League is the right path for him.

Holland had originally committed to the University of Texas, but after head coach Chris Beard was fired due to a domestic violence case, the 18-year-old decided to reconsider his post-high school development in April. He told The Sporting News, "After I left the University of Texas, the people around me told me to keep an open mind."

"I went to visit the G League and see if everything they told me when they recruited me was true, and it turned out to be even more than I expected." Please continue reading below. Holland wants to choose the best option for his development, and since the establishment of the Ignite team in 2019-20, no plan has produced more NBA players than them. Holland also mentioned the third pick in the 2023 draft: "Regarding this matter, I have definitely talked to Scoot (Henderson) a lot, because he is the most recent player they sent to the NBA."

"When I talked to him, he mentioned that if going to the NBA is what you want to do, they can provide everything you might ask for."

"I think this is the right path. Looking at the achievements they have achieved with Jalen Green and others, how the Ignite team helped them enter the draft, I thought, 'This is what I want to do.'" "This is a professional path. What could be more suitable than professional-level basketball to teach you how to become a professional player?"

Although he repeatedly mentioned that he is working hard to develop and improve his offensive performance, he knows that defense is his unique advantage.

Please continue reading below. Holland confidently said, "The most important thing about defense is that I just hate losing. I know that if I can lock down on defense, it means that the opponent cannot score. If they cannot score, they cannot win the game. It's really just that mindset." Although many promising players like to say that they like to watch Kobe Bryant or Kevin Durant, Holland chooses to focus on some of his favorite defensive disruptors to emulate. Holland told TSN, "I studied Jrue Holiday very seriously. He is one of the best defenders in the league, and it really is how hard he works on defense, and how much he controls the opponent's offense. He knows how the opponent will attack, and he knows who should be where, so he can help his teammates lock down their positions and arrange the formation."

He also mentioned that he sees similarities between his trajectory and Phoenix Suns' rising star Mikal Bridges. Holland said, "Before Mikal Bridges became a high-level player, his job was to defend the best offensive player and take shots when he was open."

"How he closely follows the ball, and accepts his role to confirm whether the best player on the opponent's team can score, this is not easy. The level of defense he locks in is the direction I want to work towards." Holland emphasized that his versatility is his biggest advantage as a new generation player. He strives to excel in his role, just like Bridges has done on his two teams so far in his career.

Holland said, "The more versatile your abilities are, the more valuable you are. The more versatile you are, the easier the game becomes, because no matter where you are placed, the coach can trust you to do your job."

"I think I can do this in the league. No matter where I go, I can fulfill my duties. I can defend positions one through five, so it doesn't really matter. I'm ready to accept a role." Holland also mentioned that his goal is to lead the Ignite team to win the G League championship this season. At the same time, he hopes to maintain his weight between 90 and 93 kilograms to help him establish himself as a defensive player in the NBA.

Beneath his appearance and strong physique, Holland has a confident mindset and a firm belief in himself. Even when faced with challenges like the NBA Draft, he still believes that he can become the next top pick.
