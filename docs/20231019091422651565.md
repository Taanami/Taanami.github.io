Traveling Bulls are different: Five players that FIBA fans might be interested in. Marko and Vooch celebrate with a high-five (via FIBA Official Website). Representing Montenegro, Nikola Vučević and Marko Simonović were teammates on the Chicago Bulls for the past two seasons. Now, Vooch is the undisputed leader of the national team.

While Marko starts alongside Vooch, his playing time and impact on the court is not on the same level as the star player.

In the group stage of Group D, Montenegro's biggest challenge was against Lithuania, while they faced less competitive teams in Egypt and Mexico.

As predicted, Montenegro won 2 out of 3 games, only losing to Lithuania. They advanced to the second round as the second-place team in the group and faced the top two teams from Group C, USA and Greece, in hopes of advancing to the quarter-finals. In a crucial game against the USA, Montenegro led for most of the first half, but was unable to maintain their lead in the third quarter and ultimately lost by 12 points.

In their final game, they narrowly defeated Greece, finishing with a record of 3 wins and 2 losses and an overall ranking of 11th place. The loss to the USA not only prevented Montenegro from advancing to the quarter-finals, but also cost them a spot in next year's Paris Olympics. They will now have to compete in the Olympic qualifiers with 24 other countries vying for the remaining 4 spots.

However, in the third game against Lithuania, he faced his fellow NBA center, Jonas Valančiūnas from the New Orleans Pelicans.

Despite a close first quarter, Lithuania had a nearly 59% field goal percentage and a 47.1% three-point percentage for the entire game. In contrast, Montenegro's outside shooting only had a 16.1% success rate (31 attempts, 5 made). In the end, Lithuania won by 20 points.

After three games, Montenegro had a record of 2 wins and 1 loss, placing them second in the group and advancing to the next round. In their second round match against the US, a favorite to win the championship, Vooch and naturalized guard Kendrick Perry led the team with a strong offensive performance. With a rebounding advantage, they were able to lead by 1 point at halftime. However, the US team bounced back in the second half, with young guard Tyrese Haliburton controlling the pace of the game and securing a double-digit lead for the US.

Although they lost, Vooch's impressive performance of 18 points, 16 rebounds, and 2 blocks made the US team sweat. 

After the loss to the US, Montenegro was eliminated from the quarter-finals. In their final game against Greece, Vooch continued to dominate, scoring crucial points in the fourth quarter to secure the win. Overall, without Vooch's strong presence in the paint, Montenegro may have only won 1 or 2 games in the tournament. His importance to the national team cannot be overstated.
