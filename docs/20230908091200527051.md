  The curtain falls on Leonard's career in the Holy City

As negotiations for Kawhi Leonard's next team, such as the Celtics, Lakers, and 76ers, cooled down a month ago, the Spurs gradually lost their bargaining power.

Similar to how the Thunder surprised everyone last year by acquiring Paul George, this time it was an unexpected destination that ended this heated drama. Please continue reading as the Raptors, at great cost, found their claw (The KLAW), and the Spurs received an offer they couldn't refuse, exchanging a top five player in the league for a strong reinforcement who was selected to the All-NBA Second Team this season. Please continue reading as we explore this accurately calculated risk. 

Since being swept by the Cavaliers this year, head coach Dwane Casey was sadly fired, and many experts believe that the Raptors, who have been dominating the Eastern Conference, have reached their limit in terms of building a championship team. Despite LeBron James' journey to the West, the rise of the 76ers and Celtics, and the presence of the Bucks and Pacers led by Antetokounmpo and Oladipo, the Raptors are facing tough competition.

In comparison, the Raptors, whose core players are entering their prime, not only lack future prospects compared to other competitive teams, but also locked in their future by re-signing Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka last year.

For Raptors' General Manager Masai Ujiri, there is no better opportunity for a major breakthrough than acquiring Kawhi Leonard, a top five player in the league just one year ago, a two-time MVP, and a former Defensive Player of the Year.

If Kyle Lowry's enthusiasm and the $50 million difference can successfully convince Leonard to re-sign next summer, his age and dominant offensive and defensive abilities will definitely allow the Raptors to compete with the powerhouses in the Eastern Conference. If Leonard remains determined to leave, along with Danny Green's expiring contract, the Raptors can clear up $30 million in salary space and trade players like Lowry and Ibaka to teams with significant cap space but lack reinforcements, thus entering a rebuilding phase ahead of schedule.

Similar to the Thunder's trade for Paul George with Victor Oladipo as the main piece last year, although this trade carries a gambling element and involves two years of uncertainty, it is also reasonable.

Let's not forget how Kawhi Leonard single-handedly led the Spurs to the Western Conference Finals just a year ago. Some may worry that Leonard will replicate Vince Carter's trade-seeking mode of not giving his best effort, but I believe this is an unnecessary concern.

With a wealth of talent available in next year's free agency, if Leonard fails to perform as expected upon his return and his future remains uncertain in terms of his abilities or health, there are frontline players such as Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, and Kemba Walker lining up. The two Los Angeles teams are not the only options for him.

As for the speculation of boycotting or not reporting to Toronto, it is purely a fantasy. Despite expressing his reluctance to play in Toronto, under the restrictions of the collective bargaining agreement, if Leonard fails to report to the Raptors within a week, he will be heavily penalized by the team and the league for "harming the league's development." Unless Leonard is prepared to pay a hefty fine or even face the worst-case scenario of being expelled from the league, going against a $8 billion organization is an overstatement.

Going back to the trade itself, as the cost of upgrading, the Raptors only gave up Jakob Poeltl, a center who would have been blocked by Jonas Valanciunas in the future for two more years, and a well-protected first-round pick, while strictly refusing to include OG Anunoby. Ujiri did not jeopardize his status as the "Executive of the Year" with this trade, as his risk management was precise. They received an instant impact player in return when Tony Parker's return from injury did not meet expectations, promptly promoting Dejounte Murray. When their perimeter shooting struggled this season, they immediately brought back the highly compatible old comrade Marco Belinelli.

For Aldridge, who is nearing the end of his career, and Popovich, who could retire at any time, capturing the peak performance of these two core players is the most important task for the Spurs. This trade is no exception! Compared to the likes of Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Dario Saric, Robert Covington, and other highly touted young players, DeMar DeRozan is undoubtedly the most immediately impactful option. Even if the Lakers or 76ers were willing to offer them, it wouldn't be easy for them to reach the heights DeRozan has achieved in the next two years. To some extent, the Raptors were lucky to have DeMar DeRozan on the trade table, and the Spurs were fortunate. The most obvious comparison is the 2011 trade involving Carmelo Anthony, where the Nuggets sent Anthony, who only wanted to go to the Knicks, along with Chauncey Billups, and received Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, and Timofey Mozgov, as well as an unprotected first-round pick. The trade was later mocked as the "Girls' Generation" for the Nuggets, who saw a 12-win drop the following year.

It wasn't until they acquired Andre Iguodala through a trade that the team rebounded from this low point.

The talents of Chandler and Gallinari, which were rumored at the time, were no less than Ingram and Kuzma today. However, the reality proved that basketball is not just about individual skills; it is a league where "finding one true star is more difficult than having a thousand soldiers."
