Tomorrow at 20:40, the United States will face Italy in the quarterfinals of the World Cup. Paolo Banchero, who represents the US team in this tournament, holds dual citizenship of Italy and the United States.

Although there is no problem with Banchero's decision to play for the United States, the Italian men's basketball team is quite dissatisfied with it. This article will take you through the whole story.

1. Banchero expressed his desire to play for Italy. On October 31, 2022, Paolo Banchero talked about the process of obtaining Italian citizenship in an interview on the show "Young Person." He expressed his gratitude to Italy for the love the country has given him, and most importantly, Banchero himself stated that he plans to play for the Italian national team.

Banchero also explained his Italian heritage in great detail on the show. RJ Hampton, who was also present during the interview, talked about his experience in the US basketball youth team. Banchero mentioned that he participated in the selection for the US U17 team when he was 15 years old, but ultimately did not make the cut. In a subsequent interview with "Milan Sports News," Banchero reiterated his desire to play for Italy in the World Cup.

Banchero was proud of Italy's victory over Serbia, led by Nikola Jokic, in the EuroBasket.

According to reports at the time, Italian national team head coach Gianmarco Pozzecco, Italian national team general manager Salvatore Trainotti, and Italian Basketball Federation president Gianni Petrucci planned to fly to the United States to meet with Banchero and discuss the possibility of him joining the national team for the 2023 Basketball World Cup.

2. Things didn't go as planned, Banchero switched to the United States. On June 24 of this year, Shams Charania reported that Banchero would play for the United States in the World Cup. Regarding his decision to represent the United States, Banchero said, "This photo is of my mother representing the United States. In the 1990s, she was a member of the US women's basketball team." Banchero's experience working with former US team coach and NCAA legend "Coach K," Mike Krzyzewski, at Duke University also played an important role in his decision.

Coach K once asked him if he intended to play for Italy, and when Banchero answered yes, Coach K asked him to reconsider and recalled Kyrie Irving's experience in choosing between Australia and the United States. On the Italian side, although Banchero had expressed his desire to play for Italy, as the World Cup approached this summer, Italy became less optimistic about Banchero's chances of representing Italy. After Banchero made this decision, he faced strong criticism from the Italian Basketball Federation, accusing him of "betrayal."

Gianni Petrucci, president of the Italian Basketball Federation, was very angry about this.

3. A confrontation is imminent. During yesterday's training, Banchero was interviewed by European media and was asked if he had anything to say to Italian fans. He replied without hesitation, "No." Banchero stated that he would treat the game against Italy "like any other game." Tonight at 20:40, the United States will officially face Italy. Will Italy defeat the United States and advance, or will the United States win convincingly? Let's look forward to the game tonight!
