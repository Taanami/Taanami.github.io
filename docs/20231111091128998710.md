  202324 Season Analysis: Tainan Taiwan Steel Eagles Return to Triple Towers Lineup, Can They Make it to the Finals Again?

Last season, the Eagles were the most improved team in the league. They went from a record of 6 wins and 24 losses in their first season to making it to the finals. Although they were swept by the special attack team, it was still a very successful season for the Eagles. But after a summer break, can this Triple Towers lineup lead the team back to the finals or even win the championship? Last season, the three towers combined for an average of 61.4 points and 36.1 rebounds per game. Among them, A-Shiva was the most important, with an average of 61.4 points and 36.1 rebounds per game. Singh Bhullar and Samuel Deguara also had impressive field goal percentages of 69% and 70% respectively.

In addition, A-Shiva (Robert Upshaw III) is the core of the team, having played 25 games last season and averaging 21.8 points, 12 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game. Most importantly, he attempted an average of 5.6 three-point shots per game with a 35% success rate. While this may not be a high percentage, it is rare to see a 213cm tall center provide such firepower both inside and outside the paint. This makes him the most indispensable tower in the Triple Towers lineup.

However, from the two official warm-up games and the league's opening game, it seems that the Eagles' proud "Triple Towers" lineup is no longer the same. Please continue reading for the source of the photos/Tainan Taiwan Steel Eagles official fan page. Is the "Triple Towers" lineup cracking? A-Shiva scored 0 points and 8 rebounds in the opening game. However, after a summer break, A-Shiva not only suffered an injury in an NBL game and made a statement on IG that he ended his remaining NBL season due to his teammate Deguara playing too dirty, but also there seems to be an irreparable rift in this "Triple Towers" lineup. Although A-Shiva's injury had healed before the official warm-up game, he did not play in the game. Coach Liu Mengzhu's explanation was that he wanted A-Shiva to be healthy and well-prepared for the opening game. However, A-Shiva's performance in the opening game was disappointing. Apart from a noticeable decline in his physical condition, he only played for 12 minutes and missed both of his shots, resulting in a poor stat line of 0 points and 8 rebounds. If A-Shiva cannot quickly regain his physical and game feel, it will undoubtedly have a huge impact on the entire team.

Although he had a good performance of 14 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 blocks in the warm-up game with a field goal percentage of 66.7%, there were still visible signs of physical decline. Among the three players, only Deguara seems to have maintained or even slightly improved. He scored 45 points against the War Gods in the warm-up game and almost recorded a double-double of 22 points and 19 rebounds against the special attack team in the opening game. However, as the game went on, it was apparent that Deguara's physical strength was not enough to dominate the game. Moreover, it is evident that the team or Deguara himself hopes to at least improve his mobility, so he had to use more energy to run in this game. As a result, the Eagles once again lost to the special attack team. The Eagles' problems remain, with no outside shooting and no playmaking. In fact, from this opening game, it is evident that the Eagles have not solved the problems from last season. Although they have acquired several players, including Su Yijin, who are descendants of the Suns, and also signed a foreign player, Kim Kin, who has a good scoring ability, they still lack a stable outside shooter and a playmaking guard. The team's three-point shooting percentage was only 34.4% and they had 15 assists with 24 turnovers, indicating that the Eagles will have an even worse record than last season if they continue like this. Moreover, this three-point shooting percentage was achieved with Kin making 5 of 8 three-pointers, but his three-point percentage was less than 30% last season. So it is almost impossible to expect him to maintain this shooting percentage in future games. Source of photos/T1 League It will be challenging to rely on Kin alone to change the team's style of play. Coach Liu Mengzhu once mentioned in an interview that after Kin joined the team, the Triple Towers lineup might not be seen as frequently because he hopes to improve the team's speed on both offense and defense. This is a good idea and direction, as well as the only area where the Eagles can improve on their weaknesses from last season. In the opening game, it was evident that the Eagles wanted to push the pace after grabbing a defensive rebound, but this resulted in consecutive turnovers. In the second half, the team could still be seen trying to feed the ball into the paint, but as Deguara's physical strength declined, this tactic resulted in more turnovers. The congested paint also made it difficult for the forwards to make backdoor cuts. The lack of a plan for outside shooting and a finishing point also led to turnovers even when trying to make passes at the top of the arc. Please continue reading.
