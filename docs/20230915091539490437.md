 A Serbian player lost a kidney after being elbowed by a South Sudanese player, Nuni Omot, during a World Cup game. The incident occurred when Simanić, the Serbian player, was defending against Omot. Simanić was eventually injured and had to leave the game, effectively ending his participation in the tournament. After the injury, Simanić was immediately taken to a local hospital in Manila, where it was difficult to find a suitable blood donor. As a result, his kidney function was compromised after the game.

Serbian media reported today that Simanić had one of his kidneys removed due to the elbow incident with Omot. It remains unclear how this will affect his health and professional career.

Interestingly, Nuni Omot, the South Sudanese player, is also a national team-level foreign player signed by the Taiwanese T1 League's Taichung Suns this summer. According to reports from Basketnews, Omot expressed his remorse upon learning about the situation, saying, "I heard that he went to the hospital in the end. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do anything dirty. I hope he recovers soon, and I pray for him." Omot continued, "I'm not a dirty player, and I have never been a dirty player. I sincerely apologize to all the viewers of the game, especially the players."
