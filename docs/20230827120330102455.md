  "Lost in the East, Collected in the Sunset: Jaden Ivey Emerges as a Strong Ball Handler"

The mountains stand tall, layered and majestic.

The main discussion revolves around interesting topics or players, occasionally commenting on current events. Among the speedy and athletic guards, the first recommendation is Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies, who has faced off-court scandals. Another player is Russell Westbrook, who won MVP but has moved around in his later career. The focus of this article is Jaden Ivey, who stands at 6-4 and possesses excellent athleticism. Prior to the draft, he was compared to explosive guards like Victor Oladipo and Donovan Mitchell, but the best version of him would be someone who can handle the ball like Morant. Please continue reading to find out more.

Compared to Morant, Ivey bears a closer resemblance to former MVP Westbrook. In college, Morant was already a great ball handler, averaging over 10 assists per game in his sophomore year. Westbrook, on the other hand, had Darren Collison as the primary ball handler during his time at UCLA. Westbrook became a starter in his sophomore year, but his numbers were not impressive, with only 13 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. His unstable outside shooting was a significant flaw.

However, with his extraordinary physical abilities, Westbrook was still regarded as a top ten pick in the draft. Sam Presti, the Thunder's general manager at the time, saw something different in Westbrook and selected him with the fourth overall pick in the 2008 draft, surprising many experts.

In hindsight, it must be said that Presti had a keen eye, as Westbrook exceeded everyone's expectations. With Kevin Durant being selected second overall the previous year and James Harden being selected third overall the following year, the Thunder became the big winners of the draft for three consecutive years, building the strongest young core in the early 2010s.

Returning to the main character of this article, Ivey did not have standout teammates in college, so he became the primary ball handler due to his athleticism and cutting abilities that surpassed others in a different dimension.

However, generally speaking, his ball handling skills are not highly regarded. His ability to dribble with his non-dominant hand needs improvement, and once he cuts inside, he often only focuses on the basket. He has excellent dribbling skills, but lacks the ability to read defenses, making him, at best, a highly athletic work in progress.

Please continue reading. In the summer of 2021, Ivey was selected by the U.S. U19 national team and made it to the finals, where they faced off against the newly drafted French monster, Victor Wembanyama.

In the championship game, Ivey scored the highest 16 points for the team, helping the U.S. defeat France by just two points. Throughout the tournament, he averaged 12 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. Ivey, together with Thunder center Chet Holmgren, was also selected as one of the five best players in the U19 World Cup. After entering the NBA, Ivey was selected fifth overall by the Pistons. At that time, it was widely believed that his excellent athleticism would complement the weaknesses of the 2021 top pick, Cade Cunningham, in terms of explosiveness.

The Pistons had already designated Cunningham as their main ball handler, so Ivey could focus on developing his off-ball skills and outside shooting without bearing heavy ball handling responsibilities initially.

However, for the Pistons, tragedy struck soon after the season started. Cunningham suffered a shin injury, and after resting for a month without improvement, he decided to undergo surgery and miss the entire season.

With the Pistons already having one of the worst records in the league, losing their backcourt commander meant that the season was no longer in suspense, and they ultimately finished with the worst record in the league. Please continue reading. Cunningham's injury provided more opportunities for other players, and the biggest beneficiary was French third-year guard Killian Hayes.

He once again earned a starting opportunity, which meant more than being compared to veteran Cory Joseph. This time, he did not let the opportunity slip away and showcased his talents.

Finally completing a healthy season, Hayes averaged 10 points, 6 assists, and 3 rebounds, displaying excellent defense and a good passing vision, which should earn him a new contract.

For Ivey, this situation was both fortunate and unfortunate. He became the only Pistons player with penetrating abilities and took on the majority of the ball handling responsibilities.

The fortunate aspect is simple - apart from a few exceptional rookies, there are not many newcomers who can handle the ball extensively. Some things need to be faced head-on to understand, such as the level of competition, height, and speed in the NBA. The unfortunate part is that after taking on the ball handling responsibilities, Ivey was unable to strengthen and improve his weaknesses, especially in reading defenses and making correct decisions. In college, Ivey had several offensive weaknesses, including using his non-dominant hand (left hand) for penetration, lacking mid-range scoring ability, having a subpar three-point shooting percentage, and most importantly, lacking the ability to read defenses and make correct decisions. Fortunately, Ivey is naturally talented, and throughout the season, he significantly improved his decision-making abilities. His weaknesses in mid-range scoring also started to become threatening, hinting at the potential of a qualified ball handler.
