 202324 Season Analysis: Portland Trail Blazers New Generation

The Portland Trail Blazers have been one of the most talked about teams in the past month. After a summer full of trade rumors, team leader Damian Lillard finally settled on his future destination before the start of the season. With the subsequent Jrue Holiday trade, the Blazers have quickly undergone a transformation, acquiring a large number of future draft picks and establishing a young core.

With this, the 11-season "Dame Era" has come to an end, and the Blazers will welcome a new generation led by Scoot Henderson. Scoot Henderson will carry the banner for the new generation of the Blazers. 

Roster Changes:
In: Scoot Henderson (draft), Kris Murray (draft), Rayan Rupert (draft), Deandre Ayton (trade), Keon Johnson (trade), Malcolm Brogdon (trade), Drew Eubanks (FA), Justise Winslow (FA), Toumani Camara (trade), Cam Reddish (FA)
Out: Damian Lillard (trade), Jusuf NurkiÄ‡ (trade), Nassir Little (trade)

**Jerami Grant, Matisse Thybulle, and Kevin Knox have re-signed as free agents and are not included in the table.

After a draft and two trades, the Blazers have replaced up to 7 players, which is half of their roster.

Aside from Malcolm Brogdon, who was acquired in a trade with the Celtics, the rest of the new additions are all under 30 years old.

The average age of the Blazers' roster is 23.7, with four rookies expected to play a significant role. It is clear that the Blazers have a strong intention to revamp their team.

Although Jerami Grant and Matisse Thybulle have been re-signed, under the management of Joe Cronin, it is not certain if they will still be on the team by the end of the season. The same goes for Malcolm Brogdon and Robert Williams, who were acquired in trades. Setting aside any future transactions, the Blazers are expected to start the season with the highly anticipated Scoot Henderson as their starting point guard, alongside Anfernee Simons.

Deandre Ayton, who came in through a three-team trade, will be the starting center, while the newly re-signed Jerami Grant and Matisse Thybulle are expected to start in the frontcourt. Last season's Sixth Man of the Year, Malcolm Brogdon, will continue to lead the second unit and join forces with the highly anticipated Shaedon Sharpe.

Rotation:
Starter: Scoot Henderson, Anfernee Simons, Matisse Thybulle, Jerami Grant, Deandre Ayton
Bench: Malcolm Brogdon, Shaedon Sharpe, Kris Murray, Jabari Walker, Robert Williams

Brogdon is willing to take on the role of mentor for the rookies.

The focus of the Blazers this season is not just their record, but the growth of their young players.

With almost half of their roster being rookies or second-year players, it is clear that the Blazers have a strong intention to revamp their team. In terms of talent, Shaedon Sharpe and this year's third overall pick, Scoot Henderson, have the potential to make a name for themselves in the league, but they still lack experience.

As the season progresses, can the young players, led by Scoot, continue to improve with more experience? Can the Blazers properly develop and guide these young players? Their development not only affects the team's performance this season but also the team's future in the coming years. The most exciting thing about young players is their potential for growth.

Even though their performance in the preseason was not ideal, once these young Blazers adapt to the pace of the NBA, they may surprise everyone in the later part of the season.

In addition to the backcourt, rookies Kris Murray, Rayan Rupert, and Toumani Camara are expected to get significant playing time in the frontcourt, and it will be up to them to seize the opportunity.

The Focus:
Despite acquiring two big men through trades, it is clear that the Blazers' roster is still unbalanced. The backcourt is crowded with talent and depth, with players like Henderson, Simons, and Brogdon all needing the ball in their hands. Sharpe also needs the opportunity to develop his skills with the ball. The key for the Blazers will be how they can distribute the ball and organize their offense. From the preseason, it is evident that Scoot has excellent passing vision, but his lack of shooting ability will need to be addressed by outside shooters creating space for him.

Can Simons live up to the high expectations of the team after gaining more opportunities with the ball? Is Sharpe's performance at the end of last season genuine? These questions will be answered as the season progresses.

In the frontcourt, Jerami Grant and Matisse Thybulle are the two pillars of the team, and Deandre Ayton is the biggest wild card this season. Grant's shooting ability will be crucial for the Blazers, and Thybulle is the team's best defensive player. Ayton has shown promise in the preseason, but whether he can continue this performance in the regular season remains to be seen.

Overall, the Blazers will enter a new era this season with a new generation of players. The growth of their young players will be the key to the team's performance. Aside from player development, the management's planning and execution will also determine the Blazers' future direction. Let's hope this new generation of the Blazers can bring excitement to the fans and create a new era for the team.
