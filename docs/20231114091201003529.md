 According to a report from renowned journalist Shams Charania, free agent Rodney McGruder has reached a contract agreement with the Golden State Warriors. The post also includes some teasing comments, suggesting that McGruder and Warriors player Klay Thompson are good buddies. This is because two years ago, during a game between the Pistons and Warriors, there was some tension between McGruder and Warriors players. After the game, Thompson stated, "This guy must be mad because he's on his way out of the league, he's out there trying to start something like he's some big-time player." Green also chimed in, "When did Rodney McGruder become a tough guy?" However, competition and trash talk are inevitable on the court, and it's expected that both players can put their differences aside as professional athletes.

During the 2022-23 regular season, the 193cm tall Rodney McGruder played 32 games as a shooting guard for the Pistons, averaging 16.4 minutes, 5.7 points, 2.3 rebounds, 0.9 assists, and 0.5 steals per game.
