  Kyle Anderson changes his jersey number to 1 in the World Cup, Zeng Fanbo not selected due to injury in the final roster.

According to local Chinese media reports, naturalized Chinese player Kyle Anderson, also known as Li Kai'er, will change his jersey number from 32 to 1 for the upcoming World Cup. The previous owner of the number 1 jersey, Zeng Fanbo, was not selected for the World Cup due to injury.

Zeng Fanbo's injury originated from a fall during a training camp in May. Although he felt some pain at the time, he chose to persevere. After a slight improvement, he went for personal training in the United States and joined the national team for training in Europe. However, during the training in Europe, he was hit during a scrimmage, which worsened his condition and affected his subsequent training and participation in warm-up matches. Reports also mentioned that Zeng Fanbo left the team due to the injury and was disappointed not to be selected for the final World Cup roster. He has since returned to Beijing Shougang team and received guidance from his senior teammates. The team has set up a recovery and training plan for Zeng Fanbo.

As for the reason why Kyle Anderson changed his jersey number, it was because the number 1 became available. He told the media that he has worn the number 1 jersey in many important moments of his basketball career, bringing him infinite strength and motivation.

With the upcoming NBA season, Kyle Anderson will also change his jersey number and wear the familiar number 1 for the Timberwolves.

Furthermore, Kyle Anderson mentioned that his Chinese family told him that the number 1 holds special significance in China, symbolizing smooth sailing, smooth progress, striving for first place, unity, and continuity. Kyle Anderson desires to wear the number 1 jersey and give his all on the court alongside his teammates, leaving no regrets.
