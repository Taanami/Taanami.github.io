 In the NBA game between the Lakers and Clippers, with 5 minutes and 33 seconds left in the second quarter, LeBron James grabbed a defensive rebound in the backcourt. However, his shoe came loose and he had to stop to put it back on. Despite the ongoing game, the ball was quickly passed to the frontcourt. Kawhi Leonard saw LeBron still tying his shoe and took advantage of the numbers to double team D'Angelo Russell, who had the ball. However, Russell managed to break through the double team and pass the ball to Anthony Davis, who quickly gave it to LeBron, who had finished tying his shoe. LeBron then drove in for a one-handed dunk, scoring two points. At halftime, the Clippers lead the Lakers 61-48. The Lakers are looking to end their 11-game losing streak against their crosstown rivals.
