  The Key to Internet Technology at Memphis Grizzlies' Home Court

Although located in a small market, the Memphis Grizzlies have consistently surprised everyone in the past few years by giving the powerhouses a run for their money in the playoffs.

Their strong playing style and never-say-die spirit have delighted fans, but little do people know that there is a hidden secret behind the internet and communication equipment at the Grizzlies' home court.

The tale of misery and resilience of the Grizzlies began in 1995 when they were founded in Vancouver, Canada.

Compared to the Toronto Raptors, who also entered the league from Canada around the same time, the Grizzlies were always considered the league's underdogs, despite the early acquisition of superstar Vince Carter.

With a dismal record and being located on the outskirts, the management decided to relocate the team to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001.

In their six seasons in Vancouver, the Grizzlies left with a dismal record of 101 wins and 359 losses, with a winning percentage of only 22%.

In their first year after the move, the team underwent a transformation, not only coming to the warm and pleasant South but also selecting Spanish power forward Pau Gasol as the third overall pick. In his rookie season, Gasol averaged 17.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 2.7 assists, making him the undeniable cornerstone of the Grizzlies' rebuilding efforts.

Gasol did live up to expectations, leading the team to their first playoff appearance in his third year. However, they faced strong Western Conference teams like the Spurs, Suns, and Mavericks and struggled to secure a win, being swept in the first round three times and leaving behind a playoff record of 0 wins and 12 losses.

Unable to break through to the next level and plagued by Gasol's injuries, the team found themselves in a desperate situation. In the middle of the 2008 season, they traded Gasol to the Lakers for a rebuilding effort, and in return acquired his younger brother, Marc Gasol. When Marc joined the team as a second-round rookie before the 08-09 season, he was a relatively unknown player. However, no one expected that he, along with the young point guard Mike Conley and the disgruntled forward Zach Randolph, acquired in a trade the following summer, would create a formidable Grizzlies team in the Western Conference.

Starting from their legendary upset of the top-seeded Spurs in 2011, the Grizzlies became a force to be reckoned with in the Western Conference. Despite never making it past the Western Conference Finals, they have consistently posed a challenge to division champions such as the Spurs, Warriors, and Thunder. To reach the final stage, teams often have to go through the Grizzlies. Just like the blue-collar atmosphere of Memphis, the Grizzlies' playing style has always been tough, resilient, and relentless. Despite being in a small market, the Grizzlies' strong connection with the local fans is deepened. Players like Conley and Randolph, who are beloved by fans, are both actively involved in community work and have been recipients of the NBA Cares Community Assist Award (Conley has even won it twice). It's not hard to imagine the Grizzlies' position in Memphis.

In addition to actively participating in local education, youth development, health, and fitness initiatives, they are also committed to enhancing the fan experience. Ever since current owner Robert Pera purchased the team in 2012, his mother company, Ubiquiti Inc., has provided technical assistance in ensuring that fans can enjoy seamless internet connectivity while attending games.

However, accessing the internet inside an enclosed arena is not as straightforward as we might think.

The size and design of the venue can create various factors that disrupt signal reception, while the large crowd absorbs radio frequencies, making signal transmission difficult. Additionally, the rapid movement of crowds during popular events means that the arena must meet all the networking needs, from an empty space to a packed house.

From the installation of base stations to surveying and measuring signal coverage, there are numerous variables that add to the challenge. Without careful planning and advanced networking equipment, it is easy to understand why complaints about poor signal reception are common in crowded buildings, such as sports arenas, concerts, or large-scale music events.

The aforementioned challenges have also occurred at the FedEx Forum, the Grizzlies' home court. However, after multiple equipment iterations, Ubiquiti Inc.'s Wi-Fi equipment, UniFi Wireless BaseStation - XG (UWB-XG), has successfully showcased their excellent technology to the world.
