NBA: Warriors Defeat Lakers in Away Game with Podziemski's Clutch Free Throws

In the second preseason game between the Warriors and Lakers, both teams' starters were present, including LeBron James who did not play in the previous game. However, it was the Warriors who emerged victorious in the end, thanks to a late-game surge led by Jackson-Davis' putback, and clutch free throws from Podziemski and Kuminga.

The Lakers had a strong first half, leading by as much as 13 points in the second quarter. However, the Warriors fought back and closed the gap to only seven points at halftime. With the starters resting in the second half, the Warriors' bench players, including rookies Brandin Podziemski, Jonathan Kuminga, and Moses Moody, stepped up to contribute in the fourth quarter.

Despite the Lakers' efforts, their G League prospects like D'Moi Hodge, Alex Fudge, and Colin Castleton, also had impressive performances in the final quarter. However, Castleton's go-ahead layup with 45 seconds left was not enough to secure the win, as Hood-Schifino's layup was blocked, giving the Warriors the victory. The Lakers' starting five all scored in double digits, with LeBron James playing only half the game and finishing with 12 points and 5 assists. Austin Reaves had the best performance among the starters, with 16 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, and 2 steals.

New Lakers teammates Taurean Prince and Christian Wood also had strong performances with 17 and 13 points respectively. The Warriors, on the other hand, fielded their full starting lineup, but only Stephen Curry scored in double digits with 18 points, 4 assists, and 3 rebounds. It was the bench players who shined for the Warriors, with Kuminga maintaining his good form and scoring 26 points on 9-of-12 shooting, while rookie Podziemski recorded a double-double with 10 points and 10 assists.
