 The Player's Union declined to participate in the cross-league invitation tournament organized by the Chinese Basketball Association (referred to as CBA) for the 2023 Asian Games Men's Basketball Team. After discussions among the team members, they hope to maintain their established training schedule and do not wish to participate in the related competition. To avoid a repeat of past mistakes, the Player's Union requests a positive response from the CBA regarding the proposed "establishment of the 'Procedure for Inviting Players to Participate in International Competitions' and 'Model Participation Agreement'." They hope to discuss and implement game classification, eliminate communication barriers caused by information asymmetry, and create conditions for players' active participation, allowing the national team to enter a systematic and modernized approach. It is reiterated once again that "transparency of information and open communication" has been the consistent principle of the professional baseball union since their demand for international game rights protection in 2013, and the basketball union will also follow suit. The players are not refusing the opportunity to represent the country and pursue honor, but they hope that before being labeled as "disregarding honor and pursuing personal gain," we can reflect on why Taiwanese basketball is not willing to make the necessary efforts and preparations in terms of systems and plans. Before arranging for political leaders from various parties to throw the first pitch, present awards, host banquets, and distribute appearance fees, should we not focus on more "fundamental projects that truly help athletes' careers"? And if change is not now, then when?
