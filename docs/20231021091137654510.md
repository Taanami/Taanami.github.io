With the arrival of Zhang Shuren as the new GM, the Siege Lions have undergone some changes both on and off the court. First, their title sponsor has ended their partnership, and the team name will go back to "Hsinchu Siege Lions" as they start anew. The long-vacant GM position is now filled by Zhang Shuren, who previously served as the GM of New Taipei Citibank and the secretary general of the T1 League. He hopes to bring changes from within and elevate the team to pursue their first championship in history.

Zhang Shuren holds a Master of Business Administration from Johns Hopkins University and has held various positions in media and team management. He is familiar with both baseball and basketball industries, and has also served as a public relations and spokesperson for international events. He is highly respected in the industry and is considered one of the top management talents.

[Exclusive interview] Zhang Shuren, the new GM of the Hsinchu Street Attack Lions: "We want to bring Hsinchu's support to the world and exchange with other teams." The above is an excerpt from a previous interview with Zhang Shuren by the author. If you are interested in his thoughts and expectations for the future of the team, please take some time to read the full interview. Zhang Shuren has held various positions and changed teams in the past few years, but he always talks about completing each stage of his mission, which shows his high standards and execution in different roles. Facing the changing trend of basketball development in Asia, it was the main reason for him to take on the role of GM once again. He hopes to lead the team to go international and become a professional team.

From recent news, it seems that their efforts are already in motion and more people are starting to take notice.

They have also taken their long-trained youth team to visit the home court of the Ryukyu Golden Kings, for venue tours and friendly matches, to help the team grow both on and off the court. Recently, they also went to Xiamen to participate in the "Xiamen Professional Basketball Invitational" and will head to Singapore at the end of the month to participate in the FIBA Continental Cup showcase game. They will also travel with fans and the Lion Girls to cheer on the team. Since Zhang Shuren's arrival, these efforts have been accelerated and executed more efficiently. As for the team roster, Zhang Shuren believes: "In the past two years, I have come to understand the importance of team basketball. The focus of this off-season preparation for the Siege Lions is how to develop our local players and combine them with the strengths of foreign players on both ends of the court." With the foreign players yet to be finalized, there is still plenty of room for exploration and maneuvering. Fans can look forward to seeing who will join the team. As for local operations, he said: "In the past three years, the Siege Lions and the Lion Purple Army have truly embodied the concept of 'this city needs a team'. I hope that in the next season, in addition to being the team that brings the city together the most, we will also bring glory back to this city."

It seems that they are ready for a transformation. Please continue reading below ▼ With the arrival of the European-style assistant coach, can the Lion Army spark a team revolution? Zhang Shuren's first move as GM was to recruit Serbian coach Milan Mitrovic to the coaching staff, hoping to inject a European style of play into the team and achieve their first victory. When making the official announcement, he mentioned: "European players have a deep understanding of basketball and are able to read the game situation well. By recruiting a Serbian assistant coach, we hope to bring elements of European basketball to help the Siege Lions implement their team basketball philosophy." It seems that they may be looking to replicate the successful model of the Yellow to Purple transition to build a new team.

At the age of 42, Mitrovic has rich coaching experience and is particularly good at player development. He has served as an assistant coach in various European leagues, including Serbia, Romania, and Poland. From 2014 to 2021, he was the assistant coach of CSM Oradea in the Romanian Basketball League, a team that regularly makes it to the playoffs and has helped them win the championship three times. He has even had a role in the national team. After a brief stint in the Polish league two years ago, he returned to Romania last year to become the head coach of FC Arges Pitesti. This is his first time coaching in Asia.

When interviewed, Mitrovic said: "I will pay special attention to defensive details in the future. I believe that the subtle aspects of defense will be the key to winning in the future. I will analyze each player's strengths and weaknesses through videos and provide assistance to head coach Kuan Lun both in team training and individual skill development." This touches on the Lion team's biggest weakness from last year, where they ranked last in the league with an average of 99.6 points allowed per game. By strengthening their defense through discipline and a systematic team connection, they may be able to turn things around.

At this stage of transformation, the key personnel both on and off the court are in place. The next step is to see how the players adapt and perform, as well as the fluidity of their basketball operations. These are all concerns of the fans, and with the guidance of GM Zhang Shuren, the team's atmosphere is expected to be different. We look forward to more surprises and glory from the Siege Lions in the upcoming season.
