 Longyao Cup, the strongest college basketball tournament in Taiwan, is back for its 10th edition. This year, in addition to the college division, high school teams from Japan, South Korea, the United States, and the Philippines have been invited to compete, aiming to create a highly competitive international stage and enhance the players' international competitiveness. Longyao Cup has been committed to supporting student basketball and has gained recognition as the "HBL Preseason" and the "Taiwan Basketball Championship." In previous editions, the tournament has featured warm-up matches with the U16 Taiwan team, invited teams from China, and established a platform for cross-strait exchanges.

The 10th Longyao Cup will feature 51 teams from domestic high schools and colleges, along with five international teams. The invited international teams include representative high schools from Japan, South Korea, the United States, and the Philippines, known for producing national team players, international stars, and even FIBA Hall of Famers. The arrival of these strong teams will surely bring exciting matchups and sparks on the court.

As the Longyao Cup welcomes its tenth year, Chairman Xie Jianguo continues to support the development of student sports through action. He believes that in the post-pandemic era, there are numerous international sporting events, especially in Asia, particularly Japan, where there has been explosive growth in overall strength. Chairman Xie sees it as crucial for Taiwan to keep up and even surpass this development, making it an important part of sports cultivation.

The 10th Longyao Cup will take place from September 4th to September 17th at the Xinzhuang Gymnasium and Nanshan High School Gymnasium in New Taipei City. The opening ceremony will be held on September 11th. The tournament will last for two weeks, with a single elimination format for the college division and the high school division competing against the international teams in the second stage for the ultimate championship.

Admission to the games is free, and there will be various themed games, lucky draws, and market stalls. Basketball enthusiasts are invited to join and enjoy the event.
