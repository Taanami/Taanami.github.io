Cao Xun-Xiang revealed, "He knocks on our door every morning and calls me to go shoot, he's crazy!" Lin Ping-Sheng, who was a hot topic this summer due to his contract, scored 7 points in the opening game today and scored 10 points in the first 12 minutes of the team, but the Flying Monkeys and Dream Team later surpassed them and fell behind 20:22 in the first quarter. The team was tied in the second quarter by Dongfang Yiyi's 8 points, but Cao Xun-Xiang and Lin Yi-Hui scored consecutively, helping Taipei Taixin War God maintain a 67:61 lead after three quarters, and then pulling away in the fourth quarter, eventually winning 88:69 for their third consecutive victory.

Cao Xun-Xiang only played for 9 minutes yesterday before being fouled out, but today he played for 22 minutes, scoring 21 points and dishing out 6 assists. He laughed and said, "I made up for the playing time I missed yesterday, playing more than twice as long as yesterday." He also revealed that after joining Taipei Taixin War God, he became neighbors with Lin Ping-Sheng, and his new teammate would knock on his door at 9 am, and even after team training and weightlifting at night, Lin Ping-Sheng didn't let him go.

"At 9:30 pm, he would still call me to go to the riverbank to shoot. He's just that crazy!" Cao Xun-Xiang also revealed that he followed Lin Ping-Sheng in training early in the morning and late at night, and after doing it once, he even vomited, to which Lin Ping-Sheng laughed and said, "That's why he lost weight, his goal is to lose 16 kg (the weight Lin Yi-Hui lost)." Why would he go to the riverbank for self-training at night? Lin Ping-Sheng smiled and said, "I feel like I'm not good enough, so I need to train more and learn more." The Dream Team Training Team member of the Flying Monkeys, Dongfang Yiyi, was Lin Ping-Sheng's former teammate, and he coincidentally mentioned that during their time at Shin Kong, they often trained independently and went to the riverbank to practice shooting, which was in line with Cao Xun-Xiang's statement.
