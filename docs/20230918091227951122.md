# The Basketball Association and Hsinchu Kansu Lions held their first coordination meeting today 
 The Basketball Association and Hsinchu Kansu Lions held their first coordination meeting today. The following is the statement from the Basketball Association regarding the coordination meeting: Previously, the Hsinchu Kansu Lions issued an ultimatum, demanding Lin Ping-sheng to fulfill his contract by September 1st, otherwise they would exhaust all legal means to prevent Lin Ping-sheng from playing for other teams. However, Lin Ping-sheng has continued to participate in the training of the Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors, indicating that he has decided not to fulfill the contract with the Kansu Lions. As for the outcome of this coordination meeting, there is no clear result for now. After further discussions between the two parties, it is likely that a second coordination meeting will be held in the near future.
