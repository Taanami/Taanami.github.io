  2023 TGF Shengsheng Fire Fighting Continuation Cup Basketball Team Interview - Tungsheng Freezer

Tungsheng Freezer, who won the national championship in the inter-school division of the 2020 Continuation Cup, returned to the tournament this year as a senior team. They advanced to the national competition as the champions of the southern region and ultimately finished as the national runners-up. This achievement will undoubtedly make Tungsheng Freezer even stronger. After three years, Tungsheng Freezer has made significant progress in team and playing strength. Let's hear their story! Please continue reading.

Tungsheng Freezer was founded by team leader Chen Weihao in 2019. Chen Weihao admitted that the team's establishment went smoothly in the beginning. At that time, Tungsheng Freezer only competed in the high school division, and in terms of high school basketball, they were almost unbeatable with very few losses. However, the real challenge was stepping out of their comfort zone and entering the social division. The level of competition in the social division was much higher than the high school division, and it was not easy to establish a new team with only a group of talented high school students. In the beginning, they encountered many obstacles, but after two or three years of university experience, the players' physical abilities improved significantly, and they were able to adapt to high-intensity games, gradually reaching their peak performance.

When recruiting players, Tungsheng Freezer prioritizes character over basketball skills. Players not only represent themselves but also the team. In recent years, team leader Chen Weihao actively recruited players to join the Tungsheng Freezer family. As the veteran players graduated from high school and went their separate ways, it was necessary to search for new talents in the southern high school region to add new blood and strengthen the team's competitiveness.

Leading a team requires not only leading people but also leading their hearts. To cultivate a player in the long run, it is essential to consider this aspect. Chen Weihao said, "Most of our players have been with me for three or four years since high school. We also have new blood joining us. I often chat with the players, and we often gather together to practice off the court. I give them a stage to perform, and when the team achieves good results, we are not hesitant to reward the players. This allows the players to have confidence in themselves and the team on and off the court. Everyone is proud to be a part of Tungsheng Freezer."

"My competitive spirit is strong, and I want to lead the team to win as a team. I don't want to recruit mercenaries for one or two tournaments and then disband. Because we all have the same dream and goal, we prepare for every game to win and make all Tungsheng members confident in our team brand."

Recalling the Continuation Cup three years ago, Tungsheng Freezer's Huang Shaobo first sealed the championship for the southern region by scoring a buzzer-beater against Fuxiang Township. Then, in the national competition, Lin Yusheng made another fast break to beat CHH and win the national championship. When Tungsheng Freezer returned this year, all the crazy memories of that year came rushing back, and I believe this memory will always remain in the players' hearts.

Tungsheng Freezer returned to their home, the Continuation Cup, this year. Chen Weihao said, "I am truly touched. It's such a familiar feeling, and all the memories of the Continuation Cup come flooding back. Even though we are no longer high school students, the games in the university senior division are still full of passion. The Continuation Cup is an important stage for players."

This year, Tungsheng Freezer defeated their fierce rival Fuming International in the southern region championship game. However, in the national championship game, the two teams met again, but this time, Tungsheng Freezer did not come out victorious. But as the saying goes, "when we win, it doesn't mean everything is right; on the contrary, when we lose, it doesn't mean everything is wrong. In fact, sometimes failure is also a kind of victory." Chen Weihao also said, "I don't feel ashamed of this defeat. It will only make us stronger, and next time we meet in the same place, it won't be as easy."

On the road to realizing his dream, Chen Weihao is most grateful to his father. When he wanted to establish a team, his father and a few good friends supported him without hesitation, allowing him to move forward without any worries and hoping that the players can develop their basketball skills and soar high. Finally, Chen Weihao would like to say to all the players of Tungsheng Freezer, "Thank you all for your hard work in the Continuation Cup! Remember the lessons from the national championship game, and we will get our revenge in the future. I am very grateful for your participation and for representing Tungsheng in the games. I am sincerely proud of all of you, and I want to win more than anyone else, but as players, there are some things we cannot resist on the court. All we can do is fight back with our goals and win the game to prove ourselves. I hope everyone enjoys the atmosphere of playing basketball and the glory of being a member of Tungsheng. Let's not miss out next year and take back our championship!"
