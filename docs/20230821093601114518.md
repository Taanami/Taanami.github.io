The head coach of UC Irvine, Russell Turner, led his team to a 95-80 victory over the Chinese Blue team in the recent Jones Cup tournament. The question of the disparity between Asian and American teams has sparked discussions. Where does the national team's level stand in the NCAA Division I basketball league in the United States? Coach Russell Turner first responded to the game by expressing his gratitude for the opportunity to come to Taiwan and participate in the Jones Cup. He was amazed by the atmosphere at the venue and the dedication of Taiwanese fans who cheered for the teams. The Chinese team took the lead in the first quarter, which could have easily knocked them out. Regarding his team's counterattack, Coach Turner described them as playing like a championship team. The players showed great determination to win this game and emphasized the importance they placed on the Jones Cup. He believes that their ability to win the championship in this tournament is due to the team's depth and athleticism, which align well with the format of the Jones Cup. When asked about how Asian teams perform in NCAA Division I, Coach Turner stated that his team is also strong. Last year, they came close to defeating San Diego State University, which eventually reached the NCAA championship game. The Chinese Blue team, according to Coach Turner, is a highly competitive team in NCAA Division I and can defeat most mid-tier universities. On certain days, they can even win against strong opponents because of their good teamwork. He praised the team's organizers and coaching staff for showcasing the team's strengths. Coach Turner also mentioned that the key to winning in NCAA Division I is for players to possess intelligence and resilience, which not only applies to winning in NCAA Division I but also to winning games anywhere in the world.
