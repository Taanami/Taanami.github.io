 202324 Key Player: Keegan Murray, Sacramento Kings

Recapping the 2022-23 rookie season, Keegan Murray broke Donovan Mitchell's record for most threes in a rookie season (187) with 206 threes made. What's even more impressive is that this record was achieved with an impressive 41.1% three-point shooting percentage, proving that Keegan is not just a volume shooter, but also an efficient one. This was made possible by the Kings' emphasis on pace and space tactics, as well as the presence of All-Star Domantas Sabonis and the career-best season of De'Aaron Fox, who helped create open shots for Keegan.

According to BBall-Index, out of the 22 players who played over 1,000 minutes and ranked in the top 10% for three-point percentage and threes made, only Joe Harris, Jevon Carter, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Malcolm Brogdon had a higher 3PT shot quality than Keegan. This shows that his high three-point shooting percentage was not just due to his own shooting ability, but also the good shot quality he was given by the team. With the Kings making their first playoff appearance in 16 years, even though they had home court advantage, they faced the defending champions, the Golden State Warriors. In a high-pressure and intense series, Keegan struggled in the first three games with only 3.3 points and 4 rebounds per game. However, he surprised everyone in the following games and helped the Kings push the series to a game 7.

During the regular season, Keegan averaged only 4.6 rebounds per game, but in the next four games, he showed his ability to rebound by averaging 8 rebounds and scoring double digits in every game. Although the Kings eventually lost the series, Keegan's impact in the later games gave fans and the organization high hopes for his future performances. Visible transformation

Every summer is a turning point for NBA players' transformation. Last summer, even during his honeymoon, Fox continued to train hard, which led to his breakout season in 2022-23.

As his rookie season ended, Keegan did not take a break and instead trained with Fox during the offseason, with Fox even taking on the role of a mentor. This raises expectations for Keegan's development in the upcoming season, as he has the opportunity to learn from his All-Star teammate. In an interview, Keegan mentioned that they often play one-on-one during their training sessions, and although he has never won against Fox, fans saw a glimpse of what they wanted to see at the California Classic.

Even though Keegan had a high efficiency in catch-and-shoot threes, 97.6% of his three-pointers were assisted, which raised doubts about his ability to create his own shots at the NBA level. However, in the California Classic, Keegan proved that he can also create his own shots. In the first game against the Warriors, he scored a game-high 29 points and showed his ability to dribble and finish with a powerful dunk. In the second game against the Miami Heat, he scored 29 points and led the Kings to victory. In the third game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, he hit the game-winning three-pointer despite facing intense defense. And in the final game against the Portland Trail Blazers, he hit the game-winning three-pointer again, helping the Kings complete a perfect record in the California Classic.

In summary, Keegan showed more of his ability to create his own shots and make crucial plays in these four games, which he lacked in his rookie season. This raises expectations for his performance in the upcoming season.

As a key player for the Sacramento Kings, Keegan will have more opportunities to prove himself in the new season. He will continue to work hard and become a scoring machine for the team, leading them to greater achievements. In him, we see the growth and potential of a young player, and we look forward to seeing him continue to showcase his skills and become one of the pillars of the Kings.
