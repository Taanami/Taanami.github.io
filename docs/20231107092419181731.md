According to ESPN reporter Adrian Wojnarowski, the Sacramento Kings have decided to waive Nerlens Noel, who they just signed from the free agency this summer, along with young player Neemias Queta. The main reason for this decision is the recent signing of center JaVale McGee, who was waived by the Dallas Mavericks.

On July 19th, the Kings had just reached a one-year $3.1 million contract with Noel (news link), but in less than two months, they have signed McGee and now have a surplus of centers, leading to the decision to waive two players at once.

It was previously reported that Noel's contract was only partially guaranteed and he would have to play the entire season to receive the full amount of $3.1 million. However, in less than two months, the Kings found a better replacement for the center position and have decided to let Noel go and find a new team. This leaves the Kings with Domantas Sabonis as the starting center, with Alex Len and JaVale McGee as backups. In the 2022-23 regular season, Nerlens Noel played for the Pistons and Nets, appearing in 17 games with an average of 11.5 minutes per game, scoring 2.1 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 0.9 steals.
