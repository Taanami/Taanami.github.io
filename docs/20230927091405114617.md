  Reunion with Philippines Brings Back Important Memories of the 2023 World Cup

38 years ago, Arthur 'Chip' Engelland played his last official game in the Philippines. Since then, he had only returned to the country once. However, in a different sense, he never felt like he left.

Engelland is currently the shooting coach for the USA team in the World Cup. He is not surprised that fans recognize him from the sidelines, as even in the United States, many Filipino-Americans would approach him on the streets for photos. "If it's like this in the United States, I can imagine that even more people would recognize me in the Philippines," Engelland said.

"I haven't played on the court for almost 40 years, and yet I can still be recognized in the United States. The Filipino fans are really great. I once met a few passionate fans in Las Vegas, and we sat down and chatted about PBA and the country we miss," Engelland continued. This signifies the indelible imprint Engelland left in the Philippine basketball scene. Engelland may be the best pure shooter in the history of PBA. After graduating from Duke University, he came to the Philippines to play in the PBA. He played in 76 games in three PBA cups, averaging 27.5 points per game, with a record high of 60 points in a single game. His accurate shooting earned him the nickname "Machine Gun" from Filipino fans.

Engelland was also a member of the famous Northern Consolidated Corporation (NCC) in the 1980s. NCC was a team assigned by then Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to participate in international tournaments, with Eduardo "Danding" Cojuangco, the owner of Northern Consolidated Corporation, serving as the national team director.

The team trained together for several months and essentially became a club team not affiliated with any league. It included four naturalized players, including Engelland. In 1982, they helped the Philippines secure fourth place in the Asian Games held in India. In 1985, NCC won the Asian Championship in Kuala Lumpur and earned the right to participate in the 1986 FIBA World Championship in Spain. They also won the William Jones Cup in 1985, defeating the representative team from Purdue University. Engelland scored 43 points in that game, saying, "Without Jeff Moore and Dennis Still, we wouldn't have won the Jones Cup. We were a versatile and strong team with great chemistry, and we still keep in touch."

These achievements representing the Philippines are reasons that Filipinos and Filipino-Americans proudly talk about. "Basketball is the national sport in the Philippines, and our performance in international tournaments allowed many fans to see us," Engelland explained.

After the conclusion of the NCC project in 1986, Engelland returned to the United States. He played in several minor leagues before retiring and transitioning to become a shooting coach. He organized camps and served as a personal training consultant for players. He earned the nickname "Shot Doctor" and counted current USA team head coach Steve Kerr and general manager Grant Hill among his clients.

In the 1999-2000 season, Engelland joined the Detroit Pistons as an assistant shooting coach. Three years later, he became the director of player development for the Denver Nuggets. He then spent 17 years as an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs, helping them win two NBA championships. Players like Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, and Dejounte Murray broke through their ceilings under his guidance. Engelland is widely recognized as one of the top assistant coaches in the NBA. Kerr had always wanted to bring him on board as a shooting coach for the Golden State Warriors, but their collaboration eventually happened on the national team.

Engelland is now a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder, preparing to develop a group of talented young players such as Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. This includes current Canadian and Australian national team mainstays and highly cultivated Thunder players Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey. Giddey highly regards Engelland's guidance, saying, "Since Engelland joined, I've been practicing shooting with him almost every day, 2 to 3 times. I spend a lot of time receiving his instructions. He's truly a genius."

Engelland briefly mentioned his two proteges, saying, "With SGA and Josh, Canada and Australia are definitely formidable obstacles for us to win the championship. They have proven themselves in the NBA." However, due to the busy schedule and his main focus on helping the USA team win the championship, Engelland hasn't had many opportunities to watch the current Philippine national team games. "I spend a lot of time studying opponents and assisting USA team players, but I know they have many competitive games," he added.

It has been 17 years since Engelland last visited the Philippines, and his stay this time is only for a few days. As he tries to reconnect with the city he once called home, Engelland mentioned, "There are many places I no longer recognize. I can identify some people and things, and there are some streets and landmarks that I can still recognize. But there are too many new buildings, so I have to find new landmarks to navigate. But I'm enjoying my stay this time." Engelland also mentioned that due to the busy schedule, his main task is to help the USA team win the championship, so he hasn't had many opportunities to watch the current Philippine national team games. "I spend a lot of time studying opponents and assisting USA team players, but I know they have many competitive games," he added.
