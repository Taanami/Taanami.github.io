  A Victorious but Shameful Win for Chinese Taipei against Mongolia

To be frank, the Mongolian team had just lost to Hong Kong and did not even bring their main players to this Asian Games. In terms of physicality and individual skills, they were clearly no match for the Chinese Taipei players. It was expected that Chinese Taipei would easily win the game, with a 20-point lead considered a failure. However, they had to fight till the last second against Mongolia and barely secured a victory with their opponent missing a shot.

Against Mongolia's smaller size, Chinese Taipei immediately attacked the inside and successfully scored with Atieno's low post attacks. They also used cut and pass tactics to break through Mongolia's defense and took advantage of their taller players to score after drawing double teams. Substitute Abassi also showed his skills as a foreign player with his cutting and finishing ability, leaving Mongolia unable to keep up with his speed and changes of direction.

However, as comfortable as their offense was, their defense was equally terrible. Mongolia effectively used Atieno's lateral movement and Chinese Taipei's weakness in their twin tower system, creating opportunities for outside shooting and quick layups. But this cannot be used as an excuse for Chinese Taipei's poor defense.

Was it the coaching staff's failure to set up a proper defensive plan before the game? Or was Chinese Taipei's defense simply that bad? Should they switch to front or backcourt defense? Should their tall players retreat or change to man-to-man defense? The players seemed confused about which defensive strategy to execute, resulting in a complete breakdown of their team defense.

When the opponent used a four-small-one-big lineup, Chinese Taipei's power forward failed to provide any countermeasures despite having a physical advantage.

Lin Ting-chien, who had been performing well in the previous two games, had a rare off night in terms of his shooting. In my opinion, he had more opportunities in the previous games due to being involved in pick-and-rolls, which allowed him to find his rhythm. However, in this game, with Atieno dominating the low post, it was harder for him to find his position. This led to fewer shot attempts in the early stages and affected his focus on defense.

Regardless of their individual or team performance, it is crucial for Lin Ting-chien to learn how to control the pace of the game, contribute on both ends of the court, and make plays for his teammates. Source: Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee

It wasn't until the second half that Chinese Taipei finally found their rhythm on defense, with Liu Zhen and Abassi's aggressive pressure and steals creating pressure for Mongolia. Combined with the opponent's exhaustion in the fourth quarter, Chinese Taipei was able to come back and win. They definitely have the capability to play high-pressure defense, but it requires all players to actively participate in rotation and communication. Liu Zhen and Abassi's individual efforts were in vain, as it wasn't until the fourth quarter that the team finally played the defense they should have from the beginning. This is not the mindset of a team aiming for the best results at the Asian Games.

Chinese Taipei's performance in this game could only be described as a failure. Their defensive rotation and communication were lacking, players' offensive positioning was unclear, and it's hard to believe that they had a three-month training camp with the goal of achieving the best result at the Asian Games. After their loss to China in the previous game, I had hoped that Chinese Taipei would take their weaknesses seriously and improve, but unfortunately, their defense only got worse. Whether it's the basketball association, coaching staff, or players, they all need to reflect on their performance.
