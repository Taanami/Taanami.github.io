  Solo during the World Cup, Reaves Sticks Out His Tongue and Lithuanian Player Responds: "I Know His Brother, He Told Me to Trash Talk Him"

In yesterday's round of 16 match at the FIBA World Cup, Lithuanian player Vaidas Kariniauskas successfully made a low post move against Los Angeles Lakers player Austin Reaves. He stuck out his tongue at him and after the game, Lithuania emerged victorious. This image quickly spread across various social media platforms.

During an interview after the game, Vaidas Kariniauskas talked about the tongue gesture. He said, "This has nothing to do with what happened on the court. It's simply a passion for the game. Last season, I played on the same team as Austin Reaves' brother, and before the game, we had a conversation. Reaves' brother told me, 'Trash talk Reaves a bit.' So, I did it (stuck out my tongue)." Austin Reaves' brother is named Spencer Reaves, 27 years old, and played for Bamberg in the top tier of the German league last season, averaging 6.7 points and 2 rebounds per game. He will be playing for SC Rasta Vechta in the second tier of the German league next season.

In addition to trash talking Reaves, there were also scenes of celebration captured after the game. Again, it was Vaidas Kariniauskas who was seen wearing a Team USA hat in the locker room. This sparked discussions among the public. The United States suffered a loss against Lithuania yesterday, falling behind by a significant margin in the first half. They made an effort to catch up in the second half but fell short. They only secured a second-place finish in their group and will face Italy in the quarterfinals.
