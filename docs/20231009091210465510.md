 NBA Pelicans' Jose Alvarado's ankle injury is uncertain for training camp 

According to reporter Shams Charania, Pelicans' guard Jose Alvarado injured his ankle during training, and it is currently unknown whether he will be able to catch up with the training camp starting at the end of September. The Pelicans have also suffered the loss of Trey Murphy this summer (meniscus surgery, expected to rest until mid-November), resulting in a significant impact on their team's strength. Alvarado was affected by a shinbone injury last season, only playing in 61 games. Originally scheduled to play for Puerto Rico during the summer, the Pelicans did not release him. Unexpectedly, he suffered an ankle injury before the start of the season. He averaged 9 points, 3 assists, and 2.3 rebounds per game last year, making him an important backup guard for the Pelicans.
