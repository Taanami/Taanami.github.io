# NBA American reporter's report on the Lillard incident 
 NBA American reporter's report on the Lillard incident. Lillard had expressed his desire to stay with the Trail Blazers but was rejected.

The Damian Lillard trade was completed early yesterday morning, generating significant discussion throughout the league. Today, reporter Chris Haynes wrote a lengthy article detailing the developments of the past few months regarding the Lillard trade.

Haynes chronologically describes the sequence of events. After Lillard expressed his desire for a trade, communication between the Heat and the Trail Blazers was limited to the summer league in early July. Subsequent attempts to have face-to-face discussions about the trade did not materialize.

At this point, the Trail Blazers released a statement indicating that they would seek the best offer and were not limited to the Miami Heat. Lillard's camp made it clear that he would not be satisfied unless it was a move to the Heat. The league intervened to mediate the situation. However, there was no news about this matter after the summer league. Lillard's agent, Aaron Goodwin, took action and suggested that Lillard have a conversation with general manager Joe Cronin. Both agreed to meet. During the meeting, Lillard expressed his disappointment with how the situation was being handled, and Cronin assured him that he would pursue the most attractive package. At that moment, Lillard knew that it was unlikely for him to go to the Heat.

Haynes further wrote in the article that during the meeting, Lillard even told Cronin, "If there's no way to go to the Heat, then he would rather withdraw the trade and return to the Trail Blazers." Cronin responded directly, stating that Lillard could not return to the team. Naturally, Lillard was surprised to hear this news and felt extremely frustrated about not being able to return to Portland. Lillard still believed that he might not leave the Trail Blazers, so he continued training at the team's facility. Lillard told reporters, "I'm still on the roster, and I usually train there at this time. I'm not there to create problems. That's not who I am. Everyone except General Manager Cronin is happy to see me. Cronin has never spoken to me, and when I noticed that, I made up my mind not to go talk to Cronin."

Lillard's camp was eager to resolve this matter, so his agent also reached out to the Bucks and the Nets. The reporter also reported that Bucks general manager Jon Horst regularly inquired about the possibility of trading for Lillard, but both sides preferred to have their star players stay with their respective teams.

In the end, tensions between Lillard's camp and the Trail Blazers organization escalated, leading the league to hold another coordination meeting to address the communication issues between the Trail Blazers and Lillard's camp. Cronin promised to improve the communication channels. In fact, the reporter mentioned in the article that Cronin deliberately distanced himself from Lillard's camp to avoid jeopardizing other potential trades. Ultimately, the trade was completed before the start of training camp, with the Trail Blazers acquiring Deandre Ayton, Jrue Holiday, a first-round pick, and two pick swaps. Jrue Holiday could even be resold to other teams.
