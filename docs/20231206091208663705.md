 The open Wi-Fi network at the Jazz's home arena is named "JordanPushedOff." According to reports from Bleacher Report, this is a reference to a famous moment during the 1998 NBA Finals when Michael Jordan made his "Last Shot" over Byron Russell. The play has sparked much debate over whether or not Jordan pushed off Russell before making the shot.
