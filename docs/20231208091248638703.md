  Interview with the cutest sports anchor Li Yi-Han: A jersey represents not only a team, but also a spirit.

Li Yi-Han, who is currently working as a sports anchor on Elta TV, recalls her first experience as an event host at an outdoor basketball game in Taoyuan. The game was using ANGO's innovative "light-up ball", which amazed her and left a deep impression of the brand.

During her time at Videoland Sports Channel, Li Yi-Han noticed that teams like Tai Power and Tatung were wearing ANGO jerseys while broadcasting the "Taiwan Enterprise Football League". This sparked her interest in getting to know ANGO and she discovered that ANGO is not just a sports equipment manufacturer, but also develops high-quality jerseys for both football and basketball, providing athletes with more diverse jersey options.

Please continue reading to learn about the encounter between the new generation sports anchor and the new generation sports brand and jerseys. What kind of new imagination will it bring to the sports circle and Taiwan's sports industry? What does the perfect jersey look like in the eyes of a sports anchor? Despite being a new sports brand, ANGO's jersey designs are refreshing and the material is suitable for athletes' needs.

Seeing Taiwan having its own high-quality jersey brand, Li Yi-Han shared her vision of the perfect jersey: "The first thing that catches my eye is the design and color, and then the comfort. It should be able to absorb sweat and dry quickly, especially during intense games where players need to go on court frequently. The jersey should be able to dry quickly after washing for the next game."

During the interview, Li Yi-Han was wearing an ANGO jersey and when asked about her experience with it, she praised, "I think ANGO has done a great job. Not only does it look good and feel comfortable, but it also pays attention to details that are important for women, such as whether it is see-through, has good coverage, and the sleeveless part won't reveal the side of the chest."

Please continue reading. It is clear that creating a good jersey is not easy. Besides maintaining high-quality standards and being comfortable to wear, it also requires design considerations to meet the needs of the users, which requires the brand's dedication. Please continue reading. From football to basketball, ANGO's professional jerseys lead in high-end functionality and performance. Li Yi-Han, who has been paying attention to the sports circle for a long time, has loved playing basketball since high school and also joined the basketball team in college. Her first job after entering the workforce was as a sports reporter, showing her close relationship with sports.

Therefore, she also views the influence of sports brands from a different perspective based on her own experiences. "I know that this year's JHBL (Junior High School Basketball League) is sponsored by ANGO, providing customized jerseys, warm-up gear, and socks for players. I think this is a great thing. It not only means recognition for the JHBL, but also allows more people to see the strength of Taiwan's sports brand, creating a mutual support and benefit." Based on her experience playing basketball as a student, Li Yi-Han understands the importance of getting sponsored and encouraged for student teams. Therefore, she highly appreciates ANGO's management in grassroots sports, such as sponsoring balls and jerseys.

Although ANGO has expanded its supply chain and entered the basketball market, it still maintains an environmentally friendly manufacturing process, which made Li Yi-Han impressed by the brand's commitment to environmental protection. Just like how a perfect jersey needs to consider not only the athletes but also the entire industry ecosystem and manufacturing environment. If a brand can also maintain an environmentally friendly mindset, it is not only benefiting the sports circle, but also contributing to the planet. A jersey represents not only a team, but also a spirit. Li Yi-Han, who has reported countless games, chose to enter this industry because of her admiration and curiosity for television work, as well as her passion and love for sports. She has been steadily advancing in her career and even earned the title of "cutest anchor", which reflects her innocent enthusiasm and professionalism in her work.

Passion and perseverance are essential qualities in sports, just like in work. "I think work is just like sports, we need to constantly improve our professionalism and skills." Li Yi-Han has a serious and determined attitude. Despite being under scrutiny and receiving negative comments from online bullies due to her celebrity status, she is willing to change her mindset and continue to challenge herself. "My next goal is to improve my skills in broadcasting games, especially hoping to have the chance to broadcast my favorite basketball events and to report on the Olympic Games." Li Yi-Han has a clear goal, and when she talks about it, her eyes sparkle as if she is about to take a shot and score a bullseye. In the cold and wet December, let ANGO's hat T-shirt warm your heart.
