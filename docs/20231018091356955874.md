The Golden State Warriors hosted their first preseason game today against the Los Angeles Lakers, whom they faced in the playoffs last season. With the exception of Draymond Green, who was still recovering from an ankle injury, all players took turns on the court. This included new teammate Chris Paul, who made his debut in a Warriors uniform and scored 6 points, 5 assists, and 4 rebounds.

The Lakers, on the other hand, did not have LeBron James on the court, as he stated earlier that he would not be playing against the Warriors. The rest of the team played for about a quarter, with Anthony Davis, D'Angelo Russell, and Max Christie each scoring 15 points. New teammates Gabe Vincent, Christian Wood, and Cam Reddish also made appearances, but ultimately lost the game. The standout player for the Warriors was third-year player Jonathan Kuminga, who scored a team-high 24 points, along with 8 rebounds and 4 assists. He also made 4 out of 8 three-point attempts. During the game, there was a funny incident where Stephen Curry passed the ball to a wide-open player, but it turned out that Curry was actually standing out of bounds, resulting in a turnover to the Lakers. Curry could only laugh awkwardly with teammate Paul on the sidelines. Here are the highlights from the game:
