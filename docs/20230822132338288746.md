  HBO's Lakers drama "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty" Season 2 premiered

The series is adapted from journalist Jeff Pearlman's "Showtime" drama series. The first season depicted the rise of the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s, led by the flamboyant and charismatic owner Jerry Buss (played by John C. Reilly). The team was known for their entertaining style of play and was nicknamed Showtime.

However, the series also portrayed the darker aspects of the glamorous era - sex, drugs - which led some of the real-life characters to publicly criticize the show for distorting reality.

Continuing reading, how many key characters are there in the series? This includes Magic Johnson (played by Quincy Isaiah), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (played by Solomon Hughes), and coach West (played by Jason Clarke).

Coach West even publicly demanded an apology from HBO for the distorted portrayal of his character. In the series, Magic Johnson is still portrayed as a talented and spiritual player, but much attention is given to his rampant sexuality and affairs with different women. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, still in his prime, is depicted as a washed-up, jealous, and difficult former star. As for coach West, he is constantly smashing things and using foul language, showing no signs of stability or composure. 

The second season of the Lakers dynasty's rise in the TV series trailer enters the period after Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar led the team to win the 1980 NBA championship, forming a dynasty with a new style of play and a fast-paced dominance in the NBA league. The Showtime Lakers went on to win five championships, helping the NBA grow into a multi-billion dollar sports industry.

Continuing reading, the second season covers the period from 1980 to 1984, where the Lakers won their first championship but then faced elimination. The series explores what happens after achieving ambitions, especially why it becomes so difficult to win again after the first time. Max Borenstein says, "You will find that those who achieve their goals will stand in front of the mirror, doubting themselves, and wondering what to do next. What is the next step?" From 1982 onwards, the Lakers reached the NBA Finals eight out of ten years, which was an incredible era.

However, behind the ups and downs of their performance, there are stories. In 1982, the Lakers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers led by Julius Erving, only to be swept by their old rivals in 1983.

In 1984, the Lakers finally faced the Boston Celtics and Larry Bird (played by Sean Patrick Small) in the NBA Finals. To create dramatic storytelling, the script may not fully adhere to the actual events. Making a basketball-themed drama believable also requires a lot of effort. Producer Idan Ravin has helped with the basketball-related preparations in the past, including casting and choreography.

The challenge is that not many actors have the same height and athleticism as NBA players, making it difficult for them to perform high-level moves.

That's why when Idan Ravin received a call from HBO's production unit asking him to "turn a professional actor into Magic Johnson," he burst out laughing.

Idan Ravin said, "The NBA has 400 registered players today, and none of them can become Magic Johnson, but HBO wants me to train an actor to become Magic Johnson?" Continuing reading, Quincy Isaiah, who is 6 feet 3 inches tall, already stands out in Hollywood, but he is still 6 inches shorter than Magic Johnson. Additionally, his muscular physique from playing American football makes him look bulky on camera. Therefore, Idan Ravin helped him develop a weight loss plan to make his appearance closer to Magic Johnson. To make his basketball playing look professional, Idan Ravin had Quincy Isaiah undergo special training, especially in learning Magic Johnson's famous no-look passes, accurately bouncing the ball to his teammates.

Executive producer and one of the writers, Rodney Barnes, said that the challenge was to present how Johnson's interactions with his teammates were dramatic, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the storyline. In the second season, Pat Riley (played by Adrien Brody) officially becomes the Lakers' head coach after his friend West is fired. This is described by Max Borenstein as a "Shakespearean" transformation, as if a superhero emerges, with Pat Riley's Armani suits symbolizing a cape and his hair styled with gel symbolizing a mask, coming to the rescue of the Lakers. Another key character in the series is Jeanie Buss (played by Hadley Robinson), Jerry Buss's daughter and the current owner of the Lakers.

In reality, Jeanie Buss herself expressed her opinion on Instagram after the first season, stating that the portrayal in the series did not reflect her real life, but she commended the overall effect of the first season.

Max Borenstein said he had a positive conversation with Jeanie Buss, and the atmosphere was pleasant.

Rodney Barnes said, "We are not simply making things up. Sometimes it's hard to accept that your favorite character has another side to their life, so you may consider it fake or a wrong depiction."

To address this, the producers made preparations for the second season. They prepared a guide for journalists and the media, explaining the sources used in the series, including scenes from the third episode's awkward brunch and a crazy press conference scene in the fifth episode, which are based on real events. Are you a Lakers fan? Maybe you should go and watch this different portrayal of the Lakers' story. Further reading: HBO's retro sports drama - "Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty".
