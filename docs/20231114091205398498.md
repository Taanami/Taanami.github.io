 NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo showed up in a Hulk costume for the Halloween event after the game. He also participated in the post-game press conference, where he removed his costume and spoke in his normal voice. He even imitated the Hulk's voice and encouraged the reporters to ask him questions. Antetokounmpo scored 33 points and grabbed 7 rebounds, along with teammate Damian Lillard's 58 points, leading their team to victory against the Miami Heat, who had defeated them in last season's playoffs.
