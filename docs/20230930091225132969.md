 The NBA rest policy, which was proposed earlier this week, was officially approved by the NBA Board of Directors and is set to take effect in the 2023-24 season. This policy will apply to 48 players, who are not allowed to miss regular-season games without a valid reason.

The NBA rest policy focuses on five main directions. Firstly, teams with multiple star players cannot rest them simultaneously. Secondly, teams with star players are required to have them play in important games such as midseason invitationals and national broadcasts, provided they are not dealing with significant injuries. Additionally, players must have played in at least 65 games to be eligible for individual awards. The list of players affected by this policy, as defined by ESPN reporter Bobby Marks, includes those who have been selected to the All-Star Game and All-NBA Team in the past three years.

It is estimated that 48 players will be affected by this policy. Furthermore, according to Marks, if a player is selected as an All-Star during the season, regardless of whether it is their first selection or after a three-year gap, they will also be included in the list. Marks provided the example of Tyrese Maxey from the Philadelphia 76ers. If he is selected as an All-Star for the first time in February next year, he will be included in the list and will be subject to the rest policy for subsequent games. However, popular rookie Victor Wembanyama, who has no NBA playing record, would not be subject to the rest policy unless he is selected as an All-Star in his rookie season. Marks also mentioned that there are no restrictions on the number of games played for Rookie of the Year and All-Rookie First and Second Teams selections.
