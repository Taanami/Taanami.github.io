Former NBA star Jeremy Lin recently announced his shocking move to the P.League+ (PLG) team New Taipei Kings. The team held a grand signing ceremony for him on the 19th, where he met with the media for the first time. General Manager Mao Chia-en announced that the contract is a "1+1" year deal, jokingly hoping for a lifetime contract, showing the Kings' satisfaction with this signing.

However, in his first season in Taiwan, he chose to join the Kaohsiung Steelers, leading to several "brotherly showdowns" that generated a lot of buzz. Even their mother, Shirley Wu, wore a custom-made jersey combining the Kings and the Steelers to witness the rare competition between her two beloved sons. Just one year later, the "Lin Brothers" have come together, and Jeremy Lin expressed, "I can't really put into words how I feel right now. We've been talking about this for 30 years. It's a bit shocking, but I'm definitely very happy at this moment."

The Kings have already started their training camp today, and Jeremy Lin revealed that during training, he can always see his brother, Jeremy Lin Wei, which feels very strange. Team leader Chen Hsin-sheng also expressed the miraculous fate, saying, "The first time I saw him was on February 4, 2012, in the game at Madison Square Garden. I never thought we would have the opportunity to work together. It's truly unbelievable."

"Jeremy Lin values family, so it was actually his decision with his family. I didn't do much," Chen Hsin-sheng joked.

Please continue reading... In the past season, Jeremy Lin played 19 games for the Steelers, averaging 26.3 points, 8.5 rebounds, 8.9 assists, and 1.8 steals. He led the team to an 8-game winning streak at the end of the season but unfortunately lost the final game by 3 points to the Taiwan Beer Dreamers, leaving regrets. He revealed today that this offseason is the most active he has been as a free agent in his life. Joining the PLG in their first season, the Kings made it to the playoffs, and they had a chance to contend for the championship last season. Jeremy Lin's addition will further strengthen an already complete roster. Although the specific role has yet to be determined through discussions with the coaching staff, he is already looking forward to his mission in the upcoming season.

Jeremy Lin already has a clear vision for the Kings, saying, "I think I need to be a good leader. As a point guard, I need to unite the whole team and ensure that every player's thoughts on offense and defense are aligned, especially in this team."

He has already mentioned foreign players and Taiwanese player Li Kai-yen and is looking forward to working with them. "Li Kai-yen is a very capable local player, and I believe he hasn't reached his full potential yet." General Manager Mao Chia-en explained during the press conference that Jeremy Lin signed a "1+1" contract, with the second year being a player option. He jokingly expressed his hope for a "1+10" contract, saying, "I hope that his performance in a Kings jersey can be seen not only in Asia but also worldwide."
