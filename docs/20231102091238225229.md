The Spurs' top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama, scored 23 points on 10-of-15 shooting, along with 4 rebounds and 3 blocks in just 23 minutes. He had an impressive field goal percentage of 66.7%, leading the Spurs to a 120-104 victory over the Heat. During the post-game interview, reporter Stephanie Ready asked Wembanyama about his teammates' reactions to his performance, to which he replied, "My Spurs teammates told her that sometimes they are surprised by what I do in training, and I am grateful for their support." After the game, Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich was interviewed and asked about Wembanyama's weaknesses. He responded, "What weaknesses?" When the reporter clarified, "What are his weaknesses?" Popovich replied, "I don't talk about my players' weaknesses!"
