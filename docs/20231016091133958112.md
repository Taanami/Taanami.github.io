  Bringing Back Important Memories of the 2023 World Cup: Reunion of Thunder Assistant Coach Chip Engelland and the Philippines

38 years ago, Arthur 'Chip' Engelland played his last official game in the Philippines. Since then, he has only returned once, but in a way, he never really left. 

Engelland is now the shooting coach for the USA team in this year's World Cup. He is not surprised to see fans recognizing him on the sidelines, as he has experienced being approached by Filipino-Americans for photos even in the US. "If that happens in the US, I can only imagine how many people would recognize me in the Philippines," he says.

"I haven't played on a court in almost 40 years, yet I can still be recognized in the US. Filipino fans are truly amazing. I've met some passionate fans in Las Vegas and we sat down to chat, talking about the PBA and our beloved country," Engelland shares. This also shows the lasting impact he has left in the Filipino basketball community. 

Engelland is arguably the best pure shooter in the history of the PBA. After graduating from Duke University, he played in 76 games and averaged 27.5 points per game, with a record high of 60 points. He was also known as the "Machine Gun" for his precise shooting. 

Engelland was also a member of the famous Northern Consolidated Corporation (NCC) in the 1980s. NCC was a team formed by Eduardo "Danding" Cojuangco, who was appointed by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos as the director of the national team. The team was put together to represent the Philippines in international competitions. 

After training together for a few months, NCC, essentially a club team not affiliated with any league, had four naturalized players, including Engelland. They helped the Philippines secure a fourth-place finish in the 1982 Asian Games and won the 1985 Asian Championship in Kuala Lumpur, earning them a spot in the 1986 FIBA World Cup in Spain. 

In 1985, NCC also won the William Jones Cup, with Engelland scoring 43 points against the Purdue University team representing the US. "Without Jeff Moore and Dennis Still, we wouldn't have won the Jones Cup," he says. "We were a well-rounded team with great chemistry, and we still keep in touch." These achievements are still celebrated by Filipinos and Filipino-Americans, as basketball is the national sport of the Philippines. "Our performance in international competitions showcased our basketball prowess to many fans," Engelland adds. 

After the end of NCC in 1986, Engelland returned to the US and played in minor leagues before retiring and transitioning to a shooting coach. He held camps and worked as a private training consultant for players, earning him the nickname "The Shooting Doctor." Current US team head coach Steve Kerr and general manager Grant Hill were once his clients. In the 1999-2000 season, Engelland joined the Detroit Pistons as a shooting coach assistant, and three years later, he became the director of player development for the Denver Nuggets. He then spent 17 years with the San Antonio Spurs as an assistant coach, helping them win two championships. Players like Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, and Dejounte Murray all broke through their ceilings under his guidance and are now considered some of the best in the NBA. 

Kerr had been trying to recruit Engelland as a shooting coach for the Golden State Warriors, but their collaboration finally happened in the national team. Engelland is now a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder, tasked with developing talented young players like Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams, as well as current Canadian and Australian national team players, and Thunder's rising stars Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey. Giddey has praised Engelland's coaching, saying, "I train with him 2-3 times a day almost every day since he joined us. He's a genius." Engelland also mentions his two proteges, saying, "With SGA and Josh, Canada and Australia will definitely be tough opponents for us. They have already proven themselves in the NBA." 

Engelland last visited the Philippines 17 years ago, but only for a few days. Now, he is trying to reacquaint himself with the city he once called home. "I can't recognize many places anymore. I can still recognize some people and things, but I had to find new landmarks to move around. But I'm enjoying my stay here," he shares. Due to a busy schedule, he hasn't had much chance to watch the current Philippine national team play, but he knows they have a lot of promising young players. "I know they have a lot of young players, and I know they are consciously training them. Many of these young players have received training in the US, and I hope they continue this trend and bring more surprises for Philippine basketball," he says. 

This World Cup is an important milestone for the Philippine team, and Engelland also mentions their future. "I know they have a lot of young players. They are training them well, and many of these players have been trained in the US. I hope they can keep up the good work and continue to bring pride to Philippine basketball."
