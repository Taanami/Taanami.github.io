  Greenblood Ubon Trade: It's Time for a Holiday

The trade between the Celtics and the Blazers has brought about significant changes for the Celtics. Let's take a closer look at the details of the trade:

Celtics Receive: Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams III, 2024 Warriors First Round Pick (acquired through the KP trade), 2029 Celtics First Round Pick (unprotected)

Blazers Receive: Jrue Holiday

Team Roster and Salary:

After the trade and the signing of Gabriel, the team's salary has exceeded the Super-Tax Apron. However, some restrictions and penalties will not be implemented until next year, so it all depends on how much the owner is willing to pay for luxury tax. The Celtics now have four starting players with contracts worth over $30 million, but their bench depth has significantly decreased compared to last year.

Team Salary:
1. Jrue Holiday - $36,861,707
2. Kristaps Porzingis - $36,016,200
3. Jayson Tatum - $32,600,060
4. Jaylen Brown - $31,830,357
5. Derrick White - $18,357,143
6. Al Horford - $10,000,000
7. Payton Pritchard - $4,037,278
8. Luke Kornet - $2,413,304 (non-guaranteed)
9. Oshae Brissett - $2,165,000
10. Svi Mykhailiuk - $2,019,706 (non-guaranteed)
11. Dalano Banton - $2,019,706 (non-guaranteed)
12. Sam Hauser - $1,927,896
13. Jordan Walsh - $1,119,563

Total salary of the above 13 players: $181,367,920
2023 Super-Tax Apron: $182,794,000

With only a $1.4 million difference from the Super-Tax Apron, there is not even enough space for a minimum salary player. Unless the team can make another trade to reduce their salary, they are likely to exceed the Super-Tax Apron. This is also the reason why this trade does not seem like a move made by Brad Stevens. Based on the owner Wyc's past decisions, it is unlikely that he will give the green light for such a risky move. The window for winning a championship is fleeting, but taking such a big risk is not worth it. From the contract extension of Brown to the KP trade, I thought the team was willing to make changes while also considering the team's depth. Is this trade really just a reaction to the Bucks' strengthening? It's worth thinking about.

Team Roster:

A team can have up to 20 players in training camp. With 13 players on the official roster and three two-way contracts, the remaining four spots will likely be filled by players on training camp contracts. The team has already signed three players for training camp: L. Stevens, W. Gabriel, and K. Kelley. The first two have Exhibit 9 contracts, and the latter has an Exhibit 10 contract. It is expected that the remaining spots will be filled by one of these three players.

The training camp has already begun, so it's unlikely that the team will sign any more players. To maintain flexibility, they may only fill one of the remaining two spots. Originally, I would have chosen Stevens without hesitation, but now with a gap in the frontcourt, Gabriel may have an advantage. However, I don't believe he will have a significant impact on defense in the frontcourt. I would rather trust Kornet's abilities.

Impact of M. Brogdon and R. Williams III leaving:

Brogdon won the Sixth Man of the Year award last year and is indeed an efficient scorer. He provides stability and always makes the right decisions off the bench, which is crucial. However, his performance in organizing the offense is not as good as others expected. Of course, it's not entirely his fault. He is capable of handling the ball and organizing the offense through pick-and-rolls, but it's not the Celtics' primary strategy and not the most efficient one.

To me, Brogdon is better at driving to the basket and shooting threes. His speed and finishing ability are top-notch, and his three-point shooting is at a high level. Given his position and salary, we can't ask for more from him, but he won't be the one to take over in crucial moments and lead the team to victory.

As for Williams III, this is the key reason why I disagree with this trade. First, he has an average salary of only $12 million for the next three years, so he's not a salary cap burden. Second, he finally established himself last year, and despite his meniscus surgery, he still had a significant impact on defense in the frontcourt. Not to mention his playmaking and potential for outside shooting. I don't believe his injury is the reason why the team decided to trade him so early. Especially with the arrival of Porzingis, it's clear that Horford will take a back seat, and Williams III won't have to carry the load of a center. Now, with Horford gone, there is no one else who can take on that role.

In conclusion, I don't think this was a fair trade, but we must continue to support our team and hope for another successful season ahead!
