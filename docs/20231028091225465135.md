 202324 Season Preview: Miami Heat

The Damian Lillard trade rumors dominated the summer, but eventually, the Miami Heat ended up not being involved. However, Tyler Herro, a key player in the team's 2023-24 season, still had to deal with the constant trade talks and uncertainty.

Losing out on Lillard wasn't the only setback for the Heat, as defensive stalwart Jrue Holiday quickly joined the Celtics, and the starting backcourt from last season's championship run both left the team. This is not a promising start for the Heat.

Introduction: The Heat had a completely different performance in the regular season compared to the playoffs last season. With only 44 wins, they ranked seventh in the East, and losing their first game in the play-in tournament to the Hawks could have meant the end of their season.

But the team's momentum completely changed in the first game against the Bulls, and they managed to defeat the No. 1 seed Bucks in five games, thanks to Jimmy Butler's heroic performance and Giannis Antetokounmpo's injury.

They went on to defeat the fifth-seeded New York Knicks in six games and pushed the Celtics to the brink of elimination with three consecutive wins in the Eastern Conference Finals, but ultimately lost three straight games and had to win Game 7 on the road to advance to the NBA Finals.

In the Finals, they faced a strong and complete Denver Nuggets team, and the size, talent, and skill gap between the two teams were evident. The team's ace, Butler, also seemed to have run out of gas and couldn't match his performance from the previous rounds. Even though center Bam Adebayo put in a great effort to guard Nikola Jokic and had his best playoff performance, it wasn't enough as the Heat lost in five games and missed out on the championship.

Looking ahead, as long as the godfather, Pat Riley, is still at the helm, the Heat will always be a competitive team. And with current star player Butler constantly proving his determination and fighting spirit, along with the guidance of the league's best coach, Erik Spoelstra, the team will remain a force to be reckoned with, even if their offseason trades and additions may not be as successful as they hope.

Offseason Changes: In: Nikola Jović, Jaime Jaquez Jr., Out: Josh Richardson, Gabe Vincent, Max Strus, Thomas Bryant, Cody Zeller, R.J. Hampton, Omer Yurtseven

Key Focus for the Season: Continuously finding ways to improve and reach the team's full potential, making moves in the trade market, and relying on Adebayo and Butler as the team's foundation to maintain competitiveness. It is crucial for young players to prove their worth and provide valuable contributions (or become valuable trade assets). Keep an eye on 20-year-old Serbian forward Nikola Jović and first-round pick Jaime Jaquez Jr. (JJJ).

At 6'10", Jović was a starter for the Serbian national team in their journey to the FIBA World Cup finals, playing almost 24 minutes per game. His standout performance was against South Sudan, where he had 25 points, 2 rebounds, 3 assists, and 0 turnovers, shooting 4-4 from two-point range and 5-5 from three-point range, but unfortunately missing one free throw.

His performance declined significantly in the more intense rounds of the tournament, only shooting 1-6 against Italy and 4-14 against the Dominican Republic, but he still showed solid passing skills. However, it remains to be seen if he can replicate this performance in the NBA. At the NBA level, Jović may still be a bit too skinny and lacks athleticism. However, he has a good height and ball-handling abilities, along with a smooth shooting stroke, reminding some of former Turkish forward Hedo Türkoğlu.

It's not common for the Heat to choose international players, making Jović's selection a rare occurrence. He has a strong competitive spirit and, like many European players, started his professional career early. In 2021, he was selected to the FIBA U19 World Cup Best Five (along with Spurs' No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama, Thunder's forward Chet Holmgren, and Pistons' guard Jaden Ivey). Jović is still a work in progress, as he has shown good decision-making and intelligence on the court, but needs to accumulate experience with the ball in his hands and improve his defense. He may not have the right environment to develop these skills with the Heat, so he may need to start from the basics and work on his off-ball movement and defense to earn consistent playing time. He has the highest potential among the Heat's young players, and once he fully develops, he can solve Adebayo's lack of range. However, it's highly possible that he may only reach his full potential on another team, similar to how Jokic became a complete player on the Nuggets.

Jaime Jaquez, a senior forward from UCLA, is a promising rookie who can provide immediate help. He has average height and athleticism for a forward, but stands out for his combination of footwork and post moves, often using his timing to confuse defenders.

His greatest strength in college was his ability to create scoring opportunities with the ball in his hands and not shying away from contact. His defense, shooting, and age caused him to fall in the draft, and he has been unlucky with injuries since joining the Heat. He injured his shoulder in two summer league games and missed most of training camp, only playing in one preseason game. It is expected that Jaquez will be able to contribute right away, but staying healthy should be his top priority.

Additionally, the Heat's biggest weakness this season is their three-point shooting, especially with their traditional power forwards and centers being primarily inside players. This is where JJJ's outside shooting abilities become crucial. He has expressed confidence in his shooting during the draft, and the Heat should give him opportunities to prove it.
