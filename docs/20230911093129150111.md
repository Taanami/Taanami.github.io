  NBA player Kai Jones causes a stir with his recent IG live stream, which has caught the attention of many fans. Jones, known for his extravagant green hairstyle, recorded himself incoherently speaking to the camera, leading to concerns about potential substance abuse. Some fans believe that Jones, in a disoriented state of mind, may end up in trouble similar to Ja Morant. However, Jones confidently stated, "If I get a call (to be traded), I'll just say bye, but I don't think that will happen." Many fans are urging the league to conduct a drug test on him tomorrow. If Jones has used marijuana, he may not face any consequences as the NBA has excluded it from its list of banned substances. However, if he has indeed engaged in drug abuse, he is likely to face suspension or fines. Kai Jones possesses incredible explosiveness. Photo/Reuters
