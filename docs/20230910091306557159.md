  Germany Defeats the United States, Setting the Stage for a Showdown with the World's Top Team in the 2023 World Cup

Shaking off the disappointment of their first loss in this tournament against Lithuania, the United States regained their defensive intensity in the quarterfinals to completely suppress Italy's offense in the 2023 World Cup. The American defense was solid and impenetrable, delivering a heavy blow to Italy and securing a spot in the semifinals. Their next opponent will be Germany, a team that has given the United States trouble in their warm-up match.

In the warm-up match, the United States found themselves trailing by as much as 16 points, unable to contain Germany's offensive onslaught in the first three quarters. It was only in the final quarter, with increased defensive pressure and the explosive performances of Anthony Edwards, Austin Reaves, and Tyrese Haliburton from beyond the arc, that the United States managed to surpass Germany in the score. This demonstrated that Germany had a solid and well-coordinated team chemistry before the start of the tournament.

Germany is the only undefeated team in this World Cup and has showcased a formidable defense. While offensive efficiency has been high for all teams in this tournament, Germany's defense has been exceptionally stable. Their highest conceded points in a game was 82 against Australia, and they have held all other opponents to scores below 80. Their attacking style is characterized by few mistakes, averaging only 10.2 turnovers per game, which is the second-lowest among the four semifinal teams, surpassed only by Serbia's 9.5 turnovers.

The primary ball-handler for Germany in the FIBA system is Dennis Schröder, who possesses different levels of efficiency in driving, mid-range shooting, and three-point shooting, except for the previous game against Latvia. The Wagner brothers, Moritz and Franz, who play for the Orlando Magic, are crucial pillars in the frontcourt, contributing to rebounding, defense, and overall agility. Franz, in particular, with his tall stature and ability to handle the ball, provides versatility and stability to the team. His return from injury against Latvia after a four-game absence proved to be a significant boost.

In addition to the typical high pick-and-roll and Spain's screen-and-roll tactics, Germany's offensive system emphasizes player movement and clear off-ball screens to create better opportunities. Apart from Schröder, multiple players can contribute to playmaking and quick ball movement, resulting in a well-balanced distribution of scoring among the main players.

Isaac Bonga, standing at 6'8", is an excellent perimeter defender, while Milan guard Maodo Lo and Bayern Munich guard Andreas Obst boast a three-point shooting percentage close to 45%, providing significant outside scoring.

Johannes Voigtmann, a 6'11" center, is the main force in the middle, possessing shooting range despite average athleticism and rebounding. He, along with NBA caliber center Daniel Theis, forms a formidable defensive presence in the paint.

Although Germany has four players with NBA experience (the Wagner brothers, Theis, and Schröder), they do not solely rely on them. In the game against Latvia, Germany utilized a nine-man rotation, with only Schröder playing exactly 30 minutes. Other players did not exceed 25 minutes, demonstrating ideal energy management. Apart from guards David Kramer, forward Niels Giffey, and emerging point guard Justus Hollatz, who have seen less playing time, the rest of the team is capable and ready to contribute.

The United States' biggest challenge in this tournament has been their interior defense and rebounding. Germany's frontline consists of Voigtmann, the Wagner brothers, Johannes Thiemann at 6'9", and Isaac Bonga, who all possess considerable height. While not having exceptional rebounding specialists or the traditionally robust physique of Eastern European teams, the physicality of Theis, the agility of Bonga and the Wagner brothers, and the height of Voigtmann can pose significant challenges for the United States. Even without a heavyweight tank like Jonas Valanciunas, Germany will surely attempt to create problems for Jaren Jackson Jr. with foul trouble, the starting center for the United States (referred to as JJJ in the following text). Under the leadership of head coach Gordie Herbert, Germany has a well-established defensive and rebounding system, boasting a defensive rebounding rate of 77.3%, the highest in the tournament. They have limited opponents to only 8 offensive rebounds per game, ranking second in the tournament, making it difficult for the United States to have an advantage in offensive rebounding.

For Germany, the defense in transition after attacking is crucial since the athleticism of the United States makes them the best fast-break team in the world. Counteracting the United States' strength, Germany must maintain a high level of intensity throughout the game, which is made more challenging by the extra day of rest the United States had due to their schedule. Franz Wagner emphasized the importance of team effort in an interview before the semifinals, stating that individual standout performances alone would not be enough. He mentioned that the whole team must compete actively together, and once achieved, they can defeat any opponent. While it may sound cliché, this is the key to winning. Germany does not have a superstar like Luka Doncic or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander who can single-handedly carry the team; therefore, they heavily rely on teamwork.

The evidence of Lithuania's victory over the United States is also noteworthy. No player on the Lithuanian team scored more than 15 points, but seven players reached double-digit scoring, and two others contributed 9 points, with a total of nine players making three-pointers. Rebounding was also a collective effort, with seven players grabbing offensive rebounds. By firing on all cylinders and exerting maximum effort, Lithuania secured the final victory, capitalizing on their physical advantages.
