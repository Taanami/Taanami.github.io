 NBA player Miles Bridges has been arrested again for violating a previous restraining order, according to reports from Charlotte media yesterday. Today's report also revealed that he used a basketball to smash the windshield of a car with children inside and has been charged with child abuse. This incident occurred with his ex-girlfriend, who they have multiple children with, and they are currently in a custody dispute.

Bridges was also reported to have threatened to withhold child support and told his ex-girlfriend, "I'm going to take everything away from him." It was also noted in the report that Bridges had a similar incident in January of this year, where an arrest warrant was issued but was not able to be delivered in time and details of the incident are unclear. However, the police have confirmed that this recent crime is related to the incident in January. Bridges was sentenced to three years probation and must adhere to a ten-year criminal restraining order against the victim. He was allowed to return to the court in July and signed a one-year, $7.9 million contract with the Hornets during the summer, but he will have to serve a 10-game suspension before he can continue playing this season.
