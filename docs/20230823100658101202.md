 The "Peak Essays" are both overrated and underrated, whether it's the US team or the Lakers, Austin Reaves is a versatile Swiss army knife.

The mountains are towering and majestic.

The main discussion revolves around interesting topics or players, occasionally commenting on current events. In late March 2023, when the Lakers were still seeking a playoff spot, I wrote an essay called "Peak Essays" about the rise and excellent performance of Austin Reaves, a white shooting guard known as AR15. Please continue reading. Reaves has been in the spotlight in Los Angeles, playing for the prestigious Lakers, and news and various comments about him have never stopped.

In an anonymous NBA player poll before the end of the season, Reaves was selected as one of the most overrated and underrated players.

His career started with going undrafted, which made him underrated (although later it was proven that it was deliberately planned by Reaves' camp). In his second season, he became a key player for the Lakers, which may have led to him being overrated (perhaps due to his skin color), leaving Reaves' true value and abilities shrouded in mystery. Former NBA player Rashad McCants said on a podcast that Reaves was overhyped simply because he is a white player on the Lakers and happened to rise up when the Lakers had many injured players. Who is McCants? He is a notable figure in college basketball, a scoring guard with explosive athleticism, and a product of the prestigious University of North Carolina, where he won a championship and was selected 14th overall by the Timberwolves in 2005.

However, limited by his playing style and physique, McCants is a glaring example of a college scoring guard who failed to transition successfully.

After his four-year rookie contract expired, he couldn't secure a second contract and couldn't make a name for himself in Europe either. He could only play in weaker leagues, and his professional career had nothing noteworthy. It's reasonable to say that McCants is bitter about not being able to taste the grapes, especially considering that Reaves has indeed received more opportunities.

However, opportunities must be seized in order to make an impact. Otherwise, the Linsanity phenomenon wouldn't have been so precious. Please continue reading. Is Reaves overrated or underrated? Judging from his performance in the latter part of the season and throughout the playoffs, I personally believe that Reaves is without a doubt the real deal, at least a qualified starter. At just 25 years old, he still has room for improvement.

If we say that regular season performance has limited reference value, then what about the intensity of the playoffs? Reaves' performance in the play-in tournament was average, but he shone brighter in the playoffs.

In his first-ever playoff journey, Reaves started in all 16 games, playing over 36 minutes per game and averaging 17 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 4.6 assists with only 1.6 turnovers per game.

His performance dipped in the second round, but he bounced back strongly in the Western Conference Finals, averaging over 20 points per game with an impressive shooting percentage, solidifying his role as the Lakers' third option after LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

After the season ended, he was selected to represent the national team in the Basketball World Cup, continuing to write a remarkable chapter. Steve Kerr, coach of the USA national team and also the coach of the Golden State Warriors, the Lakers' opponent in the second round, said, "Based on Reaves' performance in the Western Conference playoffs, it's an easy decision to choose him." International games value physicality, shooting, and on-court decision-making abilities. They hope that the primary ball handler can also possess the skills of shooting, cutting, and passing, as well as the ability to defend multiple positions without being exploited.

Reaves possesses all these abilities and has a high understanding of the game, making his selection for the national team not accidental. Former Lakers teammate, now playing for the Philadelphia 76ers, Patrick Beverley, praised Reaves on his personal podcast, saying, "What makes Reaves impressive is his basketball IQ, but he has been underestimated because of his appearance. From my experience playing with him, Reaves has a great understanding of the game, which is why he frequently gets to the free-throw line."

In the NBA, there are two types of players who can get to the free-throw line in large numbers. One is those who possess incredible athleticism and physicality to dunk over opponents, and the other is those who are extremely smart.

It's obvious that Reaves belongs to the second category. Reaves' abilities are well recognized by those in the basketball community, but due to his status as a restricted free agent, he didn't receive much interest in the market. With only two years of experience, he had no salary cap space to work with on the Lakers, so he had to settle for an early bird exception contract, signing a 4-year, $56 million contract with a player option in the fourth year, along with a 15% trade kicker. This contract is clearly lower than his market value, considering that Jordan Poole, who has a slightly stronger offensive firepower but weaker organization and defense, signed a 4-year, $128 million contract, and Miami Heat guard Tyler Herro signed a 4-year, $120 million contract, making Reaves' contract a steal for the Lakers. In recent years, NBA salaries have risen rapidly, and a young, high-quality starter is expected to earn at least $20 million per year, so Reaves' salary falls below his production. Whether it's with the Lakers or in the upcoming World Cup, Reaves plays a similar role.

Offensively, he mainly serves as a playmaker, occasionally initiating pick-and-rolls, and can make quick decisions when time is running out. He can switch between on-ball and off-ball roles, has a low turnover rate, and poses a threat from the perimeter. Defensively, Reaves is willing to fight and compete, making him a valuable asset for coaches. In preseason games, there were scenes where three guards were on the court at the same time. When Reaves first entered the league, he earned playing time through his defense, fearlessly guarding top guards like Ja Morant and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He also received praise from his fellow Lakers alum and defensive stalwart, Alex Caruso, who went from being undrafted to earning a big contract. In the recent playoff journey, Reaves didn't neglect his defense, especially when he chased after the Warriors' Splash Brothers in the second round, and even his shooting was affected in the later stages of the series.
