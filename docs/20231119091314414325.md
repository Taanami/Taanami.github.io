 Recently, Eric Gordon, who joined the Suns this summer, was interviewed by Mark Medina from "Sportskeeda".

In the interview, Gordon talked about whether Klay Thompson is willing to play for the Bahamas. He said that Klay understands how meaningful it would be to play for the Bahamas in the Olympics. When asked by reporter Mark Medina, "Mychal Thompson (Klay Thompson's father) told me that he's not sure if Klay will play for the US team or the Bahamas team, will you try to convince Klay to play for the Bahamas team?" Gordon chuckled and said, "We'll see, he knows he has to make a tough decision, both options are possible, but I'll keep my hopes up." Reporter Mark Medina continued, "What's your take on this, or is it still too early to talk about it?" Gordon responded, "It's still too early, we don't know yet, but he knows our direction, and I think he understands how meaningful it would be."
