 It is time to establish a high school student basketball league.

In this ever-changing era, the trends and culture of sports continue to evolve and adjust. However, the high school basketball league system in Taiwan has remained stagnant, sacrificing the basketball dreams of students.

The high school basketball league has been around for over 30 years, and although the format has been slightly adjusted over time, it is still outdated in today's rapidly changing social environment. With issues such as declining birth rates and unequal resource distribution, the high school league system needs a major reform. As seen in the recently concluded HBL qualification games, out of 27 teams participating, 19 were eliminated within a week. This means that nearly 300 students have already ended their season before it even began. Clearly, there is a need for more adjustments in the league format. Furthermore, the narrow qualification criteria for entering the HBL results in unequal distribution of player resources and benefits for those who come out on top.

In addition, the limited number of HBL qualification tickets available puts immense pressure on schools to sacrifice their students' academic rights. This includes cutting class time, constant games and training, and even disregarding official regulations for student leave. This creates a vicious cycle of the strong getting stronger and the weak getting weaker.

The high school basketball league is marketed as a league, but in reality, it is more like a cup tournament. The one-week schedule determines the outcome of three years of hard work for students. It is like a three-year exam that is decided in one week, putting immense pressure on students and coaches. This "win or go home" concept does not promote education. Moreover, the intense schedule of games within a week not only exhausts students physically and mentally, but also ignores the educational purpose behind sports.

The issue of foreign student players has also been a hot topic this year, highlighting the unclear responsibilities between the high school sports association and the sports administration. The lack of effective regulations for foreign student players with work visas coming to play in HBL shows that the high school sports association is not keeping up with the times, unlike the college sports association which has implemented regulations for foreign players.

The aforementioned issues are just the tip of the iceberg in the high school basketball league. There are many other problems that arise from the inability of the high school sports association to effectively adjust and reform the league format. As an organization responsible for promoting various sports in high schools, the high school sports association also has to handle other sports such as volleyball, softball, soccer, and dance competitions. However, due to the popularity of high school basketball, it is important for the association to focus on establishing a separate organization solely dedicated to organizing high school basketball competitions. This can help avoid overburdening the high school sports association and allow for more efficient changes and improvements in the league system. The organization can also involve more basketball professionals (such as teachers, coaches, or scholars) to provide their expertise and help integrate the league.

The establishment of a student basketball league does not aim to replace the current high school basketball league. Rather, it is necessary to have a strong competitor that can provide students with more opportunities to compete and improve their skills. It is not fair for students to only have one chance to compete in HBL in their entire high school career. What is even more tragic is the sacrifice of students' fundamental rights. We need a progressive organization that can continue to promote the development of grassroots basketball, instead of a top-down approach where the voices of grassroots coaches are not heard. It is time for the establishment of a student basketball league.
