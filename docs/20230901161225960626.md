  Wilson Scores 53 Points to Tie WNBA Single-Game Scoring Record

Wilson, a two-time MVP, set a new career high with 53 points this morning, leading the Las Vegas Aces to a 112-100 victory over the Atlanta Dream. This incredible performance not only marked Wilson's personal best in scoring for a single game but also tied Liz Cambage's record of the highest-scoring game in WNBA history, which she achieved in 2018 against the New York Liberty. Wilson becomes one of only three players in WNBA history to score over 50 points in a single game, joining Cambage with 53 points and Riquna Williams with 51 points. After the game, Aces head coach Becky Hammon spoke highly of Wilson, saying, "I don't know what kind of creature she is. She runs like a deer, jumps like a cat, and has hands like Spider-Man." 

Wilson's shooting was remarkable in this game, with an impressive field goal percentage of 70%, making 16 of her 23 attempts. She also had a hot hand from the free-throw line, making 20 of 21 attempts. This game set new career highs for Wilson in both free-throw attempts and field goals made.

In addition to her offensive performance, Wilson also stood out on the defensive end. She grabbed 7 rebounds and recorded 4 blocks in this game, bringing her total blocks for the season to 70, leading the entire league.

When Wilson guarded her opponents' shots today, the Dream's shooting percentage dropped to a mere 21%. Wilson has now scored a total of 735 points this season, surpassing her teammate Kelsey Plum's franchise record of 726 points in a single season set in 2022. Plum praised Wilson, saying, "We are witnessing a legendary talent. Wilson is one of the greatest players of all time, and she's just getting started."
