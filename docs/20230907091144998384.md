Cushioning, shock absorption, and durability: PUMA All-Pro Nitro high-end nitrogen basketball shoes.

For the first time, PUMA has incorporated NITRO nitrogen technology into basketball shoe design. In 2023, they will upgrade to NITRO™ SQD dual-density nitrogen midsole technology, emphasizing the all-around performance of the PUMA All-Pro Nitro high-end nitrogen basketball shoes. The shoes feature high-density nitrogen midsole layers on the inner and outer sides, providing complete support during lateral movements, while the low-density nitrogen midsole layer offers excellent rebound and cushioning. The engineered mesh upper provides multi-angle targeted support, creating a perfect balance of breathability and comfort. The high-durability rubber outsole, combined with special grooves, effectively increases traction on the ground, providing excellent support for quick stops, pull-up jump shots, and fadeaways. The upgraded CORD lacing system provides complete lateral stability, extending from the instep to the toe with different widths for targeted wrapping. This not only reduces the risk of loose laces during fast movements but also strengthens the stability in the midfoot area.
