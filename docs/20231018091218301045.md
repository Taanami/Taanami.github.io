It is not surprising that the Chinese team easily defeated Hong Kong in their first game of the Hangzhou Asian Games. The Chinese team had a double-digit lead in the first quarter, and although Hong Kong regained their composure in the second quarter, the Chinese team maintained a steady lead and eventually won by 19 points. The Chinese team's victory was not a small one, but it cannot be considered a beautiful one.

All five players on the team scored in double digits and the point differential was almost 20 points. On paper, the Chinese team's performance seemed impressive, but upon closer inspection, there are still many areas that need to be adjusted.

The limited vision of the Chinese team's point guard was unable to fully utilize their physical advantage. In this game, the Chinese team had a height advantage at every position, especially in the paint where they had four players taller than their Hong Kong counterparts. Hong Kong's starting center, Duncan Overbeck Reid, was only 205cm, while the Chinese team's center, William Joseph Artino, was 211cm. Furthermore, Hong Kong mostly used a "one big four small" lineup, giving the Chinese team a significant advantage in the paint.

However, the Chinese team did not fully capitalize on their height advantage. Hong Kong's defense was aggressive and quick to close in on the Chinese team's big men, making it difficult for them to score.

It is a pity that Artino's passing vision was not exceptional, and he failed to make timely passes when drawing double teams, missing opportunities to take advantage of Hong Kong's compact defense.

The performance of the Chinese team's big men may not have met expectations. Despite outscoring Hong Kong 16-12 in second-chance points, the Chinese team did not fully dominate the paint. Hong Kong's defense was effective in clogging the lane, making it difficult for the Chinese team to score inside.

It is also worth noting that the Chinese team's defense could use some improvement. Throughout the game, they used a man-to-man defense to create turnovers and score in transition. While this strategy did result in Hong Kong committing 23 turnovers, the Chinese team was not able to capitalize on these opportunities and only scored 15 points in transition.

However, the man-to-man defense had its drawbacks. By extending their defense to the three-point line, the Chinese team had to cover more ground, leaving more space for Hong Kong players to drive to the basket. This led to Hong Kong being able to score more easily.

In the second half, Hong Kong took advantage of their speed and quickness to attack the basket, utilizing cuts and passes to beat the Chinese team's defense. It was evident that the Chinese team's coaching staff failed to make necessary adjustments to their defense.

It is crucial for the coaching staff to be able to adapt to the game situation quickly. In previous games, such as the Jones Cup against Iran and the United States, the Chinese team's defense was not able to adjust to their opponents' strategies in a timely manner, resulting in them struggling to stop their opponents' scoring runs. This is an area that the coaching staff should pay attention to.

Although the Chinese team won convincingly against Hong Kong, it was apparent that they have not reached their full potential yet. For example, their three-point shooting was off in this game, only making 22.9% of their attempts, compared to 34.6% in the Jones Cup. The Chinese team must make the most of their remaining group stage games to continue to improve and advance to the quarter-finals.
