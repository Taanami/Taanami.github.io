  PLEAGUE Preseason in Keelung, Cross-League Games Coming Soon

While domestic basketball in Taiwan is in turmoil, the Chinese national team is preparing for the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games at the end of this month. The basketball scene in Taiwan has not stopped either. P.LEAGUE+ today announced the information regarding the 2023-24 season preseason games. The cross-league games that debuted last year will continue this year. Not only will the Taipei Fubon Braves, the newly joined team from the T1 League, participate, but also National Chengchi University, who recently completed a three-peat in the University Basketball Association (UBA). Taiwan basketball is very busy during this offseason. The recently concluded William Jones Cup, which resumed after a three-year hiatus, and the schedule for the Chengdu World University Games representative team have just been completed. However, the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in August, which our country was supposed to compete in, were eventually withdrawn due to the event being held in Damascus, Syria, which is classified as a travel red alert zone. The originally planned training camp, mainly consisting of T1 League players, has disbanded.

Chinese Blue is composed of current national team players and will also compete in the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games. In the later stages of the Jones Cup, the contract disputes between Lin Ping-Hsuan and the P.LEAGUE+ Hsinchu JLions and the T1 League Taipei Fubon Braves are still ongoing. This week, the JLions have filed a lawsuit, and both parties have decided to go to court. Furthermore, there have been negative reports about the former head coach of the Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology Basketball Team instructing an assistant to vandalize a car. Amongst all these news, it is clear that the offseason of Taiwan basketball has not come to a halt. (Image source: P.LEAGUE+)

Today, P.LEAGUE+ released a statement announcing the schedule for the 2023-24 season preseason games. Last year's preseason games were held at the Fengshan Gymnasium, home of the Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology Basketball Team. This year, the Jeoutai Technology Basketball Team remains the preseason partner of the league, but the games will be moved from the "Harbor City" to Keelung, also known as the "Rain City". The games will take place from October 7th to 9th, with a total of six matches, bringing professional basketball back to Keelung, where adult-level basketball games haven't been held for many years. The schedule for the P.LEAGUE+ 2023-24 season preseason games is as follows:
Venue    Date       Time       Match
Keelung Municipal Gymnasium
October 7th (Saturday)     14:30      Dreamers vs. JLions
                                                      17:00      Bank of Taiwan vs. Warriors
October 8th (Sunday)        14:30      JLions vs. Yulon Luxgen Dinos
                                                      17:00      Taiwan Beer vs. Dreamers
October 9th (Monday)      14:30      Yulon Luxgen Dinos vs. Warriors
                                                      17:00      Bank of Taiwan vs. Taiwan Beer

Please continue reading. During the previous offseason, P.LEAGUE+, T1 League, and the Super Basketball League (SBL) participated in the cross-league games together. In the end, the Taiwan Beer Bears from the T1 League defeated the Xinbei Citic Kaohsiung Braves to win the championship, successfully showcasing the three leagues/competitions competing and collaborating on the same court. Although each team has varying degrees of training purposes, the games are still highly anticipated. There have been reports that the cross-league games may continue after several international competitions, and seven teams have already confirmed their participation. The SBL will be represented by Taiwan Bank, Changhua Jets, and Taiwan Beer. P.LEAGUE+ will be represented by the Dreamers and Yulon Luxgen Dinos. The T1 League will have the Taipei Fubon Braves, who have been the talk of the town this offseason. Additionally, there will be a Chinese Asian Games training team and National Chengchi University from the UBA participating.

(Image source: Chinese Taipei Basketball Association) SBL teams that participated in the cross-league games last year also showed competitive performances. They will participate again this year. After generating so much buzz during the offseason, it will be interesting to see how the newly formed Taipei Fubon Braves perform in actual games and whether Lin Ping-Hsuan will take the court. As for National Chengchi University, which dominated the UBA for the past three seasons and is known as the "Political Universe," it will be intriguing to see if they can demonstrate their excellent skills against higher-level teams as they prepare for the new UBA season. This is undoubtedly a hot topic of discussion in various circles. [Editor: Zhang Zhengbang]
