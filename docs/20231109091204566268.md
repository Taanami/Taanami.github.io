On their last stop of the road trip, the Orlando Magic faced off against the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City. Thanks to Paolo Banchero's crucial drive and two-pointer in the final moments, the Magic were able to hold off a comeback attempt by Lauri Markkanen, who hit back-to-back three-pointers in the fourth quarter. However, the team also received some bad news as three key rotation players, Wendell Carter Jr., Markelle Fultz, and Gary Harris, all suffered injuries in Salt Lake City.

In the final minutes of the fourth quarter, Wendell Carter Jr. injured the metacarpal bone in his left middle finger while battling for a rebound. The team announced after the game that he had suffered a fracture and would need further evaluation in Orlando.

Harris also suffered a groin injury during the game, while Fultz experienced soreness in his left knee and did not play. Both players will also undergo further evaluation in Orlando to determine their recovery timeline.

Despite the injuries, the Magic were able to secure their second win in four games on their Western Conference road trip. Wendell Carter Jr. recorded his first double-double of the season with 14 points and 10 rebounds, while Harris, who started in place of Fultz, failed to score and only tallied one assist and one block.
