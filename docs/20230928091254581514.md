  The Life of Leonard, the New King of the Holy City Comes to an End

As negotiations cooled down between the Celtics, Lakers, 76ers, and other potential destinations for Kawhi Leonard, it seemed like the Spurs were losing their bargaining power. Just like how the Thunder unexpectedly acquired Paul George last year, this time it was another surprising destination that put an end to this highly anticipated drama.

Please continue reading below as the Raptors paid a hefty price to acquire their claw (The KLAW), while the Spurs achieved their desired offer by trading away a top-five player in the league and gaining a strong addition to the team that was selected for the All-NBA Second Team this season. This calculated risk-management move is worth reading about.

Since being swept by the Cavaliers and their head coach Dwane Casey getting fired, many analysts believed that the Raptors, who dominated the Eastern Conference this year, had reached their peak.

Despite LeBron James' "journey to the West," the rise of the 76ers and Celtics, and the Bucks and Pacers led by Antetokounmpo and Oladipo lurking in the sidelines, the Raptors, with their core entering their prime, seemed to lack future prospects compared to other competitive teams. After spending big money to re-sign Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka last year, they had locked themselves out of any future free agent signings for the next two years. For Raptors General Manager Masai Ujiri, there was no better opportunity than acquiring Kawhi Leonard, a former top-five player in the league, back-to-back MVP, and a candidate for Defensive Player of the Year just a year ago.

If next summer, Kyle Lowry's enthusiasm and the $50 million gap can successfully convince Leonard to re-sign, his age and dominant offensive and defensive skills would undoubtedly allow the Raptors to compete against the Eastern Conference powerhouses. On the other hand, if Leonard remains determined to leave, along with Danny Green's expiring contract, the Raptors can create a salary cap space of $30 million and sell players like Lowry and Ibaka to teams with significant cap space but lacking in reinforcements, allowing them to enter a rebuilding phase ahead of schedule. Similar to last year's Thunder trading for Paul George with Victor Oladipo as the centerpiece, this trade has its gambling elements but is also reasonable.

Let's not forget how Kawhi Leonard led the Spurs to the Western Conference Finals on his own just a year ago. Perhaps some may worry that Leonard will follow the pattern of Vince Carter seeking a trade and not giving his best effort. I believe this is an unnecessary concern. With an abundance of talent in the upcoming free agency market next year, if Leonard doesn't perform as expected and his future with the Raptors becomes uncertain due to either retaining his abilities or health issues, there are frontline players such as Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, and Kemba Walker waiting in line. The two Los Angeles teams are not the only options for him.

As for the speculations of boycotting or not reporting to the Raptors, they are purely fiction. Despite expressing his reluctance to play in Toronto, under the restrictions of the collective bargaining agreement, if Leonard doesn't report to the Raptors within a week, he will face severe penalties from the team and the league, citing "harmful to league development" as the reason. Unless Leonard is willing to pay a significant fine or even face the worst-case scenario of being expelled from the league, it is an exaggeration to describe it as "blocking a car with his arms" when going against an organization that earns $8 billion in annual revenue.

Regarding the trade itself, the Raptors only gave up Jakob Poeltl, a center who was expected to be blocked by Jonas Valanciunas for the next two years, and a heavily protected first-round pick in a weak draft year. They firmly drew the line at not including OG Anunoby in the deal.

Ujiri didn't risk his reputation as the "Executive of the Year" with this trade. He managed the risks accurately. When Tony Parker's performance after returning from injury didn't meet expectations, he decisively promoted Dejounte Murray. When the team struggled with outside shooting this season, he immediately brought back Marco Belinelli, a former teammate with great compatibility. For Aldridge, who is entering the twilight of his career, and Popovich, who could retire at any time, capturing the peak performance of these two key players is the most important task for the Spurs.

This trade is no different! Compared to the likes of Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Dario Saric, Robert Covington, and other emerging talents, DeMar DeRozan is undoubtedly the most ready-to-contribute option.

To be more objective, even if the Lakers or 76ers were willing to offer, it wouldn't be an easy task for them to reach the level of DeRozan within two years.

In a way, the Raptors' willingness to put DeMar DeRozan on the trade table is truly fortunate for the Spurs.

The most obvious comparison is the 2011 Carmelo Anthony trade, where the Nuggets sent Anthony to the Knicks mid-season and received Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, and Timofey Mozgov, along with an unprotected first-round pick. The trade resulted in a significant drop in the Nuggets' performance the following year, with fans mocking them as the "Girls' Generation." It wasn't until they acquired Andre Iguodala through a trade that the team bounced back from their low point. The talent of Chandler and Gallinari back then was no less than that of Ingram and Kuzma today. However, basketball is not just about assembling a group of players; it is a league where "a thousand soldiers are easily obtained, but a general is hard to find."
