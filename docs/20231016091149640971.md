 NBA star Jimmy Butler recently caused a stir with his hairstyle. However, after a few days of training, he has returned to his signature braided hairstyle, possibly because he didn't want it to obstruct his vision. When asked about this topic again in a recent media interview, Butler responded, "I didn't mean to make a joke. I am very focused on my work and my hairstyle didn't bother anyone. It's possible that people are just paying too much attention to what I do, I guess they are just too interested in me." Some netizens even shared Butler's official team photos from the past few years and noticed that his style changes every year. This year, we can expect to see a "stylish short-haired" Butler in every official broadcast throughout the year.
