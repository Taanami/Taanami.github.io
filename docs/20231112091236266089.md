  NBA's Giannis Antetokounmpo Supports Track and Field Athlete Noah Lyles' World Championship Statement 

 Giannis Antetokounmpo, also known as "The Greek Freak," recently came to the defense of track and field athlete Noah Lyles after Lyles received criticism for referring to himself as a "world champion" in response to NBA players winning championships. In a podcast interview, Antetokounmpo expressed his complete agreement with Lyles' point of view and stated that he understood the backlash Lyles faced.

Using soccer as an analogy, Antetokounmpo explained that in other sports leagues, such as the UEFA Champions League, teams do not refer to themselves as "world champions" even though they may be the best in their league. He also pointed out that while the NBA may be the top basketball league in the world, there are talented players and leagues in other countries that should be respected.

At the end of the interview, Antetokounmpo acknowledged that his support for Lyles may also receive criticism, but he stands by his belief that all athletes should be respected and recognized for their accomplishments. Lyles also spoke about the controversy, stating that his intention was not to diminish the achievements of NBA players, but rather to shed light on the lack of attention and recognition given to track and field athletes in the United States.
