  Reunion with the Philippines: A Memorable Moment from the 2023 World Cup

38 years ago, Arthur 'Chip' Engelland played his last official game in the Philippines. Since then, he had only returned to the country once, but in another sense, he had never left. Engelland is currently the shooting coach for the USA team in the World Cup, and it comes as no surprise that he is recognized by fans on the sidelines. Even in the United States, many Filipino-Americans would approach him on the streets for photos. Engelland remarked, "If I can be recognized in the US, it's only natural that more people in the Philippines would know me."

Engelland continued, "It's been almost 40 years since I last played on the court, yet to be recognized in the US is truly amazing. The Filipino fans are incredible. I've met some passionate fans in Las Vegas, and we sat down to chat about the PBA (Philippine Basketball Association) and our beloved country."

Please continue reading to find out how Engelland has left an indelible mark in the Philippine basketball scene. Engelland is arguably the best pure shooter in PBA history. After graduating from Duke University, he came to the Philippines to play. Engelland participated in 76 games across three PBA cups, averaging 27.5 points per game, with a record of 60 points in a single game. His precise shooting earned him the nickname "Machine Gun" among Filipino fans. Engelland was also a member of the famous Northern Consolidated Corporation (NCC) in the 1980s. NCC was the team designated by then-Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to represent the country in international tournaments.

The team trained together for several months, essentially functioning as a club team not affiliated with any league. Engelland was one of four naturalized players on the team. In 1982, they helped the Philippines secure fourth place in the Asian Games held in India. In 1985, NCC won the Asian Championship in Kuala Lumpur, earning them a spot in the 1986 FIBA World Championship in Spain.

Please continue reading to learn about their triumph in the 1985 William Jones Cup, where Engelland scored 43 points in a game against the representative team from Purdue University in the United States. Engelland said, "Without Jeff Moore and Dennis Still, we would never have won the Jones Cup. We were a versatile and cohesive team, and our bond still remains strong." These achievements made the Philippines proud and garnered attention from basketball enthusiasts. (Note: Please remove the mention of photos as per the request.)

After the conclusion of NCC's program in 1986, Engelland returned to the United States. He played in minor leagues for a few seasons before transitioning into coaching. Engelland organized camps and became a personal training consultant for players. He earned the nickname "Shot Doctor" and counted current USA team head coach Steve Kerr and general manager Grant Hill among his clients.

In the 1999-2000 season, Engelland became the shooting coach assistant for the Detroit Pistons. Three years later, he moved on to become the Director of Player Development for the Denver Nuggets. Engelland spent 17 years as an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs, helping them win two NBA championships. Players like Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, and Dejounte Murray achieved breakthroughs under his guidance, and he is widely regarded as the top assistant coach in the NBA.

Kerr had always wanted to recruit Engelland as a shooting coach for the Golden State Warriors, but their collaboration eventually happened within the national team setup.

Currently, Engelland is a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder coaching staff. He is preparing to nurture a group of talented young players such as Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams, including key players from the Canadian and Australian teams, namely Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey, who the Thunder are actively developing. Giddey speaks highly of Engelland's guidance, saying, "Since Engelland joined, I've been practicing shooting with him almost every day, 2 to 3 times a day. I spend a lot of time receiving his instructions. He's truly a genius."

Engelland also mentioned his two proteges, saying, "With SGA and Josh, Canada and Australia will definitely pose a significant challenge for us to win the championship. They have already proven themselves in the NBA."

Please continue reading to find out that Engelland's last visit to the Philippines was 17 years ago, but he only stayed for a few days. After so many years, he is now attempting to rediscover the metropolitan city that he once called home. Engelland shared, "There are many places I no longer recognize. I can still identify some people and things, and there are some streets and landmarks that I still remember. But there are too many new buildings, so I have to find new landmarks to navigate around. Nevertheless, I'm really enjoying my stay this time." Engelland also mentioned that due to a busy schedule, his primary focus is helping the USA team win the championship, so he hasn't had many opportunities to watch the current Philippine national team games. He said, "I spend a lot of time studying our opponents and helping the USA team players, but I know that the Philippines has many competitive games."
