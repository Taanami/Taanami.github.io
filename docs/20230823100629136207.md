  Review of the Top Keywords in June 2022: Warriors Win NBA Championship, BTS Announces Solo Careers without Disbanding

In just one more week, 2022 will come to an end. Let's take a look back at this year using the daily Google search trends.

In June 2022, there were several topics that caught people's attention. As seen in the chart, many keywords were related to the NBA due to the NBA Finals taking place this month.

The NBA Finals featured a competition between the Warriors and the Celtics. In the end, on June 17th, the Golden State Warriors won with a score of 4-2, making NBA the most popular keyword of the day. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 in Taiwan had passed its peak, and the daily number of confirmed cases continued to decline.

However, there was concern about Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which could appear in children about a month after being diagnosed with COVID-19. The Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center announced the number of MIS-C cases and related information during their daily press conferences. During this wave of the pandemic, a tragic incident occurred in New Taipei City where a child may have passed away due to delayed medical treatment. The child's father believes that the city government should take responsibility, and the investigation into this incident is still ongoing.

Another popular keyword in June was "Amazon Rainforest," which appeared on May 24th. This keyword trended not because of any local events related to the Amazon Rainforest, but because someone discovered that Google Maps displayed incorrect photos for locations in the Amazon Rainforest. Instead of showing photos related to the rainforest, it displayed explicit photos of a couple in a bathroom, leading to a surge in search volume. In terms of finance and economics, Bitcoin experienced a significant drop this month, falling below $20,000 and returning to its price from the end of 2020. The cryptocurrency market faced a harsh winter.

On the 16th, the Federal Reserve announced a three-digit interest rate hike to combat inflation, which was the first time in 28 years for the United States. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen continued to depreciate, reaching a new low in 20 years. As a result, both Bitcoin and interest rate hikes became hot search terms.

In terms of entertainment and cultural news, the release of "Jurassic World: Dominion" and the free availability of the game "Among Us" were trending keywords. Additionally, the exhibition "Hell and Ghosts of Asia" at the Tainan Art Museum gained popularity on social media, particularly the section featuring zombies, making the museum a trending keyword. In society, earthquakes and typhoons remained topics of interest. On June 16th, a fire in Hsinchu resulted in the death of eight family members and one injury. The tragedy received widespread attention because the arsonist was a family member. One unusual trending keyword was "Tesla shooting," which was another social incident. It involved an individual driving a Tesla who demanded another car owner to give up their charging spot. When the other person refused, the Tesla driver shot at them with a BB gun.

In terms of notable figures, several individuals gained public attention, including Johnny Depp winning his lawsuit against his ex-wife, YouTuber Josh from Tainan getting a divorce, ultramarathon runner Lin Yi-Jie (now named Lin Han-Quan) being accused of using unauthorized videos to commit crimes, the passing of "Eight-tone prodigy" Huang Wen-Ze, Tai Tzu-Ying winning the Indonesian Badminton Open, the passing of ELLE magazine's editor-in-chief Yang Yin-Jie, Korean actress Jang Na-ra getting married, Sun Yi-Zhen announcing her pregnancy, and BTS announcing their solo careers without disbanding. The keyword "Dragon Boat Festival" became popular because Google changed its homepage to feature a Dragon Boat Festival-themed Google Doodle.
