 Pre-Season Analysis of T1 Season 3 - Kaohsiung Family Mart Sea Gods Edition

Introduction: The Kaohsiung Family Mart Sea Gods were the champions of T1 League Season 1. Although they faced injury issues in Season 2, all their injured players have returned for this season, and the integration between local and foreign players is very smooth. This season will be the journey for the Sea Gods to reclaim their glory.

Let's analyze the personnel in each position of the Kaohsiung Sea Gods, their strengths and weaknesses, the problems that need to be solved, and the key players.

Time is precious, so let's get started! (I will focus on describing weaknesses and problems, as it is a professional analysis for a championship-contending team.)

Player Analysis:
Point Guard, Shooting Guard: Jason Brickman (The Brickman), Chen Huai'an, Yu Huan-ya, Su Wen-ju.
(Plus Tang Wei-jie whose situation is unknown)

Small Forward: Yu Chun-an, Wu Hsiao-chin, Qiu Zi-xuan, Lin Ren-hong.

Power Forward: Hu Long-mao, Chin Ming-ching, Wang Yong-cheng, Lu Wei-ting, Wu Yi-pin.

Center: Justin Hurtt, OJ Mayo, Dominique Jones.

In the point guard and shooting guard positions, Jason Brickman remains the starting point guard, with Chen Huai'an as the backup. Yu Huan-ya and Su Wen-ju will take turns at the shooting guard position. These two players have different styles. Yu Huan-ya is an offensive player and the Sea Gods' main shooter, while Su Wen-ju is responsible for defense, changing the pace of the game, and guarding the opponent's foreign or local scoring players.

Each of the four players in the power forward position has their own strengths and weaknesses. Lin Ren-hong's versatility and experience on the court make him a strong candidate for a starting position, but there is a concern about his previous foot injury and whether it has fully healed. Qiu Zi-xuan has explosive scoring ability and strong cutting and disrupting skills, but his inconsistency is one of his weaknesses. Yu Chun-an and Wu Hsiao-chin are more functional players who may focus on defense or three-point shooting off the bench, but they are equally important role players.

The starting choice for the local power forward position is still highly likely to be Hu Long-mao, while Lu Wei-ting and Wu Yi-pin will most likely start as substitutes, playing the role of blue-collar players and competing for playing time. 

Advantages: The Sea Gods are a team with very balanced personnel allocation, and no position is lacking. In terms of scoring, they have the playmaking ability of Jason Brickman, the three-point shooting of Yu Huan-ya, and strong scoring abilities from Qiu Zi-xuan, Lin Ren-hong, Yu Chun-an, and Wu Hsiao-chin. In the local power forward position, they have Hu Long-mao, as well as Lu Wei-ting who performed excellently in the recent World University Games. As for the center position, Justin Hurtt, OJ Mayo, and Dominique Jones are all talented players. Defensively, the Sea Gods are also strong. They have quick rotations and excellent individual defensive abilities, such as Su Wen-ju, who was heavily relied upon last season, and Lin Ren-hong, who started as a defensive player. In addition, their foreign centers have excellent rim protection abilities, providing defensive pressure to opponents' attacks. Overall, the Sea Gods are a well-rounded team with stable strength, no major weaknesses, and every game is played steadily, relying on excellent teamwork to gradually pull away and win games.

Weaknesses: The Sea Gods' strengths are also their weaknesses, as their offense is too predictable. They lack a foreign player who can score consistently, so when facing opponents with explosive foreign players, they lack someone who can match them. We can observe from the games they lost last season that the Sea Gods' scoring remained stable at their usual level, but in each of those games, there was always someone from the opposing team who suddenly stepped up and took over the game.

The second weakness is the lack of a second ball handler, despite having a strong starting point guard in Jason Brickman. In the previous season, especially in the playoffs, we could see that Brickman almost played the entire game. This led to a sharp decline in his physical condition, and in the final quarter of the fifth game, his signature jump shot missed twice. Therefore, whether the Sea Gods can find a backup point guard to replace Brickman is also a challenge for them this season.

The third concern is injuries, which was a problem the Sea Gods faced last season. Will Justin Hurtt's foot injury fully heal? Will OJ Mayo's finger injury from last season affect him this season? Will Lin Ren-hong's ankle sprain recover completely? Not to mention Hu Long-mao, who just had surgery for his back injury during the offseason. How much he can recover is still unknown. Personally, I believe this issue will be one of the factors determining how far the Sea Gods can go this season.

Problem to Solve: The Sea Gods' problem has been discussed since last season and is quite apparent - the lack of height at the power forward position. The reason behind this is their key player, point guard Jason Brickman. Since the second season, he cannot be considered a local player and must be listed as a foreign player due to league rules. As only two foreign players can be on the court at the same time, the Sea Gods lack a tall power forward or center in their lineup. In the previous season, we often saw teams bring in two tall foreign players specifically to deal with Hu Long-mao at the power forward position when facing the Sea Gods.
