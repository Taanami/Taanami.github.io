  2023 World Cup: Germany Reigns Supreme as Undefeated Champions

 Semi-final showdown between Germany and five-time world champions United States at the 2023 World Cup witnessed a historic moment as Germany defeated USA to challenge the top spot. Their opponent in the final was Serbia, another five-time world champion (referring to World Cup/World Championship).

In the 2019 World Cup final, Argentina faced Spain in a closely contested battle. The undefeated German team dominated the first quarter and maintained their lead throughout the game.

It was the last game of Argentina's World Cup career for their star player, Luis Scola. However, his performance in this tournament was the worst of the team, and Spain won the championship with a 20-point difference.

The dynamics of this year's final were different as Serbia never gave up despite being behind in the third quarter. They even had a chance to tie the game when they were down by three points in the fourth quarter but missed a crucial three-point shot. Germany's Dennis Schroder, once again, showcased his skills by scoring a layup and securing a four-point lead, ultimately sealing the victory. Serbia's coach, Svetislav Pesic, faced a disadvantage when their key defender, Ognjen Dobric, injured his ankle and could not return to the court.

Serbia had a deep and talented team, as seen in their semi-final game against Canada, where they used a 10-man rotation. However, without Dobric, they struggled to match up against Germany's tall and strong front line.

Losing one player in a high-intensity game makes a significant difference, especially when that player is as impactful as Dobric, who may not have impressive stats but has a strong presence on the court.

In the crucial moments of the third quarter, Germany's head coach, Gordon Herbert, boldly used center Johannes Voigtmann to match up against Serbia's main center, Nikola Milutinov. This strategy paid off as Serbia struggled to score inside, allowing Germany to focus on their outside defense. Serbia failed to make any three-pointers in the third quarter, scoring only 10 points, giving Germany a significant advantage.

In the fourth quarter, Serbia attempted to make a comeback, led by guard Aleksa Avramovic. However, Germany's defense made it difficult for him to score, and their top scorers, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Milutinov, were also unable to make an impact in the second half. Germany's defense forced Serbia to commit 12 turnovers, and they capitalized on these mistakes, ultimately winning the game. Franz Wagner, with his height, agility, and ability to penetrate the Serbian defense, was a major troublemaker for them. He also had 11 free throw attempts, four offensive rebounds, and three steals, making him the Most Valuable Player of the final game.

Schroder's impressive performance throughout the tournament, except for one game against Latvia, where he had a poor shooting night, earned him the MVP of the tournament. He was the heartbeat of the German team, providing consistent scoring and leading the team's offense. He also had a significant impact on the defensive end, making it difficult for Serbia's players to score. Germany's victory marks their first-ever challenge for the world championship, while Serbia has now lost in three consecutive FIBA finals.

In the 2014 World Championship final, they lost to the USA, and in the 2016 Rio Olympics, they were once again defeated by the USA. This time, Germany eliminated the USA, but their main players' injuries prevented them from claiming the championship. Apart from the Olympics and the World Cup, Serbia's last EuroBasket championship was in 2001 when they competed as Yugoslavia.

Serbia is undoubtedly a basketball powerhouse, but it has been a long time since they have lifted the ultimate trophy in a top FIBA tournament. This could potentially increase Nikola Jokic's chances of representing his country in the Olympics.
