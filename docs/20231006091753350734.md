 NBA's Nikola Jokic, the center for the Denver Nuggets, is a champion, NBA Finals MVP, and two-time MVP.

He is considered one of the best basketball players in the league, but it's evident that his passion lies more in horse racing than basketball. This was evident in his performance during the championship run. Former teammate Austin Rivers also stated that Jokic won't work as long as LeBron James. During a program, sports media personality Bill Simmons asked Rivers, "How long do you think Jokic will play? Do you think he'll be the kind of person who plays until 39?" Rivers shook his head and replied, "No, that's not possible."

Rivers continued, "I think he'll play for another 5 or 6 years. He really doesn't care about American pop culture, trends, or fame. He has no interest in those things. What interests him is not those things."
