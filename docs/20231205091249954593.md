 Video: Former NBA top pick Joe Smith discovers his wife has been secretly running an OnlyFans account and they engage in a heated argument. Photo/Twitter According to the American media "Daily Loud" today, former NBA player Joe Smith discovered that his wife Kisha Chavis (former adult film star) is still running an OnlyFans account, leading to a heated argument. Joe Smith was the number one pick in the 1995 NBA draft, and was selected by the Warriors in the first round. Although he had a good performance in his first and second years, his performance did not improve afterwards. He was traded several times in his career and played for the 76ers, Timberwolves, Pistons, Timberwolves, Bucks, Nuggets, Bulls, Cavaliers, Thunder, Cavaliers, Hawks, Nets, and Lakers, playing a total of 16 seasons in the NBA, appearing in 1030 games, with an average of 10.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 1 assist per game.

Joe Smith and Kisha Chavis got married five years ago, and in a recent self-shot video, Smith can be seen getting upset after finding out that Chavis has been running an OnlyFans account under her previous stage name Yasmine Pendavis. "I can't believe I found out that you have been running an OnlyFans account for these past few years. This is so disrespectful to me, you should have talked to me before doing this," Smith said angrily. "This is bullshxt, this is so messed up, I'm telling you, this is so messed up." However, his wife Chavis doesn't see it that way. She first defends herself by saying that she hasn't been "collaborating" with other adult performers like she used to, and then tells Smith her reasons: "This is my body, it's my damn choice, and when you see me, you'll know who I am... I thought I would never have to deal with this again. But unfortunately, the situation is not like that." The two continue to argue, with Chavis vaguely revealing that there are some financial issues in their family: "You're acting like it's the only thing I do. I have a lot of crazy jobs, but they can't provide everything we need, so I'm looking for more money on OnlyFans, what's wrong with that?" However, Smith says that regardless of the financial aspect, the fact that she is doing this behind his back remains unchanged. According to TMZ, Joe Smith earned a total of 61 million US dollars during his playing career, but after deducting agent fees and taxes, he only had 18 million US dollars left. In the past, he has also revealed on the show "Back in the Game" about the difficulties he encountered in managing his money: "Many people think that when you sign a contract, you automatically become a millionaire, but that's not the case. No one has ever really explained to me, like when I got 3 million, the US government may take 1.5 million of it, this is something I learned from it."
