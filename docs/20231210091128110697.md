He was named to the Belgian League First Team in 2019 and was selected for the All-Star game, where he also won the Three-Point Contest. Head coach Brian believes that "Mobley's excellent physical condition and diverse scoring abilities can contribute powerful offensive firepower to the team." Standing at 193cm tall, Mobley had a stellar performance during his student days.

In addition, in a game against Richmond University, he set a conference record with 9 three-pointers in a single game. After graduating from college, he joined the Belgian League's Charleroi Spirou team, officially starting his professional career. In his rookie season, he averaged 16.5 points and 2.2 assists per game with a three-point shooting percentage of 41.5%. In recent years, Mobley has been playing in European leagues, and in the 2022-23 season, he joined the French League, averaging 11.8 points and a three-point shooting percentage of 42.0%. Upon joining Taipei Warlord this season, he said, "I will give it my all to win more games and aim for the championship!" Mobley, who is visiting Taiwan for the first time, feels everything is fresh and new. He said, "I am very happy to be in Taiwan. The people are very friendly, and the environment and food are great." He is also looking forward to visiting Taipei 101 and the zoo on his off days. "I hope this season in Taiwan will be a wonderful journey!"
