The slimmed-down team captain Lin Yi-Hui of the Taishin War Gods was injured in the first quarter, but he bounced back in the second quarter, scoring from long range and close range. With an assist from Lin Ping-Sheng just before the end of the second quarter, he hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer, helping the Taishin War Gods lead Pauian Archiland 50-39 at halftime.

However, the Taishin team experienced a breakdown in their offense, giving Pauian Archiland a chance to fight back. With Lin Zi-Feng scoring 7 points in a single quarter, Pauian Archiland made a comeback with a 21-14 run, narrowing the gap to only 4 points.

In the final quarter, the Taishin War Gods finally found their offensive rhythm, led by Cao Xun-Xiang with an 11-4 run. With three minutes left in the game, Lin Ping-Sheng once again stepped up and hit multiple outside shots, helping the Taishin War Gods maintain a double-digit lead.
