 Pre-season PLG S4 Familiar and Tasty: Can the Warriors' Trio Reunite and Make History Again?

The Taipei Fubon Warriors have always had the lowest turnover rate for foreign players in the league. The foreign player combination for the upcoming season has been confirmed early on, with Ihor Zaytsev, Mike Singletary, and Chris Johnson all returning to challenge for the PLG four-peat. Each player has their own unique skills, basketball IQ, and great team awareness. They also possess the qualities to mentor young players. However, the question remains whether their age will become a hindrance and if they can overcome the challenges from other teams.

Zaytsev is known for his outstanding performance in the paint and his ability to work well with the team. Although he was affected by injuries in the first half of last season, he quickly became a key player after his return. With a high shooting percentage and strong rim protection, he, along with Cheng-Chun Tseng and Johnson, solidified the team's presence in the paint and overcame the previous decline in dominance.

He played in all 9 games of the playoffs and championship series, with increasing playing time. He contributed an all-around performance of 19 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1 steal, and 1 block per game. His versatile offensive skills make it difficult for opponents to defend against him, and his stamina remains strong. He can be considered the invisible hero behind the Warriors' three-peat.

Regarding his return to the Warriors' family, Zaytsev said, "I am determined to continue fighting for the sport I love! I have found a comfortable home with the Warriors, and we have won championships here. The feeling of winning a championship has deeply touched me. It is not easy to find a team and a city where you feel happy and comfortable. 

Like the team, I have lofty goals. We not only want to dominate in the PLG but also achieve good results in the EASL Eastern Conference. I am very happy to reunite with my teammates in the new season.

This will be my fourth season with the Warriors and my sixth year in Taiwan. Warriors fans, we will see each other soon!" Singletary, the veteran who joined the Warriors after the PLG started, formed a perfect combination with Zaytsev. Their strong lineup was unstoppable. With his robust physique and versatile offensive skills, Singletary could attack like a tank inside the paint and shoot from the perimeter like a sniper, even from a far distance. He was the ender of many critical moments.

He averaged 23.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.6 steals per game last season, consistently ranking among the top players in various statistical categories. He was a key player for the Warriors to overcome the turbulence in the first half of the season. In addition, his experience can lead young players to grow and serve as a guide for new foreign players. His conversations with Johnson on the bench, especially during the championship series, ignited his fighting spirit and helped overcome challenges. His importance is undeniable.

Singletary, who achieved many milestones last season, said, "This is the only team I want to play for. This place has become my home, and I am excited to return to the Warriors in the new season. I can't wait to join the team and fight for the championship again!" Johnson joined the Warriors only last year but quickly became an inside force. Known as the "Highlight Generator," he ignited the enthusiasm of the Peace Memorial Library with his spectacular dunks. He never hesitated to entertain the fans with his skills. In the first half of the season, he single-handedly held the paint, averaging 21.5 points, 14.5 rebounds, 4 assists, 1.6 steals, and 2.2 blocks per game. His twin towers combination with Zaytsev dominated the championship series, and he was awarded the Finals MVP with his unstoppable firepower. The 38-year-old veteran once again won favor in the spring with his terrifying athleticism, soft touch, and basketball IQ. He often became the team's offensive initiator at the start of the game, and his ability to continuously score was unstoppable, just like flowing mercury.

Johnson, entering his second year with the Warriors, said, "Last season was an incredible experience. Returning means a lot to me, and I am grateful and will never forget it. I can't wait to welcome the new season with the team!" 

With the retention of the trio of foreign players, the Warriors have successfully secured their strong backbone. They will once again fight alongside local talents to challenge for the highest honors in the PLG and EASL Eastern Conference. Their solid cohesion will be an essential weapon on the path to consecutive championships.

The table above shows the performance of the Warriors' foreign player combination in the previous season. Apart from Perry Jones, who left the team early, any combination of foreign players demonstrated a certain level of dominance. The twin towers' lineup, in particular, had a win rate of 77.7%, giving Coach Chin-Che Chou more flexibility in adjusting to different opponent lineups.

One common characteristic among the trio is their excellent team awareness. The Warriors typically prefer foreign players who understand the team's tactics and can execute them perfectly. They are unselfish on the court, always making the right decisions and sharing the ball. Their seamless teamwork is among the best in the league and is a key factor in the successful integration of local and foreign players. This will be their weapon for future championships.
