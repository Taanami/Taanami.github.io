  Green Blooded Raptors vs Philadelphia 76ers Preseason Game Observations

After a long wait, the preseason game has finally arrived. It is an opportunity to find the right chemistry for the team. Mazzulla has put together a twin tower starting lineup, which is the most important combination to work on, especially when the starters won't play too much time. However, I have to criticize our opening introductions, which seem to be the same every year. The creative department needs to step up. 

Some updates for today, Pritchard has signed a four-year, $30 million extension with the team. Although there were rumors about it before, it was still surprising to see him choose to re-sign in this situation. The team has White and Holiday blocking his position, and it's uncertain whether he's in the team's future plans. He also hasn't shown consistent performance. But considering his cheap salary, the team trusts him and maybe it can help him break free from his shackles. 

Please continue reading. However, there's unfortunate news at the beginning of the season. Jay Scrubb, who performed well in the summer league and signed a two-way contract with the team, tore his ACL during training. There's no further update yet, but he'll definitely have to rest for a while. It's a pity. 

Observations of the game: Starting five. Mazzulla has put together a twin tower starting lineup, with Double J pairing up with White in the backcourt. Let's talk about Horford and Porzingis' defense against Maxey, a speedy guard. They were standing too high in the Drop coverage position, giving Maxey too much space to drive. It heavily relied on White to chase and defend. 

In transition defense, sometimes the twin towers would hope the guards would help out first, but there were instances where there was no communication, giving the opponent opportunities for open shots. Although they adopt a sinking defensive position, when forced to switch and face mismatches, there were a few possessions where they would directly double team and then recover on defense. Sometimes, when sinking, Holiday would directly help defend the ball handler from the weak side, letting Porzingis take on the weaker player. 

On offense, both Double J are still on vacation. Their performance on offense wasn't great. It's worth noting that their timing and direction of picks wasn't good, causing many offensive runs to be stuck. Coupled with a cold shooting hand, the overall offense lacked fluidity. As for off-ball screens, it's the same problem, with two to three players crowding together, unable to create space. However, Porzingis had a few good high post plays, using his abilities to make pick and pop and pick and roll shots. He looked comfortable. 

Holiday was quick on defense and made a scoring run with Brown in the third quarter. However, as expected, in the second quarter, Tatum and Brown took turns attacking in the low post, causing the opponent to hesitate in double teaming due to the threat of outside shooters. At the end of the quarter, there was also an attempt at a one big and four small lineup with Double J, White, and Holiday. It's a lineup that I believe will be used in crucial moments, but there weren't many attempts at using it, so we'll have to observe more. 

Please continue reading for bench power. Even though everyone thinks the Celtics have lost depth, don't underestimate our bench players. Pritchard is the key to opening up our three-point shooting. He's confident in taking shots at a fast pace and has improved in controlling the pace of the game, with good changes in speed. He also has the ability to be a scorer, with a few plays where he took the ball, step back, and shot a three-pointer, reminiscent of the "Fast PP." On the front line, Brissett and Stevens have influenced the game with their tenacity as expected. However, Kornet seemed to struggle with the fast pace, with a few butterfingers moments. Banton's offense, on the other hand, was not very promising. ---- Ubuntu ðŸ¦–
