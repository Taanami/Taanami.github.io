  The Test Stone of Chinese Men's Basketball at the World University Games: Qiu Zixuan, the War God, Demonstrates Strength and Style

Qiu Zixuan, the power forward of the Kaohsiung Family Mart Sea Gods in the Chinese men's basketball team, has shouldered the responsibility of the front line in this year's World University Games. He has not only shown excellent skills in both offense and defense, but also displayed a dominating presence on the court, once again living up to his nickname as the War God. Benefiting from the injuries within the team last year, Qiu Zixuan gained many opportunities to play and his explosive offensive energy often made it difficult for opponents to resist. With his agility and assertive moves, his future prospects are very promising.

Although Qiu Zixuan was unable to win a championship, it is undoubtedly his biggest regret. Whether in Dongshan High School, National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism, or in his professional career, he has always been unable to personally touch the championship trophy. He earned the title of "Dongshan War God" in the High School Basketball League (HBL), leading his team to the top four in the league and achieving the best record in team history. After studying at a university in the United States, he returned to Taiwan in 2020 and joined National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism. He performed well and decided to challenge himself in the professional league. In the first round of the T1 League draft, he was selected by the Kaohsiung Family Mart Sea Gods, allowing him to stay in the familiar environment of southern Taiwan and reunite with his college coach, Xie Yujuan.

The Sea Gods' head coach, Brendan Joyce, has never been afraid to use rookies, so Qiu Zixuan quickly became a key player off the bench. His versatile offensive skills and speed make him the pivot for changing the team's pace. In the game against the Clouded Leopards on December 4th, he scored an impressive 31 points, 3 rebounds, 4 assists, and 2 steals in just 27 minutes. His sharp and accurate attacks, as well as his fearlessness in facing foreign players, make it hard to believe that he is a rookie in his first year of professional play. In the second half of the season, the team's front line suffered from injuries, giving him the opportunity to showcase his talents. Despite needing improvement in his shooting percentage, he solidly contributed to the team's score and played a crucial role in changing the momentum during the playoffs. Throughout the season, he averaged nearly 20 minutes on the court, contributing 7.7 points, 3 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game, making him the only rival to Gu Mao Wei Jia in the Rookie of the Year race.

Of course, for the Sea Gods, who came to defend their title, they faced many challenges and were eliminated in the first round by the Hawks. However, nurturing the future star Qiu Zixuan has made the team's front line even stronger. Lin Renhong and Wu Xiaojin will no longer be isolated.

Qiu Zixuan, Su Wenru, and Lü Weiting were all selected for this year's World University Games team, and all three of them have performed well. They can both attack and defend in the front line. Although they are not tall enough to resist opponents, they have become the backbone of the Chinese team and have grown through exchanges with world-class players. Please continue reading ▼

From the perspective of the author, Qiu Zixuan can be considered the most consistent player, apart from You Aizhe, Gao Jinwei, and Lin Zhijie. He was set as a starter from the beginning. Except for the games against Lithuania and Japan, he scored in double digits in all other games. In the match against China, he frequently broke through the defense and grabbed 9 rebounds, punishing opponents who tried to guard him one-on-one.

In the ranking matches against South Africa and Poland, his performance on the outside was particularly outstanding, hitting three three-pointers in each game. The combination of inside and outside play made it difficult for opponents to defend against him. In addition, his defense is also impressive. Although lacking in technique, he compensates with his determination. He performs well in the wide area, the second and third zones, and individual defense. He made 11 steals in six games, triggering several fast breaks, showcasing the fast-paced playing style of his coach Liu Mengzhu.

Qiu Zixuan averaged 10.6 points, 3 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 1.8 steals per game. His playing time increased with each game, highlighting his importance to the team. Although he is only 190 cm tall and struggles against European and American powerhouses, he is the first player in the Chinese team who can break through the limitations. Alongside You Aizhe and Gao Jinwei, he constantly disrupts the opponent's defense, bringing important speed and impact, just like in his professional league experience.

Seeing his performance reminds me of Lin Zhijie in the early stages of his career. They are similar in height, but exude a commanding presence and are fearless in both offense and defense. This is the courage that young players should have, and it truly reflects his title as the "War God". His offense is even more impressive than his defense. He has a stable shooting mechanism and accurate outside shooting. He does not take shots casually or hastily. He understands tactics and positioning, inheriting the characteristics of players produced by National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism. His cutting speed and soft shooting touch, although mainly attacking the basket, are sufficient and flexible. Of course, young players still need to put in effort. Once they are double-teamed or pushed to the sideline, mistakes are more likely to occur. Ball handling also needs improvement. However, his awareness of offense and defense and execution of tasks are on point, making him a reliable player.

▼ "Holding the ball" becomes a future task, allowing the War God to shine
In fact, Qiu Zixuan is a player with a good shooting touch. It wouldn't be a bad option for him to transform into a shooting guard or focus on shooting. However, he did not choose this path and instead became a versatile front line player. Although his moves and finesse need improvement, I believe this is the key to him finding a unique position in the future.

Moreover, professional teams lack front line players who can handle the ball and attack. Most of the time, they rely on guards or inside players to score. If he can develop a variety of offensive skills, he could become one of the players who can provide firepower from the front line.
