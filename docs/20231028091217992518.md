After the game, he was asked about his new teammates and environment. Lillard specifically mentioned that playing alongside Antetokounmpo every night will cause major problems for opponents, and that assistant coach Terry Stotts (former Trail Blazers head coach) has designed many familiar tactics for him.

The reporter also asked Lillard about the remaining amount on his contract. Lillard has four years remaining on his contract worth a total of $216 million, with $63 million in the final year when he will be 38 years old. Many people doubt whether it is worth giving such a large contract at that age, and Lillard responded to these doubts after yesterday's game.

"I don't know why they (the outside world) think like that." "I have not lived a difficult life, and I have not shown any signs of decline. People see me and say, 'Oh, he's injured.' But I didn't get injured last year. Two years ago, I did have an injury, but I chose to have surgery to fix it." "I've been healthy throughout my entire career, so when I see these things (doubts from the outside world), it's like they're giving me a chance to prove them wrong. I guarantee you that at 38 years old, I will move the same way as I do now, and shooting will not disappear."
