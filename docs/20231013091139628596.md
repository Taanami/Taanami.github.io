 NBA star Derrick Rose was seen playing a game of chess at a recent concert by rapper Drake. The event was attended by Rose and his wife, Alaina A Anderson Rose, who captured the moment on video. In the video, Rose can be seen casually taking out his phone and starting a game of chess, much to the amusement of his wife. She shared the video on her Instagram story with the caption, "When I let my husband out of the house (a series of crying emojis)." The video quickly went viral with fans commenting, "Rose, I want to challenge you. If you win, I'll buy your jersey. If you lose, give me a game ticket," "As a former chess champion, I have to admit, we have a lot of power," and "Rose is too chill."
