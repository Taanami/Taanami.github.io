 According to reporter Shams Charania, Memphis Grizzlies center Steven Adams will undergo knee surgery and be out for the entire season.

Adams has not played since the end of January last year against the Suns due to a knee injury. The initial diagnosis was a sprained posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, and he received stem cell treatment. The Grizzlies announced that Adams will undergo surgery to repair his posterior cruciate ligament, as non-surgical rehabilitation was not effective in maintaining stability in his knee.

Adams appeared in two preseason games this year against the Pacers and Hawks, but ultimately decided to undergo surgery before the start of the season. The Grizzlies have been hit hard by injuries in the second half of last season, with both Adams and Brandon Clarke (Achilles tear) sidelined. This will put even more pressure on Jaren Jackson Jr. in the frontcourt. In 42 games last season, Adams provided the Grizzlies with excellent rim protection and was a dominant force on the boards, averaging 8.6 points, 11.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.1 blocks per game.
