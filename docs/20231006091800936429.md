Not only did they win the UBA Men's First Division championship for three consecutive years, but the National Chengchi University Eagles men's basketball team also won the WUBS championship in Japan this year. In the first game of the cross-league basketball invitational match today, despite the absence of the "strongest foreign student" Mobaye, they still defeated the SBL representative team Taiwan Bank with a score of 87:76. Even Nie Ou Ma, a new member of Taiwan Bank, praised that the "alma mater" is not what it used to be.

Nie Ou Ma, who is 205 cm tall, comes from Senegal, and his first stop in Taiwan was National Chengchi University. In the first season of UBA, National Chengchi University Eagles men's basketball team was promoted to the Men's First Division. After helping the team win the championship in the 109th academic year, Nie Ou Ma participated in the 2021 PLG draft and was selected by the New Taipei Kings in the 7th pick of the first round. After two seasons with the Kings, he became a free agent this summer and officially joined Taiwan Bank in early September. In today's cross-league match against his alma mater, Nie Ou Ma believes that the alma mater has improved year by year, and the team now is at a different level compared to when he was in school.

He pointed out that National Chengchi University has a diverse offensive strategy, can play inside and outside, and plays with unity. However, he admitted that he didn't perform well in the third quarter when his alma mater launched a 25:8 offensive, but he believes that if the defense is in place, he can still block his younger teammates.

After staying in Taiwan for many years, Nie Ou Ma can now speak some Chinese. He said that he is currently adapting to his new teammates in Taiwan Bank and said in Chinese, "Take it slow." He looks forward to performing well in the new season of the SBL. Taiwan Bank's head coach, Chen Guo-Wei, is a member of the coaching staff of the Chinese men's basketball team in the Hangzhou Asian Games. Although he was present today, the team's management was still led by Xu Zhi-Qiang. Chen emphasized that today's loss was due to "losing to themselves." Both offense and defense did not meet the standards of their usual training. "Especially in the third quarter, we allowed three three-pointers, and there were also many mistakes in offense. We couldn't achieve good ball movement and couldn't bring out the intensity. If we don't perform well, the result is not surprising." National Chengchi University today relied on new foreign student Popoka as the main force in the paint. Head coach Chen Zi-Wei explained that Mobaye had some family matters and is expected to return to the team on the 19th. This cross-league match is also a good opportunity for the young players to encourage them to show their attitude and style and learn from their senior players in professional teams.
