 In their first game of the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, the Chinese team faced Hong Kong, a team with a significant difference in size and strength. The Chinese team quickly established a double-digit lead in the first quarter and maintained a steady lead throughout the game, ultimately winning by 19 points.

While the Chinese team's victory was not insignificant, it was not a particularly impressive win either. All five players scored in double digits and the team had a nearly 20-point margin of victory, but upon closer examination, there are still many areas that need improvement.

One of the issues in this game was the limited vision of center William Joseph Artino, who was unable to fully utilize his height advantage. The Chinese team had a significant height advantage at every position, especially in the paint, where Hong Kong only had two players over 6'7" compared to China's four, with their starting center Duncan Overbeck Reid standing at only 6'9" compared to Artino's 6'11". However, Hong Kong primarily used a "small-ball" lineup, which allowed the Chinese team to dominate the paint. While the Chinese team did have a slight advantage in second-chance points, they did not fully exploit their height advantage.

Hong Kong's defense was also highly active, quickly collapsing on Chinese players in the low post or on screens, making it difficult for the Chinese team to score in the paint.

Unfortunately, Artino's limited passing vision prevented the Chinese team from taking full advantage of Hong Kong's defensive collapse. The team's big men also did not perform as well as expected, as Hong Kong's perimeter defenders were not particularly skilled at one-on-one defense. Instead, the Chinese team relied on their three main scorers, Lin Tingqian, Abasi, and Liu Zheng, who used their individual abilities to continue scoring steadily.

In this game, the Chinese team used a man-to-man defense for most of the game, with a clear goal from the coaching staff to force turnovers and score in transition.

While this defensive strategy did create turnovers, Hong Kong also had a high turnover rate, with 23 compared to China's 13. However, Hong Kong's quick transition defense limited China's fast break opportunities, and they only had a slight advantage in transition points. Please continue reading below for more on the team's failure to capitalize on turnovers.

Since the man-to-man defense did not produce the intended results and came at a cost, there was no need to stick with it. The coaching staff should have made adjustments on the spot, such as shrinking the defensive coverage or switching to a zone defense. Additionally, since Hong Kong struggled with their outside shooting, only hitting 20% of their three-pointers, the Chinese team could have considered a "no layup, no foul" defense.

The team's slow adjustments on defense have been an issue before, as seen in their previous games against Iran and the United States in the Jones Cup, where they were slow to react and failed to make timely adjustments. This is an area that the coaching staff needs to pay more attention to. While it's not surprising that the Chinese team easily defeated a weaker opponent like Hong Kong, it's clear that they have not yet reached their full potential. For example, their outside shooting was not as effective as usual, with a 22.9% three-point shooting percentage compared to 34.6% in the Jones Cup.

For the Chinese team, it is important to make the most of the remaining group stage games and continue to improve as they aim for the quarter-finals. â€»For more basketball articles, follow my Instagram page @etbasketball.
