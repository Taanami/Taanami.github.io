 The coexistence of the 2023 World Cup and the pressure of the World Cup: Steve Kerr's inheritance and reflection

August 24th was a significant day for the head coach of the US team, Steve Kerr. Because of the jersey number that Kobe Bryant carried during his 20-year NBA career, basketball fans around the world associate this day with Kobe Bryant. This day was also crucial for the US team as they played their first game in the 2023 FIBA World Cup.

In the official press conference before the opening game against New Zealand on August 26th, Steve Kerr and Jalen Brunson were interviewed about their first impressions of the Philippines and the challenges they would face.

However, August 24th held a personal significance for Kerr. "August 24th is my mother's birthday, and that's the biggest impression I have of this day," he replied with a smile when asked about his memories of Kobe Bryant. He humorously added, "Happy birthday, Mom, but I'm sure she's not watching."

Kerr recalled his memories of Kobe, saying, "I played against him as a player, and after I started coaching in the later stages of Kobe's career, I have had wonderful memories with him. It was a great privilege to be able to compete with one of the greatest players in NBA history. Even today, we still remember Kobe and the significance he had for all of us and the entire league."

The US team is currently competing in the FIBA World Cup, with their mission being to reclaim the world championship after finishing in seventh place in 2019, which was the second-worst result in US team history.

However, after losing to Lithuania in their first game and then losing to Germany in the semifinals, it is confirmed that the US team will not be able to win the gold medal this year.

Kerr, who took over as the head coach of the US team this year, previously talked about his experience as an assistant coach to Gregg Popovich in 2019 and 2021, and how it influenced him as a first-time head coach of a national team.

Kerr praised the team, saying, "That experience really determined how we selected this team. We wanted players who we believed could come together as a team in a short amount of time. We have a great group of players who are connected to each other and enjoy playing together."

"Being an assistant coach to Gregg Popovich in 2019 and 2021 was a really good experience for me because it allowed me to understand how to build a team in a six-week period. It's completely different from the NBA where you can't build continuity and accumulate experiences to build a team. You have to do it like this," Kerr snapped his fingers, indicating the need to efficiently complete the task in a short amount of time.

Kerr also admitted that his team learned some valuable lessons in the early stages. The US team won all five of their warm-up games against Puerto Rico (117-74), Slovenia (92-62), Spain (98-88), Greece (108-86), and Germany (99-91). "The most important thing is to familiarize ourselves with FIBA rules and stay united. In this process, we faced strong opponents, and we have confidence, but we also faced some setbacks. Spain and Germany challenged us, and these experiences have helped us because we know how strong these teams are," Kerr praised the German and Spanish teams for pushing them to the limit in the warm-up games.

For the US team, anything other than a gold medal is considered a failure. However, the US team's point guard, Jalen Brunson, does not shy away from the challenge. "Personally, I don't believe in 'pressure'," the New York Knicks star replied when asked about pressure. "I understand that as long as I give my all in my game, there is no such thing as pressure. There are moments and situations that require facing difficult odds, but my confidence comes from my professional ethics. As long as I continue to work hard and understand that I strive for improvement every day, there is no pressure. I think for the team, in those moments, we heavily rely on each other," Brunson analyzed. Kerr, who won the gold medal in the FIBA World Cup in 1986, also talked about the weight of responsibility. Kerr explained, "Pressure is self-imposed. We all love what we do. I love coaching, and I also love the pressure or what we call competition. Being a competitor also means accepting the possibility of defeat. That's the essence of the game. There are wins and losses." He added, "Effort, approach, and chemistry are key. I love being part of a team. I love what we are doing right now, trying to build something and taking risks. Of course, the beauty of sports is that there is no risk of losing our lives. But we compete, we give our all, we strive for glory, and we know that if we fail, we may face criticism, and we accept that. But our mindset is that this is a very enjoyable thing. We are extremely fortunate to be a part of all this, to compete, and when we look back on all this in our lives, we know that we have given our all. Like I said, we are working hard and we want to win, but whatever happens, happens. That's part of the game."
