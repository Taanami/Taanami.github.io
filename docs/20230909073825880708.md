 Is gender pay equality in sports reasonable before the Women's World Cup in New Zealand?

According to The Washington Post, the female members of the Western Springs Association Football Club in New Zealand have recently reached an agreement with the management to raise their salaries and resources to be equal to male players. The ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup, jointly hosted by New Zealand and Australia, is also set to open in New Zealand on July 20.

Pip Meo, a former member of the New Zealand national team and a driving force behind the agreement, pointed out that the fight for equal pay is not just about salaries but about the value of women's sports and sending a positive message to generations of girls wearing soccer shoes. Meo added, "We can't celebrate yet because we still have to see how this deal turns out, and we've only gotten what we should have gotten." The Washington Post reported that although New Zealand's global image is constantly improving, its soccer industry has long faced issues of unequal pay and resource allocation between genders.

Most soccer clubs in New Zealand are amateur clubs run by volunteers, and the maximum salary a player can receive is regulated by the national soccer federation at around $94 per week. However, whether clubs will distribute salaries equally has not received much attention from the government.

In New Zealand's soccer community, women receive lower salaries, less field access, fewer resources, training opportunities, and coaching staff compared to men. Usually, women's teams only have one coach, while men's teams have several.

In 2022, members of the Manukau United soccer team in New Zealand initiated a campaign for gender pay and resource equality but ended in failure.

Maia Jackman, a team member, stated, "Many female players from various teams will stand up for themselves, but they will be discouraged and eventually give up. However, the people at Western Springs are different; they have consistently stood by their beliefs without backing down."

Meo and Jackman joined the Western Springs Association, where most of the board members are men, in 2023, and once again attempted to achieve gender equality in soccer. After two months of struggle, Meo and Jackman, along with two pro bono lawyers, reached an agreement with the club's management through a 12-hour marathon-style mediation session and the threat of a strike, achieving gender equality. The club also issued a statement apologizing for its past shortcomings. Regarding the successful negotiation, Meo responded that the new agreement has not officially been implemented yet, so they can't be too happy too soon. Jackman stated, "Ultimately, we just want to play without restrictions or concerns."

Jackman mentioned that her focus will now be on the World Cup, hoping to showcase the charm of women's soccer through this event.

According to CBS and Lexology reports, gender pay inequality exists in many sports worldwide. For example, in basketball, the average annual income of male NBA players is $5.3 million, with star players earning even more. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant had annual salaries of $45.7 million and $42 million, respectively, last year.

In contrast, the average annual income of female WNBA players is only $130,000, with the highest-earning player in the league making only $230,000.

However, the reports also point out that the main reason for the wage gap between men and women in sports is that women's sports are not as popular as men's sports and generate less revenue and ticket sales, naturally resulting in lower salaries. NBA's revenue for the previous season was around $10 billion, while WNBA's revenue was only $60 million.

However, focusing on American football, the US women's national team has generated more revenue and attracted more viewers than the men's team since 2019, yet their income and winning bonuses were still lower than those of male players until last year. Lexology reports that the most effective way to promote gender equality in sports is to promote women's sports more.

Encouraging advertising and media coverage of female athletes and encouraging businesses to invest more in women's sports and athletes can bring more attention and revenue, contributing to equal pay between men and women.
