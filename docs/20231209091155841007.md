After two weeks of back-to-back games, the New Taipei Kings and Taoyuan Pure Gardens Leading Apes team once again engaged in a fierce battle today. The two teams kept the game close throughout, but in the fourth quarter, the Kings' Lin Shu-hao stepped up and scored 17 of his 37 points, including two long three-pointers. In the end, the Kings won 98-92 to secure their fourth consecutive win of the season.

Last week, the Kings narrowly defeated the Leading Apes at home in the last minute. The two teams faced off again today, and the Leading Apes once again put a lot of pressure on the undefeated Kings. In particular, Lu Jun-xiang, who had a poor start to the season, scored 10 points in the first quarter, including two three-pointers, and scored 15 points in the first half to help the Leading Apes lead 47-44.

However, the Kings' offense gradually woke up in the second half. First, the two foreign players, Manny Gao and Muluns, led the team to a barrage of 30 points in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Lin Shu-hao stepped up as the "fourth quarter hero", scoring 17 points in that quarter, including two long three-pointers to quell the Leading Apes' comeback. In the end, the Kings defeated the Leading Apes by 6 points to secure their fourth consecutive win and continue to hold the top spot in the standings. Lin Shu-hao scored a PLG career-high and season-high 37 points, including 17 points in the fourth quarter. He also had 8 rebounds and 5 assists. As for Manny Gao, he had 19 points, while Lu Jun-xiang led the Leading Apes with 20 points, but 15 of them were scored in the first half.
