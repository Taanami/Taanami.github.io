  Everglory Cup International Basketball Invitational: The Ultimate Stage for the Strongest High School Teams from Japan, Korea, Philippines and the US

In the form of an international invitational tournament, the 10th Everglory Cup will not only fulfill its promise to continue the college division from the previous season, but also invite representative high school teams from Japan, Korea, Philippines and the US to compete in Taiwan. These teams include: Japan's Fukushima Commercial High School, Japan Sakura Academy High School, Korea's Bongpyeong Commercial High School, Philippines' Manila Athenaeum University High School, and the US TSF Atlanta Preparatory School. This tournament aims to create a high-intensity international competition platform and enhance the international competitiveness of student players. With an annual budget of over 10 million, the Everglory Cup is dedicated to promoting and supporting student basketball. It has been known as the "HBL Prologue" and has broken the HBL division between A and B and earned the reputation of "Taiwan Basketball Koshien". In the third edition, the "U16 Taiwan Team" was set up as a warm-up for the high school men's basketball team, and the fourth edition invited China's Shenzhen New Century Men's Basketball and Guangdong Provincial Youth Women's Basketball teams to join, establishing a cross-strait exchange platform. In the 10th anniversary after bidding farewell to the pandemic, the Everglory Cup will once again announce its presence in the form of an international invitational tournament, with the goal of enhancing international competitiveness as an important target for the future.

This year, a total of 51 high school and college teams from Taiwan and 5 international teams will participate. The international teams include representative high schools from Japan, Korea, Philippines and the US, led by Japan U18 men's basketball head coach Shinya Mizuno, including: "Fukushima Commercial High School", which has nurtured many players for the national teams and world-renowned basketball stars, and holds the record of the most championships in Japan's high school basketball history with a score of "268:0" in a single game, "Sakura Academy High School", known as the "female emperor" of Korean high school basketball, "Bongpyeong Commercial High School", TSF Atlanta Preparatory School, where Ma Jianhao and other world-class players have gone to pursue their dreams, and Manila Athenaeum University High School, which has won multiple UAAP championships. These 5 strong teams have nurtured numerous U16-U19 national team players and coaches, international stars, WNBA and even FIBA Hall of Famers in their respective countries. It is worth looking forward to the sparks they will bring to the local players.

As the Everglory Cup enters its 10th year, Chairman Xie Jianguo continues to take action to support the development of student sports.

"International sports events are everywhere after the pandemic, and it is not difficult to see the explosive growth of overall strength in Asia, especially Japan.

In contrast, how Taiwan can keep up with and even surpass this trend will be a crucial factor in sports cultivation in the future." Chairman Xie Jianguo, founder of the Everglory Cup, sees this as a responsibility of the company. With his background as a basketball player, he hopes to use the company's practical support to work with the government and society to promote the education and development of student basketball in Taiwan.

Seeing the improvement of students' international competitiveness as a personal responsibility, the Everglory Cup hopes to provide more support to the basketball world through corporate investment. The 10th Everglory Cup will be held simultaneously at the Xinzhuang Gymnasium and Nanshan High School Gymnasium from September 4th to 17th, and the opening ceremony will be held on the afternoon of September 11th.

The two-week tournament will adopt a single elimination format for the college division, while the high school division will first have a round-robin stage before advancing to the second stage to compete against the international teams for the ultimate championship. Admission is free every day, and various theme games, lucky draws, and market booths have been set up. Fans who love basketball are invited to join us in this exciting event.
