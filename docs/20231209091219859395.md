2023-24 Season Analysis: A New Era Begins for the Dallas Mavericks

In his third season as the new general manager, Nico Harrison successfully made moves that reflect his personal style, ushering the Dallas Mavericks into a new era led by Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.

The young duo will lead a rejuvenated team in their quest to return to the playoffs and erase the disappointment of last season's early exit. Let's take a closer look at the team's roster changes and make some predictions for the upcoming season.

In: Out: 
Backcourt: Seth Curry Donte Exum Frank Ntilikina Theo Pinson Wings: Grant Williams Olivier-Maxence Prosper Derrick Jones Jr. Markieff Morris (re-signed) Reggie Bullock Justin Holiday Frontcourt: Richaun Holmes Dereck Lively II Dwight Powell (re-signed) Christian Wood Davis Bertans JaVale McGee 

Projected Depth Chart:
Starters: Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving, Tim Hardaway Jr., Seth Curry, Jaden Hardy
Bench: Donte Exum, Josh Green, Grant Williams, Olivier-Maxence Prosper, Derrick Jones Jr., Markieff Morris, Dereck Lively II, Dwight Powell, Maxi Kleber
The above depth chart is based on the current preseason schedule and it shows that the Mavericks have a deep roster. With the exception of Morris, all other bench players have a chance to crack the rotation. 

Key Focus: A New Era Begins

Last season's starting five consisted of Doncic, Spencer Dinwiddie, Reggie Bullock, Dorian Finney-Smith, and JaVale McGee, with only Doncic remaining on the team. With Irving now on board, the Mavericks have a new dynamic duo leading the team.

Projected Starting Lineup:
PG: Luka Doncic
SG: Kyrie Irving
SF: Josh Green
PF: Grant Williams
C: Dereck Lively II

This starting lineup has a strong defensive presence and switchability, with all players being young and full of potential. The question mark will be Lively's ability to hold down the center position and whether Green and Williams can step up as the team's third option.

Irving's three-year contract is the countdown timer for the Mavericks' championship aspirations. With the team's focus on developing young talent while also making a playoff push, it is a delicate balance that many teams have failed to achieve. The success of the Mavericks will rely on their ability to turn potential into tangible results.

Therefore, the main focus of the season will be on building a new system and establishing chemistry among the players. The duo of Doncic and Irving must also find a way to coexist and lead the team to success.

Weaknesses: Rebounding, Rim Protection, Coaching Staff

Rebounding and rim protection have been persistent issues for the Mavericks. Doncic was the team's top rebounder last season (12.4% rebound rate), with only Powell, Williams, Irving, Green, and Holmes having a rebound rate above 6.0%. In terms of blocks per-36, only Holmes and Kleber averaged more than 1.0 (1.1 and 1.2 respectively).

Harrison will surely be focused on addressing these weaknesses, and if there is no significant improvement by mid-season, he will likely make moves to address these issues.

Aside from the roster, the coaching staff will also be under scrutiny, as they were deemed inadequate last season.

Head coach Jason Kidd led the Milwaukee Bucks to the playoffs last season, but they were eliminated in the second round by the Wizards. The Bucks also lost to the Heat in the first round. Kidd's defensive strategies against his former player, Giannis Antetokounmpo, were heavily criticized, and his teams have consistently underperformed in the playoffs. It remains to be seen if Kidd can bring success to the Mavericks, who are not highly regarded by many experts. Therefore, patience will be key for the Mavericks in the early part of the season.
