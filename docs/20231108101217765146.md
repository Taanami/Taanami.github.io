After carefully reviewing Scottie Barnes' draft report, it is evident that there are high expectations for him: Scottie Barnes has the potential to become a point forward, a player similar to Ben Simmons.

However, the difference is that Barnes has a real chance to develop his outside shooting ability, and we may expect him to reach the ceiling that Simmons was supposed to touch.

Please continue reading. However, in his rookie season, the team did not seem to be grooming him as expected in the draft report. Despite winning the Rookie of the Year award with averages of 15.3 points, 7.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.1 steals per game, Barnes did not take on the organizing responsibilities like Simmons did. However, this also benefited his overall performance, with a true shooting percentage of 55.2%, a free throw percentage of 73.5%, and 58 made three-pointers (Simmons has only made five in his entire career).

Most importantly, Barnes showed no fear and overcame limitations with joy and passion. Photo source: Getty Images One year later, things feel a little different. Barnes' organizing ability has slightly improved in his second season, with an average of 4.8 assists per game, but his field goal and three-point percentages have declined.

His jump shot seems to be a big problem for the Raptors, and without a stronger offensive advantage, he cannot showcase his organizing ability through his own threat.

Please continue reading. In his first two seasons, Barnes attempted 417 three-pointers, with a shooting percentage of 29.0%. Last season, his two-point shooting percentage dropped significantly, from 38.7% to 32.9%.

Among the 75 players who attempted at least 200 shots last season, his effective field goal percentage on all pull-up jumpers was only 34.5%.

Due to the decrease in offensive efficiency, opponents started to change their strategies. As the season progressed, we saw opponents giving Barnes a lot of space at the top of the arc, cutting off all passing lanes. At this point, Barnes' only offensive options were to shoot directly or drive into the crowded paint with the ball.

Based on this, any jump shot choice by Barnes is almost a defensive victory. The only effective countermeasure he has tried is to slightly move the ball to the side, then back down on the defender, giving up space and using post moves to score. This is a good way to score, but his efficiency in scoring with post moves is similar to that of mid-range jumpers.

Please continue reading. Poor shooting efficiency is the problem that Barnes must face and the difference between his current state and potential ceiling.

Barnes currently does not have excellent shooting ability, but he is willing to shoot from different positions and use that to test the defense, which is obviously beneficial. We all know how opponents look at and limit Ben Simmons after he lost his desire to shoot. Therefore, even if Scottie Barnes' shooting efficiency does not improve, he still has a certain level of restraint and can punish opponents when he is hot. Barnes' physique, agility, ball handling ability, and vision are all very unique.

He is a disruptive defender, but is still exploring on the offensive end. He doesn't need to become a shooter like Kevin Durant, but even if he is just a slightly above-average scorer in the league, he can still become an All-Star player and an essential part of the Raptors' rebuilding process.

Training shooting is not the only way. Giannis Antetokounmpo overcame similar problems by relying on his physical advantages and increasing his strength to overpower opponents. In theory, this method can also work for Barnes - become a great finisher and frequently attack the basket, using his physical condition to force opponents to change their defensive strategies.

However, the Raptors see something in Barnes. If he can improve his shooting, he will have more offensive options. The Step Back ranks Scottie Barnes as the 15th best player under 25 years old in the 2023-24 season.

Barnes can still become one of the best players in the league. However, he needs to readjust and make progress this year, otherwise he runs the risk of stagnation.
