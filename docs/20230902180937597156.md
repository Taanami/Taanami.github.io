  Japan led France in the warm-up match for the World Cup, with Rudy Gobert discussing the challenge of facing Japan's fast shooters.

Today, the World Cup warm-up match took place in Japan, where Japan initially led France but ultimately lost with a score of 88-70.

Rudy Gobert, the center for the Minnesota Timberwolves, contributed 16 points and 9 rebounds for the fifth-ranked French team. On the other hand, Japan's NCAA star, Keisei Tominaga, scored the highest of the game with 20 points for the 36th-ranked Japanese team.

The French team, which includes several current and former NBA players, is one of the toughest opponents in this tournament. It was initially thought that France would dominate Japan in this game, but Japan's resilient playing style gave fans hope for an upset victory against a European team.

In the absence of their star player, Yuta Watanabe, the Japanese team relied on shooter Keisei Tominaga to provide offensive firepower. The 22-year-old guard played exceptionally well, hitting a three-pointer to bring Japan's score to 3-7 and continued to make shots from beyond the arc, igniting the enthusiasm of the 13,009 spectators in the arena.

With the advantage of forcing turnovers and making three-pointers, Japan took the lead twice. They ended the first quarter trailing 20-23 and remained close in the second quarter with a score of 40-45 going into halftime.

At the beginning of the third quarter, France extended their lead to 53-44, but Japan continued to narrow the gap through their shooting.

Led by Gobert, Evan Fournier of the New York Knicks, and former San Antonio Spurs player Nando de Colo, the French team launched a 25-17 offensive in the third quarter, taking control of the game. "I felt like we had a chance to win until halftime," said Tom Hovasse, the head coach of the Japanese team. "We lost the game, but we gained confidence. Our shooting percentage was not at the required level, and we didn't have enough free throws. These are the problems we need to address."

Despite the absence of Yuta Watanabe and Rui Hachimura, the former power forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, Gobert, the three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, wasn't surprised by the intensity of the first half against the Japanese team. "They are a team with many shooters and fast players," Gobert said. "The first quarter was a bit tough, but later we were able to recover, become more physical, and dominate the game." In the next match, France will face Australia, another contender for the World Cup medals, at the same venue in Tokyo for further warm-up games.
