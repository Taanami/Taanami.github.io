# The video turned the basketball court into a fairground 
 The video turned the basketball court into a fairground. The Serbian basketball team, Belgrade Guerrillas, moved their warm-up game outdoors and set off fireworks on the sidelines to show their passion for the sport. Taiwanese fans are not familiar with the enthusiasm of European fans for basketball, football, or any other sport. After the recent World Cup, warm-up games for professional basketball leagues around the world have started. The Serbian powerhouse, KK Partizan, held their warm-up game outdoors, and European fans showed their passion for the game by setting off fireworks right on the sidelines to support their team.

During the ongoing game, when the team was leading by a large margin, they set off fireworks high in the sky on the sidelines. Even when former NBA player PJ Dozier dunked the ball, fireworks and other items were simultaneously released, creating a spectacular scene. The live broadcast at the venue was also obscured by the smoke from the fireworks. This game marked the first time that Frank Kaminsky and PJ Dozier played for Belgrade Guerrillas in their home court in Serbia. It is believed that this memory will be unforgettable for them. Belgrade Guerrillas defeated their Spanish opponent, Baloncesto Fuenlabrad, by a difference of 30 points (93-63) in this game.
