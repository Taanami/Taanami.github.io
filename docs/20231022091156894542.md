The Taiwan Professional Basketball League (PLG) preseason for the new season will start tomorrow and last for three days during the National Day holiday. There will be two games played each day at the Keelung Municipal Sports Center. Mayor Xie Guo-liang and Speaker Tong Tzu-wei attended the press conference before the preseason games today, hoping to keep local basketball talents in Keelung and welcoming future professional teams to settle in Keelung as their home court city.

On the first day of the new season preseason tomorrow, the Dreamers will play against the Attack Lions, followed by the Fubon Braves against the Steel Men in the evening. On the 8th, the Attack Lions will face the Aviation Apes, followed by the New Taipei Kings against the Dreamers. On the 9th, the Aviation Apes will play against the Fubon Braves, and the final game of the preseason will be between the New Taipei Kings and the Steel Men. Tickets are available for purchase to attend the games. This is the first time that professional basketball has come to Keelung, thanks to the efforts of Speaker Tong Tzu-wei of the Keelung City Council. Tong Tzu-wei pointed out that the general manager of the Steel Men, Gao Jing-yan, is a very experienced basketball person. He grew up watching games broadcasted by Gao Jing-yan and is honored to have been recommended by a friend to invite the Steel Men and PLG to hold their preseason games in Keelung. During the Chinese Professional Basketball League (CBA) era, the Keelung Municipal Sports Center was the home court for the Lucky Leopards. Tong Tzu-wei often went to the sports center to watch games during his elementary school days. Tong Tzu-wei said that basketball has always been popular in Keelung and has produced many national players, including the recent Asian Games gold medalist Yu Xiang-ping, who graduated from Mingchuan Junior High School. He hopes to invite professional teams to Keelung.

Tong Tzu-wei said that the long-term goal is for a professional team to settle in Keelung. The public is passionate about basketball, but they can only go to Taipei to watch games. If Keelung can attract people from other cities and counties to come watch games, it would have a positive impact on the development of sports in Keelung. In addition, the presence of a professional team can also help to activate Keelung's three-tier basketball system. Mayor Xie Guo-liang said that the city government will provide tickets to basketball teams from all levels of schools in Keelung and hopes that by watching professional basketball games, it will have a positive impact on the students' sports career.

Both he and Speaker Tong welcome professional teams to settle in Keelung as their home court city. As long as the professional basketball team is willing, the local community is optimistic and willing to cooperate.

Mayor Xie Guo-liang mentioned that the facilities of the sports center will be gradually improved over the years and stages. The end-of-year event will be held on December 23 at the municipal sports center, and they will continue to improve the sports center to attract high-quality events and activities to be held indoors for the public to participate in.
