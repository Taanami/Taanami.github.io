 Behind every jersey, there are many stories. In the summer of 2017, Fuming International was officially established and formed a team to participate in the first TGF Fire Cup. Through this tournament, they established a strong bond and over the years, Fuming International has grown stronger and established a place in the southern region. This year, they even won the TGF Fire Cup national championship. Let's listen to their story! (Photos provided by IG: joemystory_photo) Please continue reading

In the early days of Fuming International, team leader Song Xiangyue faced many challenges. The team lacked resources and recognition, and the more talented players tended to join established teams. As a result, they often found themselves in a situation where they had no players for the game, and even with enough manpower, they still lacked competitiveness.

When selecting players, the biggest principle is responsibility and agreement with Fuming International's team philosophy of "team first." Players with poor emotional management, multiple small actions on the court, or prone to conflicts are not welcome on the team. (Photos provided by IG: joemystory_photo) Please continue reading

The players of Fuming International come from all over the country, gathering elite college players from the southern region. Due to their different backgrounds, there may be conflicts in their playing styles. The only solution is to communicate and cooperate patiently, and through time, they gradually come to understand and play well together.

Talking about his experience leading the team, Song Xiangyue said, "Everyone who joined this team must have agreed with Fuming's principles and philosophy, so communication is relatively easy. They are also willing to listen to me, and compared to things on the court, I care more about their daily lives and their future." (Photos provided by IG: joemystory_photo)

Fuming International participated in the TGF Fire Cup intercollegiate tournament in 2017 and 2019, winning the national third place in 2019. After three years of intense training in the social group, they now have a strong lineup with experienced players. They returned to the TGF Fire Cup with a new look and were happy to defeat their strongest opponents and achieve the best results. "We are very fortunate that our core team has remained the same over the years, despite the high turnover rate of grassroots teams. This shows that our players all believe in this big family and are willing to go through difficulties and progress together." Team leader Song Xiangyue said.

In the process of becoming a better team, Fuming International has many benefactors. Song Xiangyue said, "I want to thank head coach Tao for always guiding me, my senior player Guanlin who gave me many pointers on and off the court, all the partners behind the scenes, and all the players who have followed and believed in Fuming. Lastly, my family who has always supported me. Without any one of them, none of this would be possible."

A good team must always strive for excellence and enjoy the joy that basketball brings. For Fuming International, winning the TGF Fire Cup is just a temporary goal. They cannot be satisfied with the current situation but must continue to push themselves to improve. Each role has its own stage, and leaving student basketball does not mean the end of the story. Fuming International was born for this. (Photos provided by IG: joemystory_photo)
