 Observation of the Hangzhou Asian Games basketball match: Chinese men's team loses to China by 20 points, simply due to the gap in physical talent.

Key players for the Chinese team: Abasi - 16 points, 5 rebounds (+2 plus/minus); Atenio - 21 points, 11 rebounds; Lin Tingqian - 9 points, 7 assists, 4 rebounds.

Key players for the Chinese team: Zhao Jiwei - 19 points, 7 assists (8 of 3-pointers made); Du Runwang - 17 points (8 of 3-pointers made); Zhang Zhenlin - 10 points, 11 rebounds (+25 plus/minus). The 20-point difference is simply due to the gap in physical talent. In the first 5 minutes of the first quarter and the third quarter, the Chinese team showed competitiveness and was able to keep up with China in terms of scoring. However, the players' fatigue eventually led to poor communication on defense, resulting in mismatches and openings for China to take advantage of. This also allowed China to conserve their energy and not exhaust themselves with a run-and-gun style of play. Photo/Chinese Olympic Committee

The Chinese team's scoring may falter, but it will not be because of Lin Tingqian's ball-handling. In fact, his control of the ball creates more space for his teammates to score. Players like Zhao Jiwei, Zhao Rui, and Hu Mingxuan had to take turns pressuring Lin Tingqian, leaving them unable to help defend other players. However, Lin Tingqian remained composed and did not make many mistakes due to the pressure. His few turnovers were a result of trying to force a play against the Chinese national team, who are more challenging opponents than those in the CBA league. Finding a balance between controlling the ball and attacking independently will be a new challenge for him, and I believe he will improve after the Asian Games.

Liu Zheng was also a key target for China's defense. He only made 2 out of 12 shots throughout the game, but this cannot be blamed on his shooting. The physical demands of defending against China are much greater than his role in the CBA league. He had to defend, help defend, and steal the ball during fast breaks, but he still could not get past China's defensive wall. Hopefully, the coaching staff can lighten his load and allow him to focus on the task at hand. This also tests the adaptability of the coaching staff. Photo/Chinese Olympic Committee

Abasi's offensive performance was on fire, and he had the physical advantage over Chinese players. His shooting was also on point, making him the player with the highest plus/minus on the team. However, he only played for 22 minutes, and I believe he deserves more playing time. He could even be used to defend the opponent's ball-handler, which would be a good choice. It's clear that Abasi wanted to keep the game close with his scoring. Perhaps he is better suited to disrupt the opponent's ball-handling.

In the first game of the group stage against Hong Kong, I did not follow why Atino received a technical foul and a disqualifying foul. However, against China, he was aggressive in the paint. He has clearly improved his layups from last season with the Guangzhou Long-Lions. What's even more commendable is that he didn't take too many unnecessary 3-pointers and focused on rebounding, defending in the paint, and even drawing fouls. His temper, which was often criticized, has also improved, but his lack of physicality prevented him from protecting the paint against players like Hu Jinqiu, Wang Zelin, and Zhang Zhenlin. This is just something he cannot control. At least he was able to contribute offensively in this game. In the last game of the group stage against Mongolia, the Chinese team should easily secure a victory and advance to the top 12. I hope that the Chinese team can quickly adjust their form during the group stage, and each player can play their role on the court. I also hope to see the coaching staff make more decisive and flexible adjustments, as playing it safe may make it more difficult for the starting lineup to keep up with the pace of the game.
