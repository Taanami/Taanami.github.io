  Brown and Celtics sign a 5-year $295.2 million contract extension, setting the record for the highest salary in NBA history

ESPN, a sports channel, reported today that Jaylen Brown, the Boston Celtics star, has reached an agreement with the team. Brown will receive a supermax contract extension worth $304 million over 5 years, setting a new record for the highest salary in NBA history.

Last season, Brown averaged a career-high of 26.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game. He played a crucial role in leading the Celtics to the Eastern Conference Finals, and he was selected to the All-Star Game and the All-NBA Second Team. As a result, he qualified for a 5-year maximum contract extension with the Celtics. According to Reuters, Brown was selected by the Celtics as the 3rd overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. He has been an All-Star twice, and his salary for the upcoming season will be $28.5 million. Starting in 2024, his salary will increase each year, averaging $60.8 million per year, doubling his current value.

Brown's supermax contract amount even surpasses Nikola Jokic's $276 million contract with the Denver Nuggets, making it the most lucrative contract in NBA history. Jokic has won the regular-season MVP award twice and led the Nuggets to their first NBA championship in the 2022-23 season, earning the NBA Finals MVP with an average of 30.2 points, 14 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in the series. However, Brown's position as the highest-paid player in the NBA may not last long, as his teammate Jayson Tatum will also be eligible to sign a supermax contract extension next year.

Why is the Celtics willing to invest heavily in the contract extension? According to ESPN Stats & Information research, Brown and Tatum formed a formidable duo last season, combining for an average of 56.7 points per game. They both scored over 30 points in 10 games, a feat achieved only by the "O'Bryant Connection" of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the past 30 years.

Additionally, according to Second Spectrum, 54% of Brown's scoring last season came from unassisted shots, and he averaged 1.15 points per possession when driving to the basket, setting a new career-high.
