 In the first pre-season game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Oklahoma City Thunder, two young power forwards, Chet Holmgren and Victor Wembanyama, made their NBA debut at the same time. The Thunder narrowly defeated the Spurs 122-121, with both of these highly-touted "unicorns" scoring over 20 points. Despite only playing for about half of the game, Holmgren and Wembanyama both made a significant impact on their respective teams. Holmgren provided a different threat for the Thunder with his ability to receive the ball, while Wembanyama showcased his ball-handling skills and his impressive wingspan on defense. In 16 minutes of play, Holmgren scored 21 points and grabbed 9 rebounds, shooting a perfect 2 for 2 from beyond the arc. Wembanyama played for 18 minutes and scored 20 points, along with 5 rebounds and 2 steals, shooting 2 for 5 from three-point range.
