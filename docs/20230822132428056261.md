 The arrival of the first overall pick of the Spurs, Admiral David Robinson

"He saved the entire team.

That's it." Red McCombs, the former owner of the Spurs, talked about how important David Robinson, also known as "The Admiral," was to the San Antonio Spurs before the 1999 NBA Finals.

In 1987, the Spurs were in trouble. Their home attendance had declined for eight consecutive seasons, with an average of 8,009 fans attending games during the 1986-87 season. They were not only the smallest market in the NBA, but San Antonio's television market was also ranked 42nd in the United States. The Spurs were at the bottom in terms of revenue, season ticket sales, and any other relevant indicators.

The main problem was the team's performance. Since the departure of their star player "The Iceman" George Gervin in 1985, the Spurs, who had reached the Western Conference Finals for two consecutive years in the early 1980s (and had made it to the playoffs for 10 consecutive years in the ABA and NBA), began to decline. Their winning percentage never exceeded fifty percent. "The team was dead," said McCombs.

"We are at a critical moment as a team," said Bob Bass, the general manager at the time. "We need to do something to bring the fans back to the arena."

If the Spurs hadn't been lucky enough to win the first overall pick in 1987, it is likely that the last professional sports team in San Antonio would not have stayed. McCombs recalled that NBA Commissioner David Stern told him in 1987 that the Spurs might not survive in San Antonio, and McCombs couldn't argue against it.

However, with the first overall pick, the Spurs rewrote the basketball history of South Texas. All hope in the Alamo City was placed on a seven-foot naval officer: David Robinson.

Typical NBA top picks usually start to shine in seventh or eighth grade, taller, faster, and better skilled than their peers. They dominate in high school, participate in high-level basketball camps, are pursued by college basketball coaches, make a name for themselves in college basketball, and become highly sought-after top picks surrounded by fans.

But in 1987, Robinson, the consensus top pick, didn't follow the typical path. He only had one year of high school basketball experience, didn't attend basketball camps, and when he entered college, he was only 6 feet 6 inches tall and weighed 175 pounds. He attended the United States Naval Academy, and his dream was only to become a naval officer. Professional basketball was not even on his wish list.

However, the maximum height limit for admission to the Naval Academy was 6 feet 6 inches, and Robinson grew seven inches after enrolling, instantly becoming the center of attention. He grew taller, but his coordination and speed remained outstanding. On the court, he was faster and taller than anyone else. "I didn't even notice how fast I was growing," said the 7-foot-1-inch Robinson. "I just noticed more and more people looking at me and saying, 'Man, you have to play basketball!'"

Approximately 5% of Naval Academy students continue to grow to 6 feet 8 inches after enrollment, but this height is still not enough to establish oneself in Division I college basketball. Moreover, the Naval Academy is not primarily a basketball school. Since 1933, no player from the Naval Academy has been selected to the All-American team.

However, having a 7-foot giant at the Naval Academy allowed the team, led by Robinson, to become a powerhouse in the NCAA. They not only returned to the NCAA Tournament's round of 64 for the first time since 1960 but also made it to the Elite Eight, breaking the school record. Robinson also grew into a super beast, receiving transfer invitations from many colleges and becoming the highly coveted future top pick in the NBA. Getting a multi-million-dollar contract in the professional league was not a problem.

But being at the Naval Academy raised questions about Robinson's basketball career. When asked about Robinson's weaknesses, Bob Ferry, the general manager of the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards), bluntly said, "Yes, his weakness is that he is in the Navy." Because Naval Academy graduates have to serve for five years, whether Robinson should transfer to another basketball powerhouse to solve his military service issue became a headline discussion at the time.

However, Robinson's father was a loyal navy man, which made Robinson determined to stay in the Navy, effectively blocking his path to the NBA. This caused a big controversy. However, the Navy found a win-win solution. Having Robinson stay not only proved the loyalty of a Navy man, but the perfect gentleman Robinson also became a ready-made advertising face for the military. However, his 7-foot stature still had limitations for some submarine missions. Therefore, the Navy adjusted Robinson's service period to two years, achieving a situation where everyone was happy.

Robinson could remain loyal, and the NBA could have the next generation of centers. For the Spurs, who were in dire straits both on and off the court at the time, having the opportunity to choose Robinson in the lottery was a godsend for the entire team. Robinson not only played the crucial center position in the NBA at the time but also excelled off the court. He scored 1320 on the SAT, majored in mathematics at the Naval Academy, and was talented in music and computers. Besides basketball, he also dabbled in gymnastics, bowling, golf, taekwondo, and tennis, and was known for being humble and easygoing.
