NBA veteran Paul Pierce recently shared about his summer training with Jayson Tatum, which was a great honor for him as he was able to get back in shape.

It's common for NBA players to train with legendary players during the offseason, and it's always a hot topic to see who trains with whom. The interaction between Celtics legends Paul Pierce and current star player Jayson Tatum during their recent gym session caught the attention of the public.

Pierce talked about the training session on Kevin Garnett's podcast, and revealed that it was set up by assistant coach Sam Cassell. He also mentioned that he was there to watch Tatum train and get some movement in, while also helping himself get back in shape. "Being there and watching him prepare also reminded me of how I used to prepare for the season. It was an honor for me to support and help him. He's now a top-five player in the league, and I've seen him grow from his rookie year to this stage."

Pierce compared Tatum to the top of the food chain, and himself as part of his support system. However, some American netizens were cynical, believing that Pierce training with Tatum might disrupt his training schedule, and some even joked that it seemed like Pierce was actually rehabilitating himself.
