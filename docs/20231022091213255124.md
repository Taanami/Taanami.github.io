Is the blowing secret trade a thing? Where will it go, Hawaii?

Little Li Flying Knife has hit the target, and each team has started their pre-season training camps, preparing for the season in full swing. "The Beard" James Harden, who had a falling out with team manager Daryl Morey, also shouted "trade me" during the summer, and it was rumored that he wanted to join the Clippers and team up with his hometown players Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and "Ninja Turtle" Russell Westbrook. However, the related trade has yet to materialize. Please continue reading for the media day before the 76ers' training camp, Harden was absent and only showed up two days later to join the team's training.

This has reignited rumors about Harden being traded. Does Harden want to leave, and does Morey want to keep him? It seems like a breakup is inevitable.

Even if the 76ers have a good lineup and are willing to put Harden on the trading table, the 34-year-old "Beard" may face a difficult situation with limited trade options. Harden's absence on media day and the first day of training camp was a way for him to express his desire to leave, but it was unnecessary.

"He wants to make the 76ers uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, ultimately, they don’t think they’ll get the best out of him and make a trade."[1] Both parties want to split, so why is the trade stuck? Let's discuss a few aspects below: Please continue reading

Objective factors are limiting, and the timing is not right. Currently, there are several teams in the league with championship potential, such as the Nuggets, Suns, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, Bucks, Celtics, Heat, and Knicks, who have all completed their roster during and after the Little Li trade. Harden missed the opportunity to join any of these teams, and also missed the trade deadline that saw CJ McCollum being sent to the Bucks. It is now much more difficult to trade to a "specific team" during the preseason training camp. This is not good timing.

The so-called "specific team" needs to be further divided. For Harden personally, as he enters the latter stage of his career, he has already won many individual awards and was selected as one of the top 75 players in NBA history. He even took a pay cut last year to allow the 76ers to strengthen their team, and he is only missing a championship ring. He would not want to join a team without the potential to win a championship. This limits his options to only 5-8 teams. Please continue reading

In addition, with the desire to return home to play, it seems that only the Lakers and Clippers are left as options.

Let's talk about the Lakers first. After the failure of the partnership with the "Ninja Turtle," their interest in the "Beard" should not be high.

The Lakers had a successful summer, keeping their original main lineup and strengthening their team with free agents. Christian Wood and Gabe Vincent, one inside and one outside, have improved the team's strength without any pain. Backup center Jaxson Hayes has explosive physicality and can be used as a secret weapon. On the wing, they have added Taurean Prince, who brings experience and immediate impact, and Cam Reddish, who has untapped potential.

As long as AD and LBJ are healthy, with the addition of D'Angelo Russell, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, and the new members mentioned above, they would have a good chance of beating the Nuggets 4-0.

The Lakers lack the incentive and motivation to trade for the "Beard." The status of the other teams mentioned above is not far from that of the Lakers. Would anyone be willing to dismantle a team that could potentially compete for the championship in the last 20-something days before the season begins, just to welcome Harden and lead the team? This is not a favorable situation.

The 76ers' dream of winning the championship and the "Beard's" personal value are in opposition to the 76ers' position. The newly crowned MVP "Pencil Brother" Joel Embiid still has four years left on his contract, while both main players Harden and Tobias Harris only have one year left. The main competitors in the East, such as the Bucks and Celtics, have adjusted their teams, and the Heat still have Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. It seems necessary for the 76ers to maintain their potential to compete for the championship if they want to keep Embiid. Trading Harden would require getting back players with similar capabilities, which is fundamentally different from the considerations of the Trail Blazers when they sent away Little Li.

Unlike Little Li, who still has four years left on his contract, the "Beard" did not sign an extension with the 76ers after last season and chose to exercise his player option of $35.6 million for the final year.

Therefore, this season is like a contract year for him, and next summer he will be a free agent. If the 76ers do not take this opportunity to trade him, regardless of any unexpected circumstances that may lower his trade value, or if the two parties are deadlocked until the end of the season and Harden leaves, it will be extremely detrimental to the team.

Since the relationship has deteriorated, and after witnessing the failure in handling the "Simmons saga," it ultimately led to the arrival of the "Beard" in Philadelphia.

Whether the blowing secret trade is feasible or not, it ultimately depends on Morey's decision, but it seems like the "Beard" has reached the final straw, and this time he is really going to blow away.
