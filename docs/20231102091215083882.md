#  當然這也不是給Lillard全責，因為他本身的表現還是非常優秀，總教練在一個個暫停以後也給了他很多機會去喘息，並且在最後一刻也是為他設計了一個關鍵性的進攻戰術，但是有時候比賽就是這麼殘酷，當你退下來的時候，對手就會找到你的另一處缺陷，不管這場比賽最後的結果如何，我們都必須肯定的是，這場比賽的勝利並不是靠著個別球員或是幸運才得來的，而是因為整個球隊的努力和拼搏。

 所以，同志們，公鹿隊的分析革命尚未成功，仍須努力，讓我們一起期待他們在未來的比賽中能夠再次展現出他們的實力和戰鬥精神！

The Milwaukee Bucks, who were the top seed in the league last season, faced the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs. It was a legendary matchup that had not happened in ten years, and the Heat managed to defeat the Bucks despite missing their starting player, Tyler Herro.

It was a moment that brought back the despair of the "Bubble" era for the Bucks. But let's continue reading about the new challenges ahead. If we want to say what the Bucks have learned from last year's defeat, it is that we will never give up easily.

During the off-season, the Bucks successfully acquired Damian Lillard in a battle with the Miami Heat. The team also made a decision to dismantle their old defensive system and focus on a more aggressive offense.

Lillard's offensive value may not have been as dominant as in previous games against the Atlanta Hawks, where he was limited to only 10 points for the fourth time in his career. However, in this game against the Miami Heat, although Lillard's performance on paper may not seem as strong as before, a closer look reveals that he still posed a big threat to the Heat.

In pick-and-roll situations, whether Lillard or Giannis Antetokounmpo initiates the offense, the Heat mostly double-teams, making it difficult for Lillard to get easy shots or driving opportunities. Lillard also knows when to pass to his teammates when facing the double-team, which can be seen in the game when Giannis gets the ball near the free throw line. Even though the Heat have shooters in the left and right corners, they still choose to double-team Giannis. And Giannis, after reading the defense, knows that the player guarding the paint, Bryant, has been pulled out, and Butler has been faked out with a big step, leaving the defender under the basket vulnerable. Although Lillard's ability to attract defenders and make the right pass is crucial, it is ultimately Giannis who executes the play with his strength and power.

If it were someone like Crowder, who has less individual ability, even if he attracts defenders, he won't be able to finish on his own, and will become a "passing point" for the second time. Therefore, it may not show in traditional statistics, but Lillard is actually activating the team's ball movement. As the saying goes, "children play from the three-point line, adults dominate the paint."

If we were to compare the two former and current head coaches, Mike Budenholzer and Adrian Griffin, the biggest difference would be in "discipline" and "efficiency". It's not to say that Griffin's team lacks discipline, but he allows his stars to have more freedom to try their favorite scoring methods.

The most obvious change is seen in the team's sixth man, Bobby Portis. Under Budenholzer's coaching, he relied on his excellent outside shooting and positioned himself in the corners for catch-and-shoot opportunities or to set screens and then pop out to the three-point line. This made his job very simple and efficient, and his overall statistics improved significantly, earning him a spot in the top three for the Sixth Man of the Year award.

This change is not necessarily a bad thing, but it places too much emphasis on efficiency, causing the team to struggle when facing adversity, forgetting the players' individual strengths, and ultimately leading to self-destruction. In this game against the Heat, Portis perfectly demonstrated his agility and skill in the low post, taking advantage of the lack of experienced big men in the paint for the young Heat players, and using his size to overpower them. Defensively, he was also active in pressuring the offense, often seen using his body to trap opponents and force turnovers, then initiating fast breaks.

In the final quarter, the team let their guard down and almost blew the game. When the lead reached over 20 points, it was evident that the players were complacent. At the same time, the Heat picked up the pace and made a furious comeback, forcing the coach to quickly put the starters back in to secure the win. The team's lack of rhythm on offense was one of the reasons for the Heat's comeback. Lillard's ball-handling and initiating were reduced, and he was relegated to a weak-side corner shooter. The other four players kept passing the ball around the perimeter, which was neither effective nor threatening. This allowed the Heat to get more steals and score on fast breaks. Meanwhile, Herro, who has been in the center of trade rumors all summer, was on fire, making all kinds of mid-range jumpers and taking advantage of our weak backcourt defense and Lopez's flaws.

Of course, this is not to blame Lillard. His performance was still excellent, and the coach gave him plenty of rest during timeouts. He even designed a crucial play for him in the final seconds. But sometimes, that's just how cruel the game can be. When you take a break, the opponent finds another one of your weaknesses. Regardless of the outcome of this game, we must acknowledge that the victory was not achieved through individual players or luck, but through the team's efforts and resilience.

So, comrades, the Bucks' analysis revolution has not succeeded yet, and we still need to work hard. Let's look forward to their future games, where they will once again show their strength and fighting spirit!
