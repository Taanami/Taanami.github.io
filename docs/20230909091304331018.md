 NBA player Trey Murphy injured his meniscus during a training session and will need further evaluation to determine if surgery is necessary. There are typically two ways to treat a meniscus injury: surgery, which requires several months of recovery, or non-surgical treatment, which has a shorter timeline of about 6-8 weeks and would only cause him to miss the first few weeks of the season. Murphy averaged 14.5 points and 3.6 rebounds per game last season, with a 40% three-point shooting percentage and a 90% free-throw shooting percentage. He also ranked fifth in the league for catch-and-shoot three-pointers made, making him a valuable young player for the Pelicans team.
