 After leading the Kaohsiung 17 Live Iron and Steel Man team in the previous season and igniting the "Lin Crazy" phenomenon in PLG, Jeremy Lin officially joined the New Taipei Kings team today, wearing the number 7 jersey. In the new season, he will be a member of the Kings' guard and will not expect to play against his former teammates from the Iron and Steel Man team on the court. After announcing his joining the Kings last Thursday, Lin held a press conference and practice at the New Taipei Sports Center today. Regarding his decision to leave the Iron and Steel Man team and join the Kings as a free agent, he said, "4 or 5 teammates from the Iron and Steel Man team sent me messages to congratulate me and are looking forward to playing against me. The experience with the Iron and Steel Man team last year will always be remembered, but playing against them is not fun for me, so I don't expect to play against them." After joining the Iron and Steel Man team last year, Jeremy Lin took on the role of team leader and led the team to a strong finish in the second half of the season. He emphasized that he will bring the same leadership qualities to the Kings. "I believe it is important to unite the team. My playing style and role will be different in different teams, but the most important thing is to unite the team. This is the first goal as a guard." Speaking of his new teammates, Jeremy Lin is looking forward to working with foreign players Manny Harris and Marcus Thornton. He also specifically mentioned Kings guard Lee Kai-Yan, "I think Kai-Yan has not reached his full potential yet. His abilities are much better than what he has shown." The Kings will face the Dreamers and Iron and Steel Man teams in the PLG preseason games on October 7-9. Whether he will make his debut in the first public game after joining the team, Jeremy Lin emphasized that he will follow the coach's arrangements. "I'm not sure if I will play in the preseason game, it depends on the coach. I just arrived, so I can't guarantee that I won't play or how much playing time I will get."
