  LeBron James, the NBA scoring king, is set to challenge the unprecedented 40,000-point milestone in the NBA.

In the game on the 8th, Taiwan time, LeBron James of the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers scored 38 points, bringing his career total to 38,390 points, surpassing the record of 38,387 points set by "Sky Hook" Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, becoming the all-time leading scorer in NBA history.

As of now, the top five scorers in NBA history are LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, and Michael Jordan, with LeBron James being the only active player. LeBron James joined the NBA in the 2003-04 season at the age of 19. He has played 1,410 games over 21 seasons, achieving the feat of becoming the scoring king.

His career average points per game is 27.2 points. When comparing the average points per game in each season, the highest average occurred in the 2005-06 season, with an average of 31.4 points per game. The lowest average points per game was in his first year in the NBA, with an average of 20.9 points per game. However, except for the first year, his average points per game in other seasons have never been below 25 points.

Because LeBron James is still an active player, his points in each game will continue to raise the highest record of total points in the NBA. He currently has a gap of 1,610 points to reach the 40,000-point milestone.

Let's calculate based on his past average scoring record to see how many more games he needs to reach 40,000 points.

Looking at the past three seasons, where he played at least 45 games per season (the lowest in his career), regardless of the above calculation, as long as he maintains his health, LeBron James is likely to achieve the milestone of 40,000 total points in the next season (2024-25) at the slowest.
