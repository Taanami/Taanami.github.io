  2023 TGF World Firefighting Continuation Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview - Tong Hong Freezing

Tong Hong Freezing, who won the national championship in the inter-school group at the 2020 Continuation Cup, returned to the tournament this year as part of the senior group. They advanced to the national level as the champions of the southern region and ultimately finished as national runners-up. This year's achievement will undoubtedly make Tong Hong Freezing even stronger! After three years, Tong Hong Freezing has made significant improvements in team unity and strength. Let's hear their story!

Tong Hong Freezing was founded in 2019 by team leader Chen Wei-hao. Chen Wei-hao admitted that the team had a smooth start during the early days of its establishment. At that time, Tong Hong Freezing only focused on high school basketball. In terms of high school basketball, Tong Hong Freezing was unbeatable, with very few losses. However, the real challenge came when they stepped out of their comfort zone and entered the social group competition. The intensity in the social group was much higher than in the high school group. It was not enough to rely solely on talented high school players to succeed. In the beginning, they faced numerous obstacles, but after two to three years of college experience, the players' physical fitness improved significantly, and they became more adaptable to high-intensity games. They gradually entered a better phase.

The primary requirement for recruiting players for Tong Hong Freezing is good character, while basketball skills are considered secondary. Players represent not only themselves but also the team when they step onto the court. In recent years, team leader Chen Wei-hao has actively recruited players to join the Tong Hong Freezing family. Since the core members graduated from high school and went their separate ways, they had to search for new talents in the southern region to enhance the team's strength.

Leading a good team is not just about managing people, but more importantly, it's about how to lead with heart. To cultivate a player in the long run, one must pay attention to this aspect. Chen Wei-hao said, "Most of the players have been with me since high school, and it has been three or four years now. We also have new blood joining. I often chat with the players and gather together during private training sessions. I provide them with a stage to showcase their talents. Whenever the team achieves good results, we generously reward the players. This builds their confidence, both on and off the court. Everyone in the Tong Hong family feels proud and honored."

"My competitiveness is strong, and I want to lead a team that prioritizes teamwork and winning. I don't want to recruit mercenaries just to win a few tournaments and then disband. Because we share a common dream and goal, we prepare for every game to ensure the team's victory. Every member of Tong Hong has confidence in the team's brand," Chen Wei-hao said. 

Looking back at the Continuation Cup three years ago, Tong Hong Freezing first won the championship in the southern region by defeating Fu Wei Township in a thrilling game. They then went on to win the national championship by defeating CHH with a fast break play by Lin Yu-sheng. When Tong Hong Freezing returned to the tournament this year, all the crazy memories from that year rushed back. Chen Wei-hao believes that these memories will forever remain in the hearts of the players.

Tong Hong Freezing has returned to the Continuation Cup this year, and Chen Wei-hao expressed his heartfelt emotions, saying, "It's truly touching to be back here, experiencing that familiar feeling. The memories left by the Continuation Cup are overwhelming, and I feel very moved. Even though we are no longer high school students, the games in the college senior group are still filled with passion. The Continuation Cup is an important stage for the players."

This year, Tong Hong Freezing defeated their strong rivals, Fu Ming International, in the championship game of the southern region. Unfortunately, they couldn't defeat Fu Ming International again in the national championship game. However, as the book "Leadership: Leading with Heart" says, "When we win a game, it doesn't mean that everything is right. Conversely, when we lose a game, it doesn't mean that everything is wrong. In fact, sometimes failure can be a kind of victory." Chen Wei-hao also expressed, "I don't feel ashamed of this defeat. It will make us stronger, and next time we meet in the same place, it won't be that simple."

On Chen Wei-hao's journey to fulfilling his dream, the person he is most grateful for is his father. When he wanted to establish the team, his father and a few good friends supported him without hesitation, allowing him to move forward without worries. He also hopes that the players can study the game and soar high with their basketball skills. Finally, Chen Wei-hao wants to say to the players of Tong Hong Freezing, "Thank you for your hard work in the Continuation Cup! Learn from the lessons of the national championship game's defeat and reclaim that feeling of not being satisfied. I appreciate your participation and thank you for playing for Tong Hong. I am sincerely proud of all of you. I want to win more than anyone else, but there are some things on the court that we, as players, cannot resist. All we can do is fight back with goals and defeat those who doubt us. I hope you all enjoy the atmosphere of playing basketball and the glory of being a Tong Hong player. Let's not allow it next year and bring back our championship!"
