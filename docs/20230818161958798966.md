#The NBA Spurs won the No 
 The NBA Spurs won the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft lottery and are likely to select the highly-touted "French monster" Victor Wembanyama. If they can successfully sign him, it would be the third time in franchise history that they acquire a game-changing big man.

The NBA draft lottery is open to the 14 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs this season. The Detroit Pistons, Houston Rockets, and San Antonio Spurs, with the worst regular-season records, had the highest chance of winning the No. 1 pick, each with a 14.0% probability.

Represented by team executive Peter J. Holt, the Spurs secured the top pick, while the Charlotte Hornets and Portland Trail Blazers won the second and third picks, respectively. The fourth pick belongs to the Rockets.

With the No. 1 pick, the Spurs are almost certain to select one of the most anticipated rookies in NBA history, 19-year-old French center Victor Wembanyama, who stands at 7 feet 3 inches (221 cm). It is expected that he will have an immediate impact in the NBA. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, "He is an incredible young man, only 19 years old, but clearly a generational big man." This is the Spurs' third time winning the draft lottery. The previous two times they used the No. 1 pick to select players who greatly contributed to the team's success.

In 1987, the Spurs drafted "The Admiral" David Robinson, and in 1997, they selected "The Big Fundamental" Tim Duncan. Both players were crucial in helping the team win five championships under current head coach Gregg Popovich. The Spurs finished this season with a record of 22 wins and 60 losses, tied for second-worst in the league.

Popovich has had great success in the past with international players like Manu Ginobili from Argentina and Tony Parker from France. Now, he hopes to build a new "Spurs dynasty" with Wembanyama. The remaining picks from 5th to 14th are the Pistons, Magic, Indiana Pacers, Washington Wizards, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks, Magic (again), Oklahoma City Thunder, Toronto Raptors, and New Orleans Pelicans.
