 The Coexistence of the 2023 World Cup and the Pressure of the World Cup: Steve Kerr's Inheritance and Reflection

August 24th was a significant day for the head coach of the USA team, Steve Kerr.

Because of the jersey number Kobe Bryant carried throughout his 20-year NBA career, basketball fans around the world associate August 24th with Kobe Bryant Day. This day was also important for the USA team as they had their first game of the 2023 FIBA World Cup.

Continue reading In the official press conference before their opening game against New Zealand on August 26th, Steve Kerr and Jalen Brunson were interviewed about their first impressions of the Philippines and the challenges they were about to face. However, August 24th held even more significance for Kerr personally.

"August 24th is my mother's birthday, that's what stands out to me the most about this day." When asked about his memories of Kobe Bryant during the press conference, he replied with a smile.

Continue reading He humorously added, "Happy birthday, Mom, but I'm sure she's not watching." Kerr reflected on his memories of Kobe, stating, "I played against him as a player, and after I began coaching in the later stages of Kobe's career, I had some great memories with him. It was a tremendous privilege to be on the court with one of the greatest players in NBA history, and competing against him was extraordinary. Even today, we still remember Kobe and the significance he had for all of us and the entire league."

The USA team's journey in the FIBA World Cup is in full swing, and their mission is to reclaim the world championship title after finishing in seventh place in 2019, the second-worst result in USA basketball history.

However, after losing to Lithuania and Germany in the semifinals, it was confirmed that the USA would not be able to win the gold medal this time. Photo source: Getty Images. Kerr, who took over as the head coach of the USA team this year, previously talked about his experience as an assistant coach to Gregg Popovich in 2019 and 2021, as well as the impact it had on him as the head coach of the national team for the first time. Continue reading Kerr praised the team, saying, "That experience really dictated how we selected this team. We wanted players who we believed could come together as a team in a short amount of time. We have a great group of players who are connected to each other, who can pass the ball, and who are truly enjoying this experience." "Being an assistant coach to Gregg Popovich in 2019 and 2021 was a really good experience for me because you get to feel how to build a team in six weeks, which is completely different from the NBA. You can't build continuity or accumulate a lot of experience to build a team. You can only do it like this..." At this point, Kerr snapped his fingers, indicating the need to efficiently complete the task in a short amount of time.

Kerr also admitted that his team learned some valuable lessons in the early stages. The USA team won all five warm-up games against Puerto Rico (117-74), Slovenia (92-62), Spain (98-88), Greece (108-86), and Germany (99-91).

"The most important thing is to be familiar with FIBA rules and stay united. Throughout this process, we faced strong opponents, and we have confidence, but we also faced some setbacks. Spain and Germany challenged us, and these experiences have helped us because we know how excellent these teams are," Kerr praised the Germany and Spain teams that pushed them to their limits during the warm-up games.

For the USA, anything other than a gold medal is considered a failure, but USA team point guard Jalen Brunson does not shy away from the challenge.

"For me personally, there's no such thing as 'pressure'," the New York Knicks player replied when asked about pressure. "I understand that as long as I give my all in my game, there's no such thing as pressure. There are moments and situations that require facing tough odds, but my confidence comes from my professional ethics. As long as I continue to work hard and understand that I strive for improvement every day, there's no pressure. I think for the team, in moments like that, we heavily rely on each other."

Brunson analyzed it this way. Kerr, who won a gold medal in the FIBA World Cup in 1986, also talked about the weight of responsibility. Kerr explained, "Pressure is self-imposed. We all love what we do, I love coaching, and I also love the pressure or what we call competition. Being a competitor also means accepting the possibility of defeat, that's what the game is about, there's winning and losing." He also added, "Effort, method, and chemistry are key. I love being part of a team, I love what we're doing at this moment, trying to build something and taking risks. Of course, the charm of sports is that there's no risk to life. But we will compete, we will give our all, we will strive for glory, and we also know that if we fail, we may face criticism, and we accept that." "But our mindset is that this is a very enjoyable thing, we're extremely fortunate to be a part of all this, to compete, and when we look back on all this in the future, we know that we've given it our all. As I said, we're working hard, we want to win, but whatever happens, happens, and we will accept it because that's part of the game."
