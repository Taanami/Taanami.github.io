  T1 League's handsome foreign player Flyck scored 31 points to lead the T1 League defending champion New Taipei Citibank Special Forces to a victory over the T1 League's first-year champion Kaohsiung Family Mart Sea Gods. Together with "Black Panther" Abasi, who scored 48 points, they helped the team maintain their undefeated home record and win the opening game against Tainan Taiwan Steel Hawks yesterday.

Although they had a 10-point lead at 18:10, it quickly disappeared as the Sea Gods, led by Brockman, went on a 7-0 run to take a 21-20 lead. In the second quarter, Tang Wei-jie came off the bench and Lu Wei-ting scored two consecutive baskets to help the Sea Gods take a 28-21 lead. It wasn't until 7 minutes and 47 seconds into the quarter that Flyck made his first three-pointer for the Special Forces. However, the Sea Gods failed to score in the last 3 minutes, allowing the Special Forces to tie the game at 34-34 with a free throw from their foreign player, Jieka, and a three-pointer from Abasi. Abasi's 11 points were the only double-digit scorer in the first half, while Brockman had 8 points and 3 assists for the Sea Gods, and Kusas had 7 points and 12 rebounds.

In the third quarter, Tien Jie-long hit a three-pointer to start the quarter with a 5-0 run for the Special Forces, expanding their lead to 44-34. Flyck then made a "3-point play" and scored another 4 points, scoring a total of 7 consecutive points to extend the lead to 53-36. It wasn't until 7:17 that Ailun scored his second basket of the quarter for the Sea Gods. Although Brockman hit a buzzer-beating shot, the Special Forces still led 70-53 at the end of the third quarter. With a comfortable lead, Flyck continued to impress in the fourth quarter with a dunk show. The Sea Gods tried to catch up in the end, narrowing the gap to single digits, but Flyck's basket with 1 minute and 18 seconds left secured the Special Forces' victory with a final score of 86-77.
