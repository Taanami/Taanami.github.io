Special correspondent Ji Xiangru/ Photo - In the crucial game for the top spot in the group at the Asian Games men's basketball tournament in Hangzhou, although the Chinese team was able to compete with the host's tall lineup on the inside, their defense on the perimeter faltered as they allowed the Chinese team to score 15 three-pointers, resulting in a final score of 69:89, their first loss of the tournament. In order to secure the second spot in the group, the Chinese team will have to defeat Mongolia in their final group game. Team captain Zeng Wendong declared a "must-win" order, and head coach Sun Maosen pointed out the key factors.

Sun Maosen mentioned that the Chinese team faced a significant height disadvantage against their opponents today. Throughout the entire game, the Chinese team focused on protecting the paint, but they missed out on many defensive rebounds, allowing the host team to grab offensive rebounds and convert them into outside shots. He added, "Our biggest problem was that every one of us was being guarded closely on offense, making it difficult to create good opportunities." Despite losing by 20 points, Sun Maosen still praised the Chinese team's fighting spirit, but noted that there is room for improvement in their defensive communication and rotations.

16 teams are participating in the Asian Games basketball tournament, divided into 4 groups in the preliminary round. The group winners will directly advance to the quarter-finals, while the second and third place teams will compete in a crossover game for the remaining 4 spots in the quarter-finals. The Chinese team will face Mongolia in their final group game, and a win will secure their spot as the second place team in the group.

The Chinese team does not have much knowledge about their opponents from Mongolia, but they have studied their previous game against China. Sun Maosen believes that their opponents will be highly energetic and have a positive attitude in the next game. Despite their height disadvantage in today's game, the Chinese team may have an advantage in the next game against Mongolia. In order to have a chance to execute their strong suit of fast break offense, the Chinese team must focus on securing rebounds. Mongolia faced Hong Kong at the same time today and suffered their second consecutive loss with a final score of 64:69, allowing Hong Kong, who is filling in for Lebanon in the Asian Games, to secure their first win. Currently, both China and Hong Kong have a record of 1 win and 1 loss. Based on their strength, it will be difficult for Hong Kong to defeat the host in their final game, which means that the Chinese team, who previously defeated Hong Kong, has a high chance of securing the second spot in the group.
