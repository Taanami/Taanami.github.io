T1 League held a media gathering for the new season today, with Qian Weijuan (holding the microphone).

T1 League addressed the recent reports of basketball players being involved in match-fixing and gambling cases in the domestic basketball scene. T1 League president Qian Weijuan expressed her frustration in her dual roles. As a senior in the basketball community, she is very angry about the situation. As the president of T1 League, she has to not only handle service, game affairs, and business matters, but also take on a supervisory role. She is currently in close contact with the teams, hoping to put an end to such situations. SBL player Wu Jiyin, who was involved in match-fixing and gambling, was summoned by the district prosecutor and released on bail. The Chinese Basketball Association also held a disciplinary committee meeting yesterday, announcing the revocation of Wu Jiyin's player registration. In the future, CBA teams are not allowed to employ him, and the decision will also be communicated to the Chinese Professional Basketball League for follow-up action.

Regarding Wu Jiyin, who had previously played for T1 team, Qian Weijuan said that she has two different perspectives. First, as a senior in the basketball community, she is very angry because it takes a lot of effort from many people to bring the basketball scene to where it is today.

As for her role as T1 League president, Qian Weijuan emphasized the role of the league. Apart from providing services, handling game affairs and business matters, she also has to stand in a supervisory position to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. "We have measures in place, such as taking classes with legal personnel and consultants. Based on our past experience in baseball, this is the biggest harm. Our loyal fans are standing by us, and we cannot break their hearts. The league's regulations have also been established, and there is no room for such incidents. We are also in constant communication with the teams, closely monitoring any large sum of money involved. At the moment, these are just rumors." Qian Weijuan concluded with a heartfelt message, saying that in her conversations with the players these past two days, she reminded them to cherish themselves, as it is currently the best era for Taiwanese basketball. Especially with more choices for college players, "We don't know what the future holds, but we have to start by doing our own best, and the environment will naturally improve."
