The Boston Celtics, who were down 0-3 in the Eastern Conference Finals, managed to secure a narrow 104-103 victory against the Miami Heat in Game 6 on September 28. This win allowed the Celtics to tie the series at 3-3, giving them a chance to make history.

After losing the first three games of the series, the Miami Heat were leading 3-2 going into Game 6. However, the Celtics fought back and took the lead in the first quarter with a score of 34-29. They continued to maintain their lead throughout the game, despite the Heat's efforts to close the gap.

In the second quarter, the Celtics extended their lead to double digits at 52-41. The Heat made a comeback and reduced the deficit to only four points, but the Celtics still led 57-53 at halftime. The key to the Celtics' lead was their better shooting percentage, with 51.3% compared to the Heat's 38.3%.

In the second half, the Heat managed to narrow the gap to just two points at one point, but the Celtics responded with a series of successful plays to regain a comfortable lead. In the fourth quarter, the Heat made a strong comeback and briefly took the lead at 83-82. However, the Celtics quickly regained control and secured an 8-0 run to lead 90-83.

With just three seconds left in the game, Jimmy Butler of the Heat made three free throws to give his team a one-point lead. However, Derrick White of the Celtics made a crucial shot before the buzzer, sealing the victory for the Celtics.

No team in NBA playoff history has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit to win a series. But the Celtics have managed to win three consecutive games after being down 0-3, tying the series at 3-3. If they win Game 7 at home on September 30, they will create history.
