  PLG accuses Taishin of lack of sincerity in negotiations, Hsinchu Lions officially files a lawsuit

Hsinchu Lions respects the outcome of the first mediation meeting held by the Chinese Basketball Association on the 4th and looks forward to Taishin Lions proposing negotiation conditions.

However, today the Hsinchu Lions received a response from Taishin Lions rejecting the negotiations and choosing to hide behind the players to evade responsibility. This clearly goes against the conclusion of the meeting on that day, so the Hsinchu Lions officially filed a lawsuit this afternoon. Taishin Lions stated that they refuse to negotiate with the Lions as a team and only agree to Lin Bingsheng facing the contract dispute alone. The Lions believe that this action does not comply with the consensus reached at the first mediation meeting. Moreover, Lin Bingsheng was absent from the meeting without reason, and Taishin Lions have been inconsistent in their attitude, showing no sincerity in negotiations. Therefore, this afternoon, the Hsinchu Lions, represented by co-founder Hu Longzhi and board representative Lin Xianer, accompanied by the appointed legal team, filed a civil lawsuit against Lin Bingsheng at the Taipei District Court, seeking high compensation for the losses incurred by the team. As for Taishin Lions, the Lions seek joint compensation based on joint tort and violation of Article 25 of the Fair Trade Act, claiming unfair competition.

In addition, a complaint has also been filed with the Fair Trade Commission regarding Taishin Lions.
