RegBulls refers to BedBull, the Chicago Bulls in the Regular Season. According to most season predictions, we may not have to consider the playoffs, so we will take a different approach.

In the first game at home, the Bulls gave a refreshing performance in the first half, but were completely overshadowed by the Thunder on both ends of the court in the second half. After the game, reports surfaced of a team meeting with only players present. Let's review this game in the following categories.

Keep reading for Stats: Last season, the Bulls had the lowest three-point attempts per game at 28.9, but in this game, they attempted 42 shots. Although they only made 12 and had a dismal shooting percentage, it at least shows that the team is making progress in improving their shot distribution.

Good: The Bulls had more offensive rebounds and steals than the Thunder, giving them many more shot opportunities.

Bad: The Thunder's Drive and Kick strategy completely tore apart the Bulls' defense in the second half, leading to their hot shooting and a bigger lead. Was this a result of poor defensive strategy?

Player: Torrey Craig's presence brings more versatility to the Bulls' lineup. He can potentially be paired with the young wings to create bold lineups.

Moment: Three noteworthy moments from the game: Patrick Williams' first basket, DeMar DeRozan's first three-pointer, and Andre Drummond's crossover on Chet Holmgren for a layup.

Next: The Bulls will face the Toronto Raptors at home, who are missing Fred VanVleet and have a new coach, Darko Rajakovic. Despite not tanking, the Raptors have managed to maintain competitiveness in the East with players like Scottie Barnes, who is on the rise, and Dennis Schroder, the World Cup MVP.
