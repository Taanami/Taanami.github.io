Anthony Davis.

In an interview on The Athletic NBA Show podcast, Jeanie Buss, owner of the Los Angeles Lakers, discussed the team's performance both on and off the court in recent seasons. She also mentioned the changes in NBA ownership and the HBO series "Winning Time," as well as her interactions with celebrities in Los Angeles. During the conversation, Buss specifically mentioned Anthony Davis and emphasized that he is the best player in the league when he's healthy.

AD's health has been a major concern and criticism. Last season, he missed 20 consecutive games, during which the Lakers' winning percentage dropped below 50%. However, with the help of new additions to the team, they were able to reach the Western Conference Finals after Davis returned from injury. This season, Davis signed a contract extension worth $186 million for three years, ensuring that he will remain with the team at least until 2028. Lakers' general manager, Rob Pelinka, even referred to Davis as the core of their core.

"This offseason, we made moves to seek improvement in every aspect of the team, but re-signing AD was the most essential part of all our operations. It helps us maintain the strength of our roster. He is the foundation of our team, and we are very excited to continue working with AD," added Pelinka.
