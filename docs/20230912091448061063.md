 Aggressive Leadership Traits: Dennis Schroder and Germany's Unfinished Mission

The preparations for the previous EuroBasket tournament have evidently had an impact on the present.

Maxi Kleber, wanting to fully prepare for the NBA season, declined to represent the national team, which drew public criticism from Dennis Schroder at the time.

A year later, despite Kleber expressing his desire to participate, the remarks made by the "leader" of the German national team still left him feeling hurt and unwelcome, leading him to not communicate his intentions to national team head coach Gordon Herbert. Read on to learn more about Germany's past performances in the FIBA World Cup, as well as the best results achieved by the national team.

Germany has participated in the World Cup a total of seven times, but they have only advanced to the quarterfinals twice, with their best result being a bronze medal in 2002.

In that tournament, Dirk Nowitzki performed exceptionally well with 24 points and 11 rebounds, but Germany was still defeated by Argentina in the semifinals.

In the battle for third place, Nowitzki once again showcased his excellence with 29 points, leading Germany to victory against New Zealand.

Four years ago, Germany ambitiously competed in the FIBA World Cup but suffered a setback as they were eliminated by the Dominican Republic in the first round. Continue reading to learn about Germany's path to qualification for this year's World Cup.

They only lost one game in the first stage (5 wins, 1 loss), which was against Estonia. In the second part of the qualifiers, they continued to dominate and finished with a total score of 10-2, securing first place.

Perhaps it sounds somewhat critical, but the current team's leader seems a bit misnamed due to his own behavior, as leadership is earned through the recognition of others rather than one's own perception.

Nevertheless, Dennis Schroder is undoubtedly the most important player. Without his outstanding performance in the previous World Cup, Germany wouldn't have been able to secure the bronze medal.

While on the court, there may not be any issues, but when an important player in the lineup decides not to support the national team due to the leader's public statements, it becomes a significant problem.

Regardless, Schroder is here while Kleber is not, and this is the ideal moment to conclude this story.

In the previous season, Schroder played in 66 NBA games for the Los Angeles Lakers, averaging 12.6 points and 4.5 assists per game. Additionally, the Wagner brothers have already proven themselves to be reliable. Last year, Schroder and Franz Wagner were bronze medalists in the EuroCup. Moritz Wagner couldn't participate due to injury, but he showcased an excellent performance at the Olympics two years ago. Johannes Thiemann and Johannes Voigtmann, as experienced European league players, should not be overlooked, and Isaac Bonga can defend all positions from point guard to center.

All three players are a threat from the perimeter. If we add Daniel Theis' size and abilities in the paint, it won't be easy for opponents to gain an advantage against Germany inside the key.

Maodo Lo in the backcourt will serve as a backup plan when Schroder is off the court, as he has proven his scoring ability multiple times.

However, the most anticipated C&S player is Andreas Obst. Despite missing most of last season due to injury, Obst is now healthy and ready to bring his strongest weapon to the national team, which is three-point shooting.

In this aspect, he is undoubtedly one of the most outstanding players in the European leagues. Head Coach Gordon Herbert is the German national team's head coach. He is of Canadian descent and has led multiple professional teams throughout his illustrious career, including three terms with Frankfurt. He led them to win the German Bundesliga title in 2004 and received the Coach of the Year award in 2016 representing the same team. Additionally, Frankfurt lifted the FIBA Europe Cup trophy that season. He has also worked with the Canadian coaching staff and served as an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors, as well as the coach of the Georgian national men's basketball team. He took on the role of head coach for the German national team in 2021. In the first important game, he led "Die Mannschaft" to their first medal in the EuroBasket tournament in 17 years.

Currently undefeated in the preliminary stage, they have a strong chance of winning the gold medal. We will soon find out if this team can achieve great results in this World Cup.
