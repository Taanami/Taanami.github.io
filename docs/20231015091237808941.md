Introduction Despite being swept by the eventual champions, the Nuggets, in a 4-1 series in the playoffs, the Timberwolves' partnership of Towns and Gobert has been a rollercoaster ride for fans.

While this rough road may seem like a setback for the team's future, considering the injuries and other factors, there were still some bright spots in the regular season, play-in tournament, and first round of the playoffs. In this article, the author will not only explore the hottest topics, such as Edwards' rise, the collaboration of the Twin Towers, and the team's reinforcements and strategies for the new season, but also discuss the additions and departures of players.

(In) This season, there is ample room for the main team to familiarize themselves with each other.

The Timberwolves ranked 23rd in offensive efficiency in the league this season, but their defensive efficiency was in the top 10.

New addition Gobert was not able to fully adapt to D'Angelo Russell's passes, leading to fluctuations in offensive efficiency. In addition, Towns' absence due to injury for a third of the season inevitably resulted in a decline in offensive efficiency.

Although Towns is often criticized for being a soft center, his offensive contributions are crucial to the team's tactics. His outside shooting creates more space for the team's offense and is especially useful in fast breaks.

However, Towns' three-point shooting has been inconsistent, and the Twin Towers experiment has made it difficult for the two centers to coexist, resulting in some confusion in their previously emphasized fast-paced, space-spreading playstyle. However, as the season progressed, Conley and Gobert's chemistry from their time with the Jazz resurfaced, Edwards could explode on offense at any moment, and the stellar performance of the "third tower" Naz Reid all showed that while there is still room for improvement in their offensive performance, the team's early season instability has become more stable.

Relying on other players' defense Despite the criticism of moving Towns to the power forward position, the previous management hoped that Gobert could make up for his defensive shortcomings, but Gobert's underestimated rim-protecting ability was showcased in the play-in tournament and playoffs. For example, in a game against the Thunder, the collaboration between Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Gobert limited their opponent's star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's mid-range scoring and passing abilities.

In their matchup against the Nuggets, Gobert's defense against Jokic was extremely difficult, limiting their opponent's performance and shooting efficiency.

In addition, starting players Edwards, McDaniels, and bench players Kyle Anderson, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and Taurean Prince all have the size and lateral quickness to play multiple positions on defense, showing that the Timberwolves have a solid foundation on defense.

Therefore, the improvement in the Timberwolves' performance in last season's playoffs (especially on defense) shows the potential for progress.

This season's weakness The Timberwolves' biggest problem is their "twin towers" partnership, which was seen in last season's inability to complement each other and will directly affect the team's future development. Even in this preseason, they are still trying to play Towns and Reid at the power forward position and Gobert at the center position in their "twin towers" experiment. While it may seem like there has been some improvement on the offensive end, their lack of lateral quickness on defense compared to traditional power forwards is evident in their individual defense, help defense, and closeouts. Even if the defense at other positions is outstanding, a small hole can lead to overall defensive breakdowns. On the offensive end, with Reid and Gobert on the court at the same time, they are limited to being shooters, not being able to fully utilize their potential.

The idealized effect of the Twin Towers may seem great, but it is difficult to achieve in reality. As the team continues to grow and develop, the collaboration and future of the Twin Towers will be the most important factor to consider.

Key variable The Timberwolves' biggest challenge is the collaboration of the "twin towers." Last season, their partnership was not effective, and this will directly impact the team's future development.

Even in this preseason, they are still attempting to play Towns and Reid at the power forward position and Gobert at the center position in their "twin towers" experiment. While there has been some improvement on the offensive end, their lack of lateral quickness compared to traditional power forwards is evident in their individual defense, help defense, and closeouts.

Even if the defense at other positions is outstanding, a small hole can lead to overall defensive breakdowns. On the offensive end, Reid and Gobert being on the court at the same time limits their potential, as they are reduced to being shooters.

The collaboration of the Twin Towers may seem ideal, but it is difficult to achieve in reality. As the team continues to grow and develop, the partnership and future of the Twin Towers will be the most important factor to consider.

Conclusion Despite facing setbacks in last season's playoffs, the Timberwolves' future in the new season is still full of hope. The rise of rookie Edwards and the collaboration of the Twin Towers will continue to be crucial for the team's future. Additionally, there is room for improvement in the team's reinforcements and strategies.

However, the collaboration of the Twin Towers remains the team's biggest challenge, and it will impact their future development. Only by solving this problem can the Timberwolves achieve greater success in the new season.
