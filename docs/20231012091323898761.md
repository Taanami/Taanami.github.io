 Liu Zheng scored 10 points in the last quarter to stabilize the situation. The Chinese men's basketball team faced Hong Kong and emerged victorious in the Asian Games. The basketball event of the Hangzhou Asian Games kicked off today with 16 teams participating. The Chinese team was assigned to Group B, along with China, Mongolia, and Hong Kong. The Chinese team had a slightly shaky start but quickly found their rhythm and opened up a double-digit lead. Although they faced some offensive disruptions in the second half, they managed to overcome them smoothly. Liu Zheng, in particular, scored 10 points in the final quarter to stabilize the team's morale, leading the Chinese men's basketball team to a victorious start. In the opening minutes of the game, the Chinese team struggled to find their rhythm. However, the high-low combination of A Tino and Zeng Wendong in the restricted area, as well as Lu Junxiang's three-pointers, broke the deadlock for the Chinese team. Subsequently, Liu Zheng and Lin Tingqian also scored consecutively, widening the lead to over ten points.

In this game, the Chinese team started pressuring the opposing guards on the defensive end, causing significant pressure and numerous mistakes for the Hong Kong team. In the second quarter, the Chinese team concentrated their scoring in the first half, but their shooting percentage decreased in the latter half, and the score gap did not widen.

In the second half, Hong Kong displayed more patience in handling each possession on the offensive end. Xu Yuanzheng of the Hong Kong team repeatedly scored, while the Chinese team relied on the small-group cooperation of Zeng Wendong and Abasi, as well as Li Qiwei's three-pointers and A Tino's disruptive play in the restricted area to stabilize their offensive firepower.

In the final quarter, Hong Kong replaced Huilong'er, who performed exceptionally well. He made multiple consecutive three-pointers, causing communication errors in the Chinese team's defense. The Chinese team only scored 8 points at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and A Tino was fouled repeatedly within a single sequence and was subsequently ejected from the game. Hong Kong narrowed the score difference to 15 points. Fortunately, Liu Zheng, the key player for the Chinese team, took charge in the closing stages. He scored 10 points by himself, including two three-pointers, completely crushing Hong Kong's comeback attempt. The final score was 81-62 in favor of the Chinese team, securing their first victory at the Asian Games. In this game, Liu Zheng scored the highest 18 points, along with 3 rebounds, 2 assists, and 3 steals. Lin Tingqian contributed 14 points, 7 assists, and 3 steals, while A Tino scored 13 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. Zeng Xiangjun and Abasi each scored 10 points.

For Hong Kong, Huilong'er scored the highest 16 points and grabbed 8 rebounds, while Xu Yuanzheng scored 14 points and Yip Yiu-bun scored 10 points.
