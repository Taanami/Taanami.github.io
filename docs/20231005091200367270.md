#  Xiao Tie's attempt to cooperate with Lin Binsheng and Taishin Bank has once again failed to impress the public 
  Xiao Tie's attempt to cooperate with Lin Binsheng and Taishin Bank has once again failed to impress the public.

The weapons are sharp, as if cutting through iron like mud. The wind is sharp, and Xiao Tie is trying to imitate it. We hope to have more discussions and share various opinions on watching the game.

After the press conference, the 2023 Cross-League Invitational Tournament will once again take place, and this time it will be even bigger than last year. Even the National Chengchi University, which has won three consecutive championships in the University Basketball Association (UBA), will step onto the battlefield to see if the UBA powerhouse "Political Universe" can challenge higher levels. This will undoubtedly be a major topic of discussion in the Cross-League Invitational Tournament. As the little brother, NCCU has no burden. No one will blame them for losing to professional teams. If they win, they may face pressure as the big brother. However, the tournament rules prohibit the use of foreign players but allow the registration of foreign students, which is a basic requirement for NCCU. The team's key player, Mobley, who is known as the "strongest foreign student," can participate, which is advantageous for NCCU.

But NCCU's challenge to a higher level may not be the biggest topic of this tournament. If we consider Taiwan Beer Leopards and the SBL Taiwan Beer as a joint team, the Taishin Bank Taipei New Warriors of the T1 League can be said to be the most representative team participating in the T1 League. In the previous Cross-League Invitational Tournament, the T1 League outperformed the P. LEAGUE+ and SBL, and the championship game was an all-T1 League battle between the New Taipei Fubon Braves and the Taiwan Beer Bears. However, before the New Warriors took the court, they became the biggest topic, not because of any positive news related to the game.

Please continue reading below. Taishin Bank listed "Lin Binsheng" on the roster, as previously claimed, allowing Lin Binsheng to represent the New Warriors in the Cross-League Invitational Tournament. Of course, this time there is no Hsinchu Formosa Taishin Bank Braves, which participated in the previous tournament, so the storm has somewhat subsided. However, the combination of Lin Binsheng, Formosa Taishin Bank, and the New Warriors has already become an unavoidable focus in Taiwanese basketball during this offseason.

And today, the New Warriors held a press conference to announce the team lineup, cheerleaders, mascot, and two foreign players, as well as the foreign head coach Brian Adams. However, whether it was the news on social media about the press conference or the comments on the live stream of the press conference, they were filled with criticism and ridicule, making it obvious that Taishin Bank did not step onto the stage of the Taiwan Professional Basketball League in a celebratory atmosphere.

The controversy surrounding the "Warriors" continues below (image source: Taishin Bank Warriors). Taishin Bank Warriors and Lin Binsheng held a press conference on Monday (September 11th), where Lin Binsheng read from a script to express his apologies, recent developments, and his decision-making process. But the biggest problem is that at the end of the "press conference," the host on-site announced that Lin Binsheng and the appointed lawyer would not be available for interviews, and if reporters had any questions, they should "talk to team leader Shang Ruiqiang." However, throughout the press conference, Shang Ruiqiang mainly emphasized the opposition between Taishin Bank and Formosa Taishin Bank Braves and only revealed more about "the Warriors' offer to Lin Binsheng may not be higher than the Braves, but it provides more security for his overseas career." In terms of a press conference, this is undoubtedly a very poor way of handling it. It is obvious that reporters would want to ask the person who signed the contract questions. Of course, Taishin Bank may be concerned about Lin Binsheng's ability to express himself since he is a player, but that is the job of the appointed lawyer. Since in the previous coordination meeting, Lin Binsheng could be represented by the appointed lawyer, it is the basic obligation for both of them (representing the same person) to be available for interviews at the press conference. However, in the end, Lin Binsheng left with a bewildering statement of "taking the responsibility that should be taken," and the appointed lawyer mentioned the already infamous "legal prosecutorial rights" on the internet. Then both of them refused to be interviewed, leaving only team leader Shang Ruiqiang. From his conversation with the media, it is clear that Shang Ruiqiang cannot clarify any doubts about Lin Binsheng. In other words, although many details have been revealed since the incident broke out, such as the time of the Braves' contact with Lin Binsheng, the content of the contract, and its validity, the key point lies in the person who signed with both sides. Unless he can confidently and flawlessly present his side of the story, leaving no doubts for any party, a press conference is obviously a place where reporters will want to question the person who signed the contract.

The negative reviews extended to social media as well. Taishin Bank Warriors' Instagram account was launched after the press conference, and Lin Binsheng, who had been unresponsive since the announcement of his joining the Braves, actively commented on many of Taishin Bank Warriors' posts, especially when introducing teammates. Lin Binsheng almost always commented early with a supportive attitude, showing his recognition and goodwill towards his teammates. However, due to recent inappropriate public appearances or statements, the comments on the Warriors' Instagram were filled with criticisms not only towards Lin Binsheng but also towards the team. Even when Lin Binsheng stopped commenting, the mocking remarks from netizens continued to flood the Warriors' Instagram.
