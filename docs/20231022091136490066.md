  T1League Executive Board Denies Taichung Sun's Participation in New Season

Despite their impressive performance in last season's playoffs, defeating the top-ranked team and winning a thrilling Game 2 against Taiwan Beer, followed by a dramatic victory over Yulon Luxgen Dinos in a nail-biting match, with foreign player Rayvonte Rice scoring the game-winning shot, Taichung Sun will have to leave these memorable moments behind for the time being. According to the official announcement from T1League on September 15, after several reviews by the league's executive board, Taichung Sun failed to meet the financial qualifications set by the league and therefore, will not be allowed to participate in the new season.

Please continue reading the full announcement from T1League below:

Taiwan Sports Lottery and T1 League aim to develop professional basketball and organize regional, national, and international basketball tournaments to improve the level of basketball in Taiwan.

The purpose of establishing related regulations is to establish a sound system for tournaments and protect the rights and interests of participating teams and players. Taichung Sun applied for the league's participation in the 2023-24 season, but after multiple reviews by the league's executive board, they failed to meet the financial qualifications set by the league.

Therefore, in the 22nd executive board meeting, it was decided not to approve their participation in the 2023-24 season. This announcement is hereby made. Earlier this year, Taichung Sun protested against the league, accusing them of unilaterally changing the agreement. At that time, there were rumors about a disagreement between the executive board and Taichung Sun's participation in the new season. However, today's announcement clearly shows that the executive board rejected Taichung Sun's participation due to the team's past financial disputes. The executive board had set deadlines for Taichung Sun to provide a trust fund and guarantee money twice, but they failed to meet the requirements. As a result, the executive board voted and decided that Taichung Sun did not qualify to participate in the league. Since its establishment, Taichung Sun has been surrounded by controversies. First, their official social media accounts were suspected of using paid trolls. Some active accounts were registered in the Middle East. Later, the team made a self-mocking post about their first player being "Arab," but it was not well-received by fans, leading to criticism. The team's name was also changed multiple times, and their home court at Taichung Stadium was questioned for its poor facilities. Other controversies included practicing without air conditioning, accusations of unpaid salaries, the process of obtaining a special foreign player status for White Sa, the sudden termination of foreign player Tony Bishop due to financial disputes, withdrawing from a game due to a player's positive COVID-19 test, and suddenly replacing all foreign players at the end of last season. All of these incidents have raised doubts and criticism from the public. And now, with the executive board's rejection, Taichung Sun's participation in T1League has come to an end, leaving many questions for the public. Please continue reading below. Currently, Taichung Sun still has nine players under contract, including national team player Su Yi-Jin, three-point shooting champion Lu Guan-Xuan, and White Sa with a special foreign player status. Their future plans will be closely watched. If they successfully transfer to another team, they could become valuable players for their new team. However, the biggest concern is Taichung Sun's financial situation, which has been under scrutiny in recent years. The team has been involved in the most salary and contract disputes within the professional league, raising concerns about their financial stability. While it is expected that there will be rich and poor teams in a professional league, constant salary disputes have raised doubts about Taichung Sun's management. Regardless, at this critical moment when the new season is about to start, T1League's rejection of Taichung Sun's participation means that the upcoming season will only have five teams â€“ New Taipei CTBC Brothers, Tainan Taiwan Steel Falcons, Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology, Taoyuan Pauian Archiland, and Taipei Fubon Braves. It is also worth noting if there will be any changes in the tournament format (including playoffs, originally six out of six), matchups, and other details.
