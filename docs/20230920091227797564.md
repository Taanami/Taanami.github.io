 14 Lai Zhengwei, with his impressive performance approaching double-double stats in every game, was awarded the Best Five in the central region. In the national tournament, he delivered an astonishing performance of 20 points and 10 rebounds against the talented Fu Ming International team. He averaged 10.2 rebounds per game, becoming the rebounding king of this year's senior college group. Please continue reading.

Captain Lin Junjie, who previously attended Changhua Teacher's Secondary School, believes that the difference between high school and college is that the desire to win is not as high as in high school. The key is being able to play basketball together with everyone. He specifically said, "To the future juniors of CHH in the inter-school competition, I think the essence of the World Fire Protection Cup is to allow everyone to gather and play basketball before graduation. I hope that we won't let the competition affect our harmony, and I also hope that CHH can continue the tradition of being all Changhua people. I would also like to express my special thanks to every member of the team who cooperated with me to form CHH again. They followed my instructions and arrangements in the game. Thank you all for taking this competition seriously. I look forward to the senior college group continuing next year so that we can reunite every summer."

Another player, Lin Youhua, who was once the "War God" of Chung Shih High School, led his team to the South District playoffs. He is younger in the CHH lineup this time, but he still performs like a warrior on the court. He provides outside firepower at critical moments and is one of the players that opponents need to defend against. As a junior, he mentioned that due to the suspension of the tournament in his senior year of high school because of the pandemic, this is his first time participating in CHH. Just coincidentally, the senior college group was introduced this time, and he had the opportunity to wear the CHH jersey that he had always dreamed of. He said with a smile, "I am very happy to compete with seniors from different years. I used to be amazed by their skills, only able to watch them dominate in various competitions. It feels wonderful to be on the same team with them now."

In addition, playing in high school is more like a gathering of classmates, but this time, being able to represent Changhua together with the seniors to compete for glory gives a special feeling. Especially for those seniors who were amazing and could only be silently admired in the past, being able to stand on the court and fight together with them today brings great joy. Finally, it is an honor to accompany the fourth-year seniors on their last stage before graduation. Please continue reading.

Both of them expressed that being able to reunite everyone through the World Fire Protection Cup and allowing CHH to continue not only in high school but also in college is thanks to the tournament benefitting amateur players like them. It also provides a stage for players from the regular group to continue to excel. They also express their gratitude to every staff member for providing us with such a wonderful stage and environment.

Every reunion has its meaning. Whether it is from the words or the performances of the players on and off the court, we can see their sense of belonging and identification with the name and team of CHH. Being able to use the World Fire Protection Cup to connect players from different years and maintain this tradition is the long-term goal and philosophy of the tournament.

Although the juniors in the inter-school competition this year did not have the opportunity to stand on the national tournament stage with the seniors, we believe that after the seniors have showcased CHH, whether it is the players in the senior college group or those who compete in the inter-school group, they will be able to continue this tradition and promote the glory of CHH, which belongs to Changhua people.
