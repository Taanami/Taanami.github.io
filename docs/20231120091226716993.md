On the second day of the PLG23-24 preseason, the first game featured the Taoyuan Puyuan PLG facing off against the Hsinchu Attack Lions, who had also played yesterday. The Lions dominated the first half, but were caught up by the PLG in the third quarter. In the end, the PLG successfully turned the tables and secured their first preseason victory. In the first quarter, the Lions continued their strong momentum from yesterday, with 10 players scoring in the first half. The team did not rely on their foreign players to score, playing a smooth and sharing offensive game. They also had a 50% three-point shooting percentage, hitting 9 three-pointers and leading the PLG 57-40 at halftime. The PLG had more shot attempts in the first half, but their shooting percentage was not ideal. Only Zhang Zhenya's 9 points, including 3 three-pointers, stood out.

In this game, the Lions did not follow the same strategy as the previous one, choosing to continue playing their foreign players in the second half to build chemistry. However, the PLG's foreign player, Max, scored continuously in the paint, helping the team narrow the gap. The Lions focused on outside shots in this quarter, but they couldn't find their rhythm and also got into foul trouble. Their 17-point lead disappeared and the game was tied going into the fourth quarter. In the decisive fourth quarter, both Kela and Brown committed unsportsmanlike fouls, giving the PLG an advantage in the beginning. The PLG's Lawrence stepped up and scored multiple times inside, disrupting the Lions' defense.

In the final moments, when the team was struggling, Gao Guohao hit two consecutive three-pointers to keep the Lions in the game. However, the PLG did not waste their efforts in catching up, with Max drawing fouls and making free throws, and Bai Yicheng hitting a three-pointer from the corner. In the end, the PLG defeated the Attack Lions 91-82. Max finished with a team-high 17 points and 12 rebounds, while Lawrence had 13 points and 6 rebounds. For the Lions, Gao Guohao had a team-high 16 points, and Zhu Yunhao and Kela each had 13 points.
