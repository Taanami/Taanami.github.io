In the crucial "Straits Showdown" of the men's basketball tournament, which determines the leader of the group, tens of thousands of fans flocked to the Hangzhou Asian Games new venue, the Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium, yesterday evening. Although the Chinese team briefly took the lead in the first quarter, they fell behind as their outside shooting faltered, and ultimately suffered their first defeat in the group stage with a score of 69-89. They will face Mongolia tomorrow evening and strive for second place in the group. Yesterday, China's three-point shooting was 15 out of 35, with Zhao Jiwei and Du Runwang combining for 11 successful shots out of 16 attempts, dealing heavy damage to the Chinese team. Chinese team head coach Sang Maosen said, "Throughout the game, we emphasized the inside game and protecting the paint, but we missed many defensive rebounds, and the opponent took advantage of it."

Facing the seven players over two meters tall from the host country, China trailed in rebounds with a score of 47-50. "New Taiwanese" Atingo also contributed 21 points and 11 rebounds, but the team only scored 25 points in the first half, with their offense only picking up in the second half. Lin Tingqian, the key player of the Chinese team, believes that apart from the physical intensity given by the opponents, it was also the team's first time playing in such a big venue, causing tension in the first half. Both offensive and defensive details are worth reviewing and learning from.

Due to injuries in the backcourt this year, Lin Tingqian took on the role of organizing the team under pressure. He self-evaluated his performance yesterday with seven assists as "unsatisfactory", saying, "I didn't do too well in these two games. I need to review and improve, and learn from these two games."
