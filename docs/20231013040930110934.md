Yesterday, Bucks guard Jrue Holiday was interviewed about his contract, which only has one year left. When asked if he was willing to re-sign with the team, Holiday said, "I think I've said before that I will always be a part of the Bucks. I don't want to play for any other team. I believe that we have the opportunity to continue to do great things as the Bucks and as an organization, so I want to stay in Milwaukee."

"I've had the best three seasons of my career with the Bucks, not only that, but we have a winning record and have become a top team or one of the top three teams. Before I came to the Bucks, I didn't think I would be on a team that consistently ranks in the top three in the league," added Holiday. 

However, in a blockbuster three-team trade completed this morning, Damian Lillard was sent to the Bucks and, as part of the deal, Jrue Holiday was traded from the Bucks to the Trail Blazers. According to subsequent reports from ESPN, sources revealed that the Trail Blazers will focus on trading Holiday to one of the top teams in the league, with potential destinations including the Celtics and the Heat.
