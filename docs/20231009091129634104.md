  202324 Key Player: Keegan Murray of the Sacramento Kings

Recap of the Rookie Season 2022-23: In his rookie season, Keegan Murray broke Donovan Mitchell's record for most three-pointers made in a rookie season (187) with 206 three-pointers made. What's even more impressive is that he achieved this with a shooting percentage of 41.1%, showcasing his quality as a sharpshooter. Keegan benefited from the Kings' fast-paced and space-oriented tactics, as well as the support of Domantas Sabonis and De'Aaron Fox, who had a career-best season, tearing through opposing defenses. This allowed Keegan to enjoy good shot quality.

According to BBall-Index, among the 22 players who played over 1,000 minutes and ranked in the top 10% for three-point shooting percentage and made threes, only Joe Harris, Jevon Carter, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Malcolm Brogdon had better three-point shot quality than Keegan. Besides his excellent shooting touch, Keegan also owes his high shooting percentage to the favorable shooting environment provided by the team.

Although the Kings made their first playoff appearance in 16 years, they faced the defending champions, the Golden State Warriors, in a highly intense and defensive series. Initially, Keegan had limited contributions, averaging only 3.3 points and 4 rebounds per game in the first three games. However, he proved his worth in the following games, helping the team extend the series to a seventh game.

During the regular season, Keegan averaged only 4.6 rebounds per game. But in the next four games, he showcased his rebounding ability, averaging 8 rebounds per game, and improved his scoring, averaging 14.5 points per game. Although the Kings ultimately fell short in the series, Keegan's presence in the later playoff games created high expectations for his performance in the upcoming season.

Visible Transformation: Every summer is a turning point for NBA players' growth. Last summer, during his honeymoon, Fox, who had just gotten married, continued to train hard, leading to his breakout season in 22-23. After his rookie season ended, Keegan, who was about to enter his first offseason, didn't take it easy. He joined Fox in voluntary training sessions and even took on the role of a mentor. This raises expectations for Keegan's growth in the offseason under Fox's guidance, similar to what Fox experienced in the previous season.

In an interview, Keegan mentioned that he and Fox had engaged in one-on-one matchups multiple times during their training sessions. For Keegan, who rarely displayed his ability to create his own offense during his rookie season, this was a great opportunity to hone his skills. Although Keegan humbly admitted that he hadn't won a single game against Fox in their training sessions, fans witnessed what they wanted to see during the California Classic game hosted by the Kings.

Despite his highly efficient performance in perimeter shooting and catch-and-shoot threes last season, all of his 97.6% three-pointers made were assisted. This raised doubts about his ability to create his own offense at the NBA level. While elite spot-up shooters have a place in the modern NBA that emphasizes spacing, developing the ability to create his own offense and generate space will take Keegan's offensive game to the next level. Keegan indeed responded to these expectations during the California Classic. In the first game against the Golden State Warriors, he scored a game-high 29 points. Early in the game, he showcased his ball-handling and coast-to-coast dunking ability, exciting the Kings' fans and surprising his teammates Malik Monk and Davion Mitchell, who knew that he hadn't shown this kind of play throughout the previous year.
