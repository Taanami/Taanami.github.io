 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver recently appeared on ESPN's "First Take" to discuss the possibility of changing the format of the 2024 All-Star Game to East vs. West, as well as the issue of players resting during the regular season. He also shared his thoughts on the public trade requests made by Damian Lillard and James Harden this summer. According to Silver, trade requests have been a common occurrence in the league for many years, but the league's focus now is to handle these situations behind closed doors, as opposed to in the public eye, as was the case with Lillard and Harden this year. Silver stated, "I've never treated this (player trade requests) as a secret, it's not something new in the league and can be traced back to a long time ago."

However, there are some players who want to get out of their contracts, and I believe there are also some teams who wish they hadn't signed certain contracts with players." He continued, "Of course, the league's expectation is that everyone takes pride in their contracts. And if a player or team is unhappy, these issues should be resolved behind closed doors." Silver then turned to the hosts and said, "But I don't want to be naive, whenever we sit down to discuss this, there will always be situations where someone will ask me, 'What's going on over there?' 'Why doesn't that player want to fulfill their contract?' or 'Why is that team unhappy?' So we (the league) have to handle these situations."
