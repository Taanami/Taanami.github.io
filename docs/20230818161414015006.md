  38-year-old Lakers star LeBron James becomes the first player in NBA history to average 28.9 points in his 20th season.

The NBA playoffs will begin today (12th), marking the completion of LeBron James' 20th regular season. According to statistics, James averaged 28.9 points this season, the highest among players who have completed 20 seasons in the league.

Despite only playing in 55 games this season due to injuries, James still leads the team with an average of 28.9 points. If it weren't for his limited playing time, the 38-year-old James could have ranked 7th in the league's scoring list. On January 31st, James recorded 28 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds, leading the team to victory with an excellent triple-double performance.

In NBA history, there are a total of 11 players who have completed at least 20 seasons, including James and the recently retired Heat spiritual leader, 42-year-old Haslem (Udonis Haslem). However, only James can perform like a young player. According to data from the American statistical media StatMuse, James, in his 20th season, averaged 28.9 points, followed by the late Lakers star Bryant, who averaged 17.6 points in his 20th season in 2015-16. The third place is Dirk Nowitzki in the 2017-18 season, averaging 12 points. James graduated from high school in 2003 and joined the Cleveland Cavaliers as the first overall pick that year.

Since 2006, the NBA has banned high school students from joining the league directly after graduation. For James, playing one year ahead gave him an advantage.

According to ESPN, James mentioned in an interview that he owes his ability to play 20 seasons and maintain a high level of performance to his personal trainer, Mike Mancias.

James said, "Without him, it would be impossible for me to perform at this level. He plays a crucial role in my game and my performance. I could play 7 to 12 seasons on my own, but 20 seasons without him would be impossible."

Mancias was hired as the assistant strength and conditioning trainer for the Cavaliers in the 2002 season and developed a good working relationship with James, who joined the team the following year. In 2004, James hired him as his personal trainer, a role he has held until now.
