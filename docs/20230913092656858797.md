Marc Gasol, currently playing for the Spanish basketball club Bàsquet Girona, recently gave an interview to "Catalunya Ràdio". In the interview, Marc Gasol expressed that he is not ready to retire yet and still has a great passion for the sport of basketball. "I had previously thought about retiring, but it is harder than I expected," said Marc Gasol. "When the season ended in June, I thought my intention to continue as a player had passed. Now I am reconsidering this matter. I really love basketball, so saying goodbye is not that simple," Marc Gasol said.

Marc Gasol is currently 38 years old, and his last appearance in the NBA can be traced back to the 2020-2021 season when he played for the Los Angeles Lakers. Later, he returned to Spain and joined Bàsquet Girona, where he has been playing ever since.
