The Danger Factor of Lithuania Basketball, the Dark Horse of the 2023 World Cup from Eastern Europe

Lithuania is undoubtedly one of the dark horse teams in this year's World Cup.

Just a few months ago, ranked 15th by FIBA, they defeated several strong teams and even beat the US team. Even in their own country, it was not expected that they would have such a performance this year before the final roster was announced.

Now, let's get to know Lithuania, the Eastern European team that has performed remarkably in this year's World Cup.

Please continue reading "Who is Next?" This is the reaction of Lithuania's number one star, Jonas Valanciunas, to the resignation of former assistant coach Kestutis Kemzura on the BasketNews Instagram account a few weeks before the start of training camp. Valanciunas has not missed a single major FIBA tournament in the past 16 years. Therefore, when another teammate chose not to attend the national team training camp, he expressed his frustration. Lithuania could have formed a team with all the top players, but players like Domantas Sabonis, Marius Grigonis, Rokas Giedraitis, Edgaras Ulanovas, Arnas Butkevicius, Lukas Lekavicius and Arturas Gudaitis all refused to represent Lithuania for various reasons in the World Cup.

However, the remaining players have become a perfect example that big-name players do not always guarantee the best results, and vice versa. Despite the disappointment of Sabonis, one of Lithuania's top players, choosing not to participate in the World Cup, it also relieved head coach Kazys Maksvytis to some extent.

He no longer has to worry about how to make Valanciunas and Sabonis cooperate on the court, as no coach has been able to successfully make these two NBA players fit together, which has been proven many times in previous international competitions. Valanciunas became the main low-post threat in the team, ensuring scoring in the paint. In the World Cup, he performed as expected, scoring 14.5 points (shooting 69.2% from two-point range), 11 rebounds, and 1.5 assists, with a very impressive efficiency. He also made it to the All-Tournament Second Team after the Cup ended.

Please continue reading before the World Cup, the 22-year-old Jokubaitis did not fully live up to the expectations and potential that had been placed on him in the past few years.

He also encountered difficulties in the first game against Egypt in the World Cup, scoring only 2 points and going 0 for 6 from the field, and committing three turnovers.

However, he bounced back like an experienced star in the following games. In the three games against Mexico, Montenegro, and Greece, Jokubaitis averaged 17.7 points, 2.7 rebounds and 6.3 assists, with an efficiency score of 23.3. In addition, his three-point shooting was also impressive, making 8 out of 7 shots.

Despite being only 22 years old, he is also one of the youngest starting point guards in this tournament, but his teammates appreciate his ability to control the game and direct the offense. "When I think back to my performance and decision-making at his age, I can only give him a lot of praise because he can effectively handle the high-level challenges he faces. He knows clearly that if he doesn't perform well, we may face a difficult game. He struggled in the first game, just like last year. But he quickly learned from his mistakes and made progress." Mindaugas Kuzminskas said. With Marius Grigonis withdrawing, Ignas Brazdeikis became the only true scorer who can solve problems in critical moments, especially when Lithuania needs a last-minute one-on-one solution.

Teammates noticed that Brazdeikis doesn't like to force his way to the basket, but rather reads the situation and is willing to share the ball, unlike last year.

The current Brazdeikis is averaging 11.5 points, shooting an impressive 54.5% from two-point range and 70% from three-point range. He also contributes with an average of 4.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game.

His turnovers have decreased from 2.2 in the last European Basketball Championship to 1.0 in the World Cup, and his shooting percentage has increased by a surprising 20.7%.

The other players around this core team have also shown their professional strengths, whether as defensive specialists or versatile veterans, and their team's success always takes precedence over personal ambitions.

For example, former New York Knick Mindaugas Kuzminskas was barely in the rotation in the 2019 World Cup and 2021 Olympic qualifying matches.

However, under the guidance of Kazys Maksvytis, he successfully regained his confidence and returned to his normal performance.

As a 33-year-old veteran, Kuzminskas performed well in the World Cup, averaging 10.8 points, 5.0 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game, shooting 75% from two-point range and 46.2% from three-point range. He can also make key shots in crucial moments of the game.

This is the danger factor of Lithuania. They do not rely on any one player, but rather on the overall performance of the team. Their players can complement each other, trust each other, and are willing to sacrifice personal interests to play for the national team. Their team spirit and selfless dedication make them a formidable dark horse team.
