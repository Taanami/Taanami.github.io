  Germany defeats Serbia in the second half of the World Cup, securing their first World Cup championship.

After 91 games, the final championship game of the FIBA World Cup arrived, featuring two of the best-performing European teams of this tournament: Germany and Serbia. The first half ended in a tie, with both teams finding ways to counterattack their opponents' offense. Towards the end of the third quarter, Serbia encountered turbulence, allowing Germany to take a 12-point lead. In the fourth quarter, Serbia made a valiant effort to come back, but ultimately fell short. With a score of 83-77, Germany claimed their first-ever World Cup championship.

Both teams displayed their best offensive strategies throughout the game, focusing on half-court battles. Serbia relied more on empty-handed drives, while Germany utilized more team coordination. In the first quarter, the lead changed six times and the score was tied four times, with Serbia narrowly ahead by 3 points (26-23).

Unfortunately for Serbia, their starting player Ognjen Dobric had to leave the game early due to an ankle injury.

In the second quarter, both teams continued to fight fiercely. Germany relied on the individual scoring abilities of NBA players Franz Wagner and Dennis Schroder, while Serbia's Bogdan Bogdanovic continued his outstanding performance from previous games, scoring 15 points in the first half. The score was tied at 47 points as they entered the second half. The defensive intensity increased in the second half, and Serbia committed too many offensive mistakes. Within the first six minutes of the third quarter, Serbia only scored 6 points, allowing Germany to establish an 11-point lead. The Wagner brothers played a crucial role in extending the lead to 12 points, with Franz Wagner hitting a three-pointer and Moritz Wagner scoring under the basket. In the final quarter, Serbia launched a comeback effort, with Aleksa Avramovic and Filip Petrusev scoring consecutively. Germany called a timeout. Avramovic continued to perform well after the timeout, scoring another five points. However, Johannes Voigtmann's three-pointer from the corner stopped Serbia's momentum. In the last two minutes, after Serbia called a timeout, Avramovic once again contributed to his team with a three-pointer and a drawn foul beyond the arc, narrowing the gap to 3 points from a 9-point difference before the timeout. In a crucial moment, Germany called a timeout but made an offensive mistake afterward. Marko Guduric's three-pointer missed, preventing Serbia from tying the game directly.

After Germany's counterattack, Serbia committed a foul. Schroder made one of the two free throws. In the next possession, Guduric's offensive attempt did not result in a foul, but he made both free throws. With 21.4 seconds left, Schroder created space and successfully scored in a one-on-one situation, extending Germany's lead to four points. In the next play, Guduric made a fatal mistake, leading to the loss of the game. Germany claimed their first-ever national championship.
