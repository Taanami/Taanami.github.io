 NBA World All-Stars vs. USA Olympic Team Possible Starting Lineup: Shaq, I can't make a choice on who will win.

USA team vs. World team. After the completion of the World Cup on Sunday, players who have the opportunity to play for the USA team in the upcoming Paris Olympics have come out to express their willingness to serve their country. The issue of team strength has also become a topic of discussion. People are starting to debate whether, if the USA team were to assemble the strongest lineup, they could compete against the best five players from other countries. "The Big Aristotle" Shaquille O'Neal posted a question on social media today, asking fans for their opinions on who would win between the USA team and the World team shown in the photo. 

World team lineup: Luka Dončić, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokić, Joel Embiid
USA team lineup: Stephen Curry, Jayson Tatum, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, Anthony Davis

The comments section has sparked a lot of discussion. Some believe that the USA team, who couldn't win in just a few days, should stop boasting about being the "world champions" and first prove that they can beat Germany before talking about assembling these All-Star teams. Others think that having LeBron and Curry on the same team would be unfair to other countries in the world. 

Of course, this World team lineup is unlikely to happen in a real international game. These discussions are more about comparing the best lineups from countries other than the United States and whether they are slowly catching up to the USA team. It would be interesting to see the USA Basketball Association send out stronger lineups to compete with other countries in the future.
