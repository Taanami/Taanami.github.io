Jayson Tatum, the forward for the Boston Celtics, recently participated in a social media video with Complex Sports where he played a game of "true or false." One of the questions asked if Milwaukee Bucks fans are annoying. This was in reference to an interview with Khris Middleton where he mentioned that Celtics fans can be fierce. When asked about this, Tatum responded, "That's false. They have great fans and atmosphere." When asked if he has a least favorite fan base, Tatum immediately answered, "Philadelphia." He went on to explain, "Philadelphia had the first pick in the draft and could have chosen me, so there is a love-hate relationship between us." Tatum was selected third overall by the Celtics in 2017, while the Philadelphia 76ers had the first pick and traded it to the Celtics for the first overall pick, which they used to select Markelle Fultz. It can be assumed that Tatum and the 76ers were in contention for that top pick during the draft process.
