 The three-month-long Lillard trade saga has finally come to an end, with the Bucks acquiring Damian Lillard as their new player. The Suns also got involved in the trade, sending Deandre Ayton in exchange for Jusuf Nurkic, Nassir Little, Keon Johnson, and Grayson Allen.

The main selling point for the Blazers, who were the primary sellers in this trade, is that they are unlikely to keep Jrue Holiday and will seek another buyer. However, for the other two teams, it may not necessarily be a significant improvement. While Holiday may have a gap in offensive skills compared to Lillard, he is a rare point guard in the league with top-notch defensive abilities. Ayton's presence on the court may be lower, but considering his draft position and salary, he is not necessarily worse than the players they received in return.

This three-team trade is actually a win-win-win situation, not necessarily based on the players' skills, but because it meets the current needs of all three teams. The Bucks acquire a player for the postseason and a stable four-year period.

Before discussing the Bucks' situation, it is important to emphasize a trend under the new collective bargaining agreement. The number of star players entering free agency and changing teams through the free agent market will decrease. Since 2019, there have been only two non-minimum-salary players, Gordon Hayward in 2020 and DeMar DeRozan in 2021, who have switched teams as free agents. Other star players have either re-signed with their current teams, signed extensions before becoming free agents, or traded and then re-signed before their contracts expired.

The main reason for this phenomenon is that there are fewer teams with significant salary cap space, and even if there are, they are usually not competitive teams. With the new collective bargaining agreement and the introduction of the luxury tax line, teams will find it even more challenging to create enough salary cap space. Therefore, players who have friction with their current teams or uncertainty about their next contract will often request trades to teams that need them more, allowing them to continue earning high salaries without salary cap restrictions. What if a star player cannot stay with a team that really needs them and cannot be traded before their contract expires? The only option is to take a pay cut.

Holiday has his issues, especially in the playoffs, where he has struggled throughout his career, except for one postseason with the Pelicans in 2017-18. In his three years with the Bucks, he has averaged 17.9 points in the playoffs with a 3P% of only 0.304 and an eFG% of only 0.453. In addition, he takes about 3.5 more shots per game in the playoffs compared to the regular season. Considering his salary and performance in the regular season, it can be said that he has severely underperformed. Both Holiday and Lillard are 33 years old, with their birthdays only a month apart. In terms of health, Lillard may appear worse due to his early ironman career, but apart from the 2021-22 season when Lillard had a more severe injury, they are relatively similar.

Lillard's playoff performance is slightly inferior to his regular-season performance but not to the extent of Holiday. He also has multiple records of heroic game-saving shots, which adds a valuable weapon for the Bucks in the playoffs. However, besides the difference in playoff performance between the two players, another key factor is the contract issue.

Giannis Antetokounmpo will turn 29 in the upcoming season, and he has two more years on his guaranteed contract, with a player option in 2025-26. Given Giannis' importance and significance to the Bucks, it is almost certain that he will sign a max extension in advance. The Bucks will only consider a changing of the guard after his next contract. However, his main supporting cast, Brook Lopez (35 years old), Holiday (33 years old), and Kris Middleton (32 years old), are best suited to accompany Giannis for the next 2-3 years, until his contract ends. They will inevitably face a wave of changes in their supporting cast. Lillard's contract runs until 2027, which allows the Bucks to stagger the process of finding replacements for their supporting cast. They won't have to find replacements for all three positions within a year or two or endure a one-time decline. Of course, Lillard will also decline, but the Bucks can seek opportunities to strengthen the team from other positions.
