  PLG Li Ruiqi Returns to Join Ironman, Encounters Car Accident But Not Discouraged, Ready to Start Again From Kaohsiung

Kaohsiung 17 Live Ironman strengthened their team before the pre-season warm-up game. Today (19), the team officially announced the signing of Li Ruiqi. During his graduate studies at Shoufu University, Li Ruiqi's outstanding jumping ability and offensive skills earned him the "Scoring King" and "Rebounding King" titles in the UBA Men's Division 1 league. He played for the Fubon Braves from 2017 to 2019, joined the Kaohsiung Jutai Technology team from 2019 to 2021, and joined the P. LEAGUE+ New Taipei Kings from 2021 to 2023.

In the 2021-22 season, he averaged 4 points and 2.2 rebounds as a substitute. In the middle of the 2022-23 season, he suffered a left knee injury due to a car accident and was cancelled for the rest of the season. He returned to the court for training in early July and received treatment from Fu Jen Catholic University Sports Medicine Center during his rehabilitation. Li Ruiqi has now joined the Ironman training and is undergoing rehabilitation treatment with the Ironman medical team, gradually increasing the intensity of his training.

Having not trained on the court for almost a year, Li Ruiqi's short-term goal is to play in the warm-up game and reunite with fans as soon as possible. Li Ruiqi is originally from Tainan and attended Xingrong High School and Shoufu University. Most of his educational career was in southern Taiwan. Now, after moving to the north and joining the Ironman in Kaohsiung, he was reminded of the warmth of his hometown when he encountered a low point in his career and life due to the car accident last season.

Speaking of his decision to return to the south, Li Ruiqi said, "My wife and child are still in Taipei, and I am worried and reluctant to leave them. But with the full support of my family, I can play in Kaohsiung without any worries and hope to create my own value here." Head coach Qiu Dazong said, "Ruiqi is a 3D player with high basketball IQ. He has a clear mind on the court and plays with great intensity. He also often encourages and reminds his teammates off the court. As a local player for the Ironman, he brings a very positive development in both playing style and culture."

Head coach Qiu Dazong also recognized Li Ruiqi's strong desire to return to the court and hopes he can recover quickly and contribute to the Ironman's success.
