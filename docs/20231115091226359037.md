 The CBL championship game took place at the home court of National Taiwan Normal University, where they invited alumnus Huang Wanlong and singer Guo Jing to show their support.

After a month of CBL college basketball games, the final championship game of this week officially began with National Taiwan Normal University hosting National Chengchi University. This is the second time the two teams have met after the group stage in this tournament. The atmosphere was heated with the continuous increase of prizes and performances. The enthusiastic support of the campus students and alumni made the home court of National Taiwan Normal University lively.

During halftime, singer Guo Jing performed several of her hit songs, including "The Next Morning," which hyped up the crowd. As the founder and organizer of the tournament, National Taiwan Normal University is committed to setting an example for home court management. Not only did they provide free T-shirts and souvenirs for every game, but they also invited famous singers such as Lo Junshuo, Yan Youting from "The Ultimate Athlete," alumnus and Chinese national player Lin Xinkuan, and Chen Yujie to attend the games. For the championship game tonight, "honorary alumnus" Huang Wanlong, who is the coach of HBL Songshan High School, will be the guest of honor for the opening ceremony. The new singer from "The Voice of China" Guo Jiawei, and "queen of love songs" Guo Jing will also perform during the opening and halftime show. With the alumni and celebrities standing together, it showed the strong unity and spirit of National Taiwan Normal University. National Taiwan Normal University player and Chinese national female basketball player Chen Yujie was invited to be the guest of honor for the opening ceremony of the championship game. Huang Wanlong, who is also the coach of Songshan High School and the advisor for Taipei Taishin Warriors, shared his emotional memories, "It has been over 20 years since I last came back to my alma mater. I graduated from the Department of Physical Education in 1982 and have sweated and competed on this court. I even participated in sports and dance performances here. I want to thank the president of National Taiwan Normal University and the officials for recognizing and supporting basketball, which led to the establishment of Songshan High School. The home and away games are very different, it's not just a competition between teams, but also a challenge for the whole school to come together. I hope all the younger students can enjoy the game and create more wonderful memories in college!" Alumnus Huang Wanlong opened the game and cheered for National Taiwan Normal University with the students. This is the third time the two teams have met in this tournament. Despite missing key players such as Yu Zhe and Mobaye, National Chengchi University still managed to perform well on both offense and defense, with Li Yunjie scoring 13 points in one quarter and making the game-winning shot.

National Taiwan Normal University tried to keep up the pace on offense with Wei Penghe leading the team, but they struggled to defend against their opponents, which became a fatal flaw throughout the game. In the end, National Chengchi University remained undefeated and held their ground against the pressure of playing away from home.

The final score was 62:88, with National Chengchi University remaining undefeated. The CBL championship game adopts a "two-game system," and after this game, they will switch home courts and have the final showdown at National Chengchi University on Friday (11/10). This is the last warm-up game before the new season of UBA, and everyone is invited to come and join the excitement.
