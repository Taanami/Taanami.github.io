Can the FIBA World Cup annual first team withstand FIBA's rule test? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 7-game World Cup observation

As expected, SGA will represent Canada in the FIBA Basketball World Cup during the off-season. The FIBA format, which has limited space for offense, has made it difficult for many NBA stars to adapt. SGA's main scoring areas are in the mid-range and inside the paint. However, Canada is not like many European teams where players have played together for several years. Their roster is very unstable (the most experienced player, Kelly Olynyk, played in the 2010 World Cup) and their head coach, Jordi Fernandez (an assistant coach for the Kings), is coaching a national team for the first time.

Therefore, as a first-timer in the adult national team, SGA is not expected to achieve great results. In the group stage, except for the game against Lebanon where the skill gap was too big, SGA's performance was almost the same in games against France and Latvia. The tight defense from Batum and Latvia's height advantage made it difficult for him to perform well in the beginning of the game. However, SGA showed great adaptability. If the opponents did not use targeted defensive strategies (such as double-teaming or trapping), he could still score efficiently in the second half.

In the second round, SGA faced more frequent double-teams. Brazil's tight defense and tall frontcourt, combined with teammates like RJ Barrett and Nickeil Alexander-Walker having poor shooting performances, made it difficult for SGA to find open shots. This resulted in his lowest shooting percentage in the tournament (less than 50%). In the game after the group stage, facing the pressure of "win or go home," SGA had a rare poor performance in the third quarter. However, as the team's leader, he still managed to step up in crucial moments. With less than two minutes left in the game, he made a difficult three-pointer and a mid-range jump shot near the three-point line (he also made all six free throws in the final moments), along with Brooks' amazing performance, helped Canada secure a spot in the quarter-finals and a ticket to the Paris Olympics.

In the quarter-finals against Slovenia, it was supposed to be an exciting matchup between the two top stars in the tournament (SGA vs Doncic). However, the game was overshadowed by biased officiating. But in terms of SGA's performance, even if those free throws were not called, his performance was still unquestionably excellent. When Slovenia closed the gap to single digits in the fourth quarter, SGA stepped up with consecutive buckets and an offensive rebound to secure the win. This was the last challenge and weakness he faced in the tournament. Despite the lack of defensive three-second violations, which reduced his frequency of entering the paint, SGA was still able to use early offense and mid-range shots to tear apart the defense. His biggest weakness may be his three-point shooting percentage, which was less than 30% in the tournament.

In the semi-finals against Serbia, they fully exploited this weakness. Serbia's strategy was simple - completely deny SGA any shooting space. From the paint to the three-point line, they constantly put pressure on him. The primary defender, Aleksa Avramovic, was a tough matchup for SGA. Even if SGA managed to get past him, there would always be help defense waiting. In addition, they had Nikola Milutinov protecting the paint, which forced SGA to pass the ball throughout the game (only 8 field goal attempts for 15 points).

Serbia's rotation and help defense were also very impressive. Even with all the focus on SGA, they did not give other players comfortable shooting opportunities. SGA became frustrated in this extremely passive situation and even lost the ball in the logo area when Avramovic stole it from him. As a result, Canada lost the game.

In the bronze medal game against the USA, SGA was once again guarded by Mikal Bridges and Austin Reaves. However, their double-teaming was not as effective as Serbia's. Also, SGA, who has ball handling skills, has improved in his passing decisions after playing as the team's point guard for the entire World Cup. He not only scored 31 points with a high shooting percentage, but also had a career-high of 12 assists (partly due to Dillon Brooks' amazing performance). In overtime, he scored 5 consecutive points to stabilize the team, which ultimately led to Canada's first World Cup medal in history.

In summary, SGA's World Cup journey was definitely a success. Despite losing Jamal Murray, the team's star point guard, to injury, SGA, as the team's primary ball handler, led a group of unfamiliar teammates (except for his cousin, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and Lu Dort) and proved that he is still a top scorer, averaging over 30 points per game. He was selected to the World Cup All-Star Five and unlocked the NBA+FIBA first team in the same year. However, his lack of a reliable outside shot is still an issue. Serbia's tight defense and double-teaming clearly targeted this weakness. If SGA can improve his pull-up jump shot after using a screen or his own dribble, he can punish this type of defense. We believe that he is aware of this and will work on it. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's stats in the World Cup: 24.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 6.5 assists (only 1.4 turnovers), 1.6 steals, shooting percentages of 54.4%/30.0%/88.7%.
