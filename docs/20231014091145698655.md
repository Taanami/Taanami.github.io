 Can the first team of Hangzhou Asian Games beat the second team of Chinese men's basketball and Korea? Yesterday's Asian Games men's basketball game was full of surprises, with both Korea and the Chinese men's basketball team, who came out with a strong lineup, showing an unstable performance. Korea fell behind from the beginning of the game and struggled to defend against the outside shooting of the Japanese team. Although the Chinese team won against Mongolia, they were constantly torn apart by the speed and found themselves in a difficult situation. The lack of preparation and unclear defensive strategies may make their journey in the next round even more challenging.

They finished 17th in the previous World Cup and secured their spot in next year's Paris Olympics, jumping to 26th in the world rankings, making them a new power in Asian men's basketball. Except for 18-year-old Kawaishima Yuto who plays abroad, the rest of the Japanese team consists of domestic league players who have not participated in international competitions. There are not even any naturalized players, so they were not highly regarded in this year's Hangzhou Asian Games.

In contrast, Korea sent out their top players, including naturalized player Ra Gun-a, high-quality guards Kim Sun-hyeon, Heo Hun, Byun Jun-hyeong, Kwon Seong-hyeon, and big men Ha Yoon-geun and Lee Seong-hyeon. They have a solid line-up in every position and are expected to compete for a medal.

With both teams winning their first two games, their matchup will determine who will advance to the next round as the first place in their group. However, the game took an unexpected turn as Japan started with a 13-0 run, with Korea struggling to catch up. In the second quarter, Japan's Kaya Juta continued to hit shots from the outside, and both teams engaged in a three-point shooting battle. Japan had a stable shooting performance with multiple players contributing, while Korea relied solely on Ra Gun-a, Heo Hun, and Ha Yoon-geun. Japan ended the first half with a 6-point lead.

After halftime, Japan went on a 5-0 run to extend their lead to 11 points, but Korea fought back with their twin towers inside, tying the game at 48. However, Japan changed their strategy, attacking with speed and then switching to outside shooting. Ichikawa Masato hit two three-pointers to regain momentum and maintain their lead over Korea.

In the final quarter, Korea focused on attacking the paint and had some success, while Japan struggled to score. However, with Kaya Juta and Heo Hun leading the way, Korea couldn't catch up as more and more players stepped up for Japan. Japan eventually won 83-77, leaving everyone in shock.

Heo Hun scored 24 points with 6 three-pointers, while their big men each contributed 12 points. However, Korea's biggest issue was their defense. Despite their poor shooting, Japan made 17 three-pointers, with Kaya Juta scoring 22 points, leading the team to a collective victory.

After securing their spot in the next round as the top team in their group, the Chinese team needed to win their last game to advance as the second place. Although they had a huge lead, they faced a challenging game against Mongolia yesterday.

In the first quarter, both teams were evenly matched, with China scoring in the half-court and Mongolia using their speed to transition. In the second quarter, Xie Yaxuan came off the bench to hit a three-pointer, extending their lead to 6 points. However, Mongolia's fast-paced offense didn't stop, constantly rotating their players and shooting as soon as they got the ball. They tore apart China's defense and took the lead. If it weren't for the main players stepping up, China would have been even further behind. Please continue reading In the second half, Mongolia continued to lead, with China struggling to rebound and protect the paint. It wasn't until Abassi was fouled for unsportsmanlike conduct that they regained the lead. However, Mongolia went on a 5-0 run right before the end of the game, almost taking away their hard-earned lead. Fortunately, China held on to win 78-75 and advance to the next round. Mongolia had a good shooting performance, hitting 11 three-pointers compared to China's 19 shots with only 5 going in. They also caused 15 turnovers and converted them into 16 points, using their speed to their advantage. China's top players, Abassi with 27 points and 8 rebounds, and Atinuo with 18 points and 4 steals, led the team. However, the CBA duo had a poor shooting night, and the other players were quiet, making it difficult to keep up with the game in the middle. China, who had a clear advantage in the paint, should have easily won against Mongolia, who were not considered a traditional powerhouse in five-on-five basketball. However, they were in a tough situation throughout the game, and it was clear that the team was not in their best form.

If we only look at the game statistics, we might think that the two teams are evenly matched. However, that is not the case. Japan didn't even send their top team, and their average age is under 30, with 3 players born after 2000. It's clear that they are focused on developing their young players. Mongolia is in a similar situation, not to mention that they are not a traditional powerhouse in five-on-five basketball. Watching the game and clips, it's clear that China and Korea didn't do enough preparation. They didn't understand their opponents' offensive strategies and key players, and their defense was the main reason for their struggles. Japan used a lot of screens to find open shooters, while Mongolia used their speed to tear apart China's defense and attack the basket.
