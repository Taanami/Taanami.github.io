  NBALonzoBall confirms absence for the new season, optimistic about post-surgery recovery

Today, Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball discussed his injury issues on a podcast with Trae Young, where he revealed that he will be missing the entire 2023-24 season.

"I just underwent a major surgery, and I hope this is the last surgery I have to go through," Ball said on Young's podcast, "From the Point."

"It's been a long process. I've already ruled myself out for the next season. When I first got injured, we didn't really know the exact nature of the injury. I saw various doctors and specialists, and my condition was up and down. It's been really tough for me because I didn't know what the next day would bring. But now, at least I've had the surgery, we have a plan moving forward, and I'm on the right track."

Chicago Bulls Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations, Arturas Karnisovas, stated in June that despite Ball's long-term absence, they are not considering giving up on him or extending his contract. "I hope everything goes smoothly," Ball said. "I'm just leaving it all up to God, doing my best, and accepting the outcome."

Lonzo Ball, 25 years old, last played for the Chicago Bulls on January 14, 2022, against the Golden State Warriors. He left the game early due to discomfort in his left knee, later revealing that he was dealing with bone contusions and a torn meniscus.

Initially, it was expected that he would return at the start of the playoffs, but Ball's left knee continued to be painful, forcing him to restart the rehabilitation process, and the team decided to rest him for the remaining time this year.

Throughout the strengthening program and daily training, Ball's pain did not alleviate, leading him to undergo a second surgery in September 2022.

After the second surgery, there was belief that he would be able to return to on-court activities this year, but that did not happen. Unable to perform simple tasks like jumping and climbing stairs, Ball chose to undergo cartilage transplantation surgery on his left knee in March 2023, reportedly the best choice for his NBA career recovery.
