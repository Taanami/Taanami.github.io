The 2023 FIBA World Cup Warm-up Game in New Taipei City, organized by the T1 League, New Taipei City Government, and HAN Creation Sports Marketing, will invite three national teams from Latvia, Lithuania, and Puerto Rico to compete in three warm-up games on August 19, 20, and 22 at the New Taipei City Xinzhuang Gymnasium. For seasoned basketball fans, they may have witnessed the iconic moment when the USA Dream Team, consisting of players like Michael Jordan and Karl Malone, won the gold medal undefeated at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

However, more attention may be drawn to Lithuania, who won the bronze medal. Each player wore a colorful jersey with a skull dunking pattern during the awards ceremony.

Read on, as this jersey is not just a piece of clothing, but a symbol of freedom and belief.

Basketball in Lithuania is not just a sport, but a spiritual pursuit. Arnoldas Kulboka, who briefly played for the NBA's Charlotte Hornets, once said, "Basketball in Lithuania is like a religion."

And the numbers prove that Kulboka is not exaggerating. In 2015, the four highest-rated TV broadcasts in Lithuania were all games of the Lithuanian men's basketball team in the 2015 EuroBasket.

During the 2018-19 season, Žalgiris Kaunas, a Lithuanian team, attracted an average of 14,737 spectators per game in the regular season of the European league, setting a historical record for European leagues.

According to official statistics, Lithuania's total population in 2023 is less than 2.9 million, even fewer than New Taipei City, only slightly more than Taichung and Kaohsiung. However, this country in Eastern Europe, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, holds a significant position in the history of world basketball. As early as 2018, outstanding Lithuanian players like Lamelo Ball, Arvydas Sabonis and his son Domantas Sabonis, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and Jonas Valančiūnas have successfully made their mark in the NBA. Frank Lubin is hailed as the father of Lithuanian basketball.

Why does Lithuania, in a Europe where football is almost a national obsession, have such a deep love for basketball? The answer can be traced back to the 1930s when Frank Lubin, a Lithuanian-American known as Pranas, brought basketball culture to Lithuania. As a player and coach, Lubin led Lithuania to win consecutive championships in the 1937 and 1939 EuroBasket. Soon, basketball became the most popular sport in Lithuania.

On June 14, 1940, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia were militarily occupied by the Soviet Union and later annexed as Soviet republics. Basketball became the greatest spiritual belief for the Lithuanian people who lost their sovereignty. The pride that Lithuanian basketball players could feel was to reclaim their dignity through basketball. "During the Soviet era, basketball was the only way to show that you are Lithuanian, especially when you defeated CSKA Moscow," explained Arvydas Sabonis, who experienced both the Soviet and post-independence eras.

CSKA Moscow, established in 1923, is one of the oldest basketball teams in Russia and won four European league championships during the Soviet era. They were one of the main teams where Soviet basketball national team players played. CSKA's biggest rival within the Soviet Union was Žalgiris Kaunas from Lithuania. Žalgiris Kaunas defeated CSKA in 1985, 1986, and 1987, winning the Soviet Super League championship consecutively. "It was a peaceful battle through sports," said Alvydas Pazdrazdis, a member of the Lithuanian team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. "To outsiders, it was just a game, but for us, it was more than just a game." "The games between Žalgiris Kaunas and CSKA actually helped us establish national consciousness and contributed to the rise of national sports organizations like Sąjūdis, eventually leading to our independence," added Arvydas Sabonis.

However, basketball also brought frustration to Lithuanian players who were still under Soviet rule. Although players like Šarūnas Marčiulionis successfully challenged the NBA in 1989 after much effort, most Lithuanian players had no say in which team's jersey they would wear. "CSKA took me away like that," said Rimas Kurtinaitis, born in 1960, who played for CSKA from 1981 to 1983 before returning to his hometown team, Žalgiris Kaunas. He recalled, "For me, playing for CSKA was better than serving in the regular army or being assigned to some forest in Siberia."
