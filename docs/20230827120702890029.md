 The San Antonio Spurs were interested in acquiring Austin Reaves with a four-year, $100 million contract, but ultimately backed off as the Los Angeles Lakers were willing to match any offer. According to a report by Jovan Buha of The Athletic, the Spurs considered offering Reaves two contract options: one worth $100 million over four years, and another worth $60 million over three years. In both scenarios, if the Lakers matched the offer, Reaves' salary in the last two years would have skyrocketed due to the Arenas provision. Ultimately, the Lakers' insistence on matching any offer scared off the Spurs and other potential suitors with available salary space.
