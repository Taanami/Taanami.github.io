 Bridges因砸擋風玻璃違反保護令再度遭到逮捕，讓黃蜂隊陷入多災多難的局面。隊友們對於這起事件表示震驚，並希望Bridges能夠面對自己的行為並做出改變。黃蜂隊目前尚未對此事發表任何聲明。

Miles Bridges, a player for the NBA's Charlotte Hornets, has been arrested once again for violating a restraining order. According to local media reports, Bridges did not physically harm the person protected by the order, but instead broke a window. The Hornets have not commented on the incident.

Last year, Bridges was charged with domestic violence and in November, he pleaded guilty to assaulting the mother of his children in front of them. He was sentenced to three years probation and a ten-year restraining order, as well as weekly drug and marijuana tests and paying restitution to the victim. Bridges was only allowed to return to the court in July and signed a $7.9 million contract with the Hornets during the summer, but he was required to sit out 10 games before being able to play.

Bridges' latest arrest for breaking a window in violation of the restraining order has put the Hornets in a difficult situation. His teammates have expressed shock at the news and hope that Bridges will take responsibility for his actions and make changes. The Hornets have not yet made a statement on the matter.
