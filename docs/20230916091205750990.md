 The Blurred Pros and Cons of the 2023 World Cup: The United States is Ultimately Just a Strong Team, Not an Invincible Powerhouse

Certainly, before the game against Lithuania, the United States team had already secured a top-two spot in Group J of the second round, advancing to the quarterfinals, and had even secured a spot in next year's Paris Olympics. However, by the standards set by the United States in various fields, they are still considered to be the favored side to win as the world's number one basketball powerhouse.

But Lithuania refused to accept defeat, or rather, they once again put the United States in a situation where they fell behind at the start of the game. Unlike the United States' previous five opponents in the World Cup, Lithuania only allowed the United States to lead for 1 minute and 18 seconds within the first two minutes of the game. Even though the United States team made a strong comeback in the second half, Lithuania did not allow them to make any progress and ultimately won the game 110-104, handing the United States their first loss in the World Cup.

Since the 2016 Rio Olympics, the United States has been unable to maintain a perfect record in their recent three international competitions. Please continue reading. 

Of course, we cannot deny that Lithuania was incredibly accurate in this game. They were, in fact, the most accurate outside shooting team in the World Cup thus far. Not only did they make 6 out of 6 three-pointers in the first quarter and all 9 attempts before the start of the game, but also 14 of Lithuania's three-pointers came from 9 different players, including their main center Jonas Valanciunas. All 11 players who entered the game took shots from beyond the three-point line. Even when Anthony Edwards was closely defended by Mindaugas Kuzminskas with less than 3 minutes and 52 seconds left in the fourth quarter, he still made a difficult three-pointer. And with 1 minute and 43 seconds remaining, Tomas Dimsa successfully made another three-pointer, extending the lead to 11 points. These two three-pointers dealt a heavy blow to the United States. Despite having almost flawless defense, the United States still couldn't stop Lithuania's seemingly destined shots, ultimately making their comeback efforts in vain. Only focusing on three-pointers would be ignoring Lithuania's true strength. Jonas Valanciunas, a center, has faced challenges from one ball-handling core after another in the NBA due to his vulnerability in high pick-and-roll defense. However, under FIBA rules that allow zone defense and dominant play in the paint by centers, Valanciunas has become a powerful and versatile low-post scorer. With the long-term cohesion and basketball IQ of the national team, he is truly a dominant center under FIBA rules. Like Nikola Vucevic, the main center for Montenegro in the previous game against the United States, both players have showcased their talents on the FIBA court, allowing the world to see the brilliance of European star centers. Additionally, Lithuania's tallest player is 6 feet 4 inches, and all their guards are strong defenders. The inside players, including Valanciunas, provide solid screens and tough defense. Lithuania's team consensus to play tough games, active off-ball movement, and preparedness for both offense and defense make them a feared powerhouse on the world stage. Please continue reading.

This was fully reflected in their competition against the United States. Of course, the incredible three-point shooting in the first quarter was the key to their early lead. However, Lithuania's biggest victory in the game was their aggressive style of play, which allowed them to establish an early advantage in rebounds and off-ball crashes. Except for Jaren Jackson Jr. and the strong Edwards, the other three starters for the United States were at a disadvantage in their matchups against Lithuania. Even with Tyrese Haliburton and Brandon Ingram, who have relatively better physical attributes in the second unit, Lithuania still managed to find Austin Reaves through team screens. Lithuania outrebounded the United States 43 to 27 and had a 17-2 advantage in second-chance points. For example, at the end of the third quarter, Kuzminskas grabbed an offensive rebound and scored, maintaining a safe distance from the United States' second unit. Fortunately, Lithuania had accumulated enough second-unit attacks in the first three quarters to maintain their lead. Otherwise, if Lithuania had only grabbed one offensive rebound in the fourth quarter and allowed the United States to score, the comeback attempt could have been successful. As for the United States, in the preliminary rounds, they replaced Ingram, who was in a slump, with Josh Hart in the starting lineup to pair with Mikal Bridges and Jalen Brunson, both champions from Villanova. However, this starting lineup was a clear "one big, four small" lineup, which means that only Edwards was the main offensive threat. Bridges and Hart, who are considered "functional wing players" with some offensive explosiveness, or Bridges' offensive breakout after joining the Brooklyn Nets, may make them look more than just functional players. However, fundamentally, they are not like Valanciunas, who can dismantle opponents' defenses in the low post with force or superstars like Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, or at least Dwyane Wade, who can score in high-level games. Indeed, from the composition of the United States' starting lineup or the entire team's selection, we can see that the United States has many outstanding functional players. However, in this game against Lithuania, the weaknesses of this lineup became evident.
