New Taipei Kings, a team in the Eastern Super League, announced on September 8th that they have signed power forward Billy Preston from the United States. Billy, who is young but has experience playing professional basketball in multiple countries, will be the team's third foreign player. The Kings hope that Billy can contribute on both ends of the court.

Billy hails from California and is currently 25 years old. Standing at 208 cm tall, he was rated as a five-star high school player during his student years. He received recruitment offers from top NCAA schools, with the University of Kansas being one of them. Billy is known for his impressive athleticism, as well as his excellent shooting from the perimeter. His exceptional ability to penetrate often creates scoring opportunities for his team. Although he did not receive much attention in the 2018 NBA Draft, he later played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the summer league and signed a two-way contract with their G League team, the Canton Charge. This marked the beginning of his professional career. He has since played in professional leagues in other countries, with his most recent stint being with the Cape Town Tigers in the South African Basketball League, where he averaged 16.6 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. 

Regarding Billy's addition to the team, General Manager Mao Jian said, "Billy can be considered a modern-day stretch four player, with great athleticism and the ability to both slash to the basket and shoot from outside. His agility and height provide the Kings with added defensive intensity. At just 25 years old, he is a young player with unlimited potential. We are very excited to see how he will complement Morin and Manny in the upcoming season, and we believe that his presence will make our team more flexible in terms of lineup adjustments and help us achieve better results."
