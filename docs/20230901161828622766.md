 China was defeated by Serbia with a 42-point difference in their second game of Group B in the FIBA World Cup. In this game, China finally started Kyle Anderson, but fell behind in the first quarter and lost 105-63 in the end.

China's starting lineup for today's game was Zhao Rui, Kyle Anderson, Zhang Zhenlin, Zhou Peng, and Zhou Qi. Zhang Zhenlin scored seven points, including a four-point play, in the opening quarter, and the game was competitive in the first few minutes. However, China's second unit was substituted in after five minutes, and the score quickly widened to more than ten points.

After the second quarter, China couldn't catch up with Serbia. Every player from Serbia contributed points, and China struggled to defend against their aggressive offense. Serbia's ball movement was fast and efficient throughout the game, and they even opened up a 40-point lead in the fourth quarter. China's starting lineup performed decently, except for naturalized player Kyle Anderson, who scored 0 points and only managed to get 4 points and 4 rebounds with poor shooting. Anderson's weakness has always been his individual offense, and he needs to better utilize the space created by his teammates. Zhao Rui had the highest score for China with 17 points, followed by Zhou Qi with 12 points and 5 rebounds, and Zhang Zhenlin with 9 points only in the first quarter. The bench players contributed a total of 16 points.
