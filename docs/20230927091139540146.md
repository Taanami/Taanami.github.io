  NBA Eastern Conference Finals: Celtics stun Heat with last-second shot to tie series 3-3

The Boston Celtics were on the brink of elimination, trailing 0-3 in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat. However, they managed to pull off a thrilling victory in Game 6, defeating the Heat 104-103. With this win, the Celtics have now won three consecutive games and leveled the series, giving themselves a chance to make history.

In the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, the Miami Heat had dominated the first three games, leading 3-0. But the Celtics fought back, winning Games 4 and 5 to narrow the deficit. In Game 6, the Heat still held a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series.

The game was closely contested from the start. With the score tied at 20-20, Robert Williams III and Jayson Tatum made key plays to give the Celtics a 6-0 run, allowing them to finish the first quarter with a 34-29 lead. In the second quarter, the Celtics extended their lead to double digits at 52-41, but the Heat responded with a 12-5 run to cut the deficit. The Celtics held a 57-53 lead at halftime.

The Celtics' shooting efficiency in the first half, with a field goal percentage of 51.3%, played a crucial role in their lead. However, their three-point shooting was only 20%, far behind the Heat's 60%, which prevented them from widening the gap.

In the second half, the Heat made a comeback and narrowed the margin to just two points after Gabe Vincent's layup. But the Celtics, led by Marcus Smart and Al Horford, responded with key baskets to extend their lead. With a three-pointer from Williams III and two successful free throws from Jaylen Brown, the Celtics took a 13-point lead. Despite Kyle Lowry's efforts to bring the Heat closer, the Celtics maintained their lead at 79-72 by the end of the third quarter.

In the fourth quarter, the Heat started strong with an 11-3 run, taking an 83-82 lead after Duncan Robinson's three-pointer and Jimmy Butler's layup. However, the Celtics countered with an 8-0 run to regain a 90-83 lead. Butler, who struggled in the first three quarters, came alive in the fourth quarter, scoring 15 points and hitting all three free throws in the final three seconds to give the Heat a one-point lead. They had a chance to seal the victory and advance to the NBA Finals. However, Marcus Smart missed a three-pointer, and Derrick White made a last-second shot to secure the win for the Celtics.

No team in NBA playoff history has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit to win a series. The Celtics, after three consecutive losses, have now won three straight games to level the series. If they can win Game 7 at home on the 30th, they will create history. 

Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with a game-high 31 points and 11 rebounds, while Jaylen Brown contributed 26 points and 10 rebounds. Marcus Smart provided a crucial boost with 21 points.

For the Heat, Jimmy Butler struggled for most of the game, scoring only 9 points on 2-of-15 shooting. However, he had a remarkable fourth quarter, scoring 15 points and giving the Heat a temporary lead. Butler finished with 24 points and 11 rebounds. Caleb Martin contributed 21 points and 15 rebounds, and Bam Adebayo recorded a double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds.

The Celtics now have the opportunity to become the first team in NBA history to overcome a 3-0 series deficit. Game 7 will take place on Monday at 8:30 PM ET on TNT.
