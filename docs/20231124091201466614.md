  2023 Season Analysis of the Los Angeles Clippers at the Crossroads of Rebuilding

"I know we have disappointed a lot of people. This year will be different, we will definitely make everyone proud." These words from Ivica Zubac at the preseason media day may best express the feelings of Clippers fans in recent years.

In the fifth year of assembling a luxury warship, the Los Angeles Clippers' season losses have always been used to comfort themselves with injuries as an excuse. "Imagine if there were no injuries...the Clippers would definitely be on top." Last season, after waiting for a whole season, Kawhi Leonard finally returned to the team, but his performance was still disappointing, and the team could only barely make it to the playoffs. In the end, they once again ended their season with the old excuse of "injuries."

With Kawhi Leonard and Paul George both entering their 33rd and 32nd year, and facing upcoming contract negotiations, the dismantling and rebuilding of this team is just around the corner. From Chris Paul all the way to Kawhi Leonard! Looking back at the Clippers' "curse-like" history of star injuries [Roster Changes] In: Kobe Brown (first-round pick), Kenyon Martin Jr. (trade), Jordan Miller, Joshua Primo (two-way contracts) Out: Eric Gordon (released), Jason Preston (released) The Clippers had minimal changes this summer. Thanks to the friendly extensions of Russell Westbrook and Mason Plumlee, the team did not lose two important players and maintained almost the same roster. They also acquired Kenyon Martin Jr. from the Rockets through a small trade, adding a young player to the team.

The only loss that is a concern is the release of shooter Eric Gordon due to salary pressure.

Key players this season: The league's second-best superstar team If the Phoenix Suns are the team with the most potential to play "superstar basketball" next season, I think the Clippers can compete for second place. Ironically, this season will be the second time in five years since this team was formed that we can see a fully healthy Kawhi and George at the start of the season. Despite the fact that in the past four seasons, the two of them have spent almost half of their time on the sidelines, it cannot be denied that as long as they are healthy and on the court, the team's strength is not a concern, and they are still a team that is guaranteed to make it to the playoffs. In last season's playoffs, Kawhi scored 38 and 31 points in two consecutive games against the Suns, proving himself to be a cold-blooded +2 machine. As for George, before he got injured, he also carried the team in the regular season, showing his all-around skills. The two of them make up one of the few power forward combinations in the NBA that possess both size and offensive and defensive abilities. If we add in Russell Westbrook, who averaged 23.6 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game in the playoffs, proving once again his worth as a superstar, there is no doubt that the potential ceiling brought by these three players is enough for people to give the Clippers some respect.

For the Clippers, the optimistic expectation is for the three stars to have a better chemistry. They only played together for a total of 10 games and 230 minutes last season, which is a very small sample size. Compared to the failed partnership between John Wall and Westbrook, Westbrook has a history of playing with star power forwards such as George and Carmelo Anthony, so he is more familiar with playing alongside star forwards and can avoid any negative effects. Even if they cannot achieve the 1+1+1>3 synergy, I believe the worst-case scenario is that it will still be 1+1+1=3.

Secondly, both Kawhi and George are versatile forwards who can switch between playing with and without the ball, and can even simply focus on scoring. This is more in line with Kawhi's previous offensive style.

Looking at the data, Westbrook is also more willing to adapt to the team's changes in playing style compared to Wall, and is more involved in the team's off-ball offense.

According to Synergy data, 36.8% of Westbrook's possessions with the Clippers last season ended in turnovers, fouls, or shots, which is much lower than his 49% ratio with the Lakers and lower than Reggie Jackson's (42.2%) and John Wall's (46.6%) with the Clippers.

In addition, the Clippers also have a group of talented guards such as Norman Powell and Bones Hyland, who are all capable of scoring at will. Powell scored 37 points in one game last season, and Hyland also contributed 20 points in one game.

If they can fully utilize the star power to attract defenders, and with reasonable rotation, the individual offensive abilities of these five players can create an aggressive and dominant offensive style.

This season's weakness: Traditional and undersized depth

When head coach Ty Lue showed a five-forward lineup during the 2022-23 preseason, I was looking forward to the "Forward Sea" finally coming together. However, it turned out to be just a fleeting moment.

Today, the Clippers' current roster is no longer modernized. The two veteran forwards who made up the "Forward Sea," Nicolas Batum and Marcus Morris, are both facing aging and decline in both offense and defense. Batum can no longer play more than 20 minutes per game, and Morris was even benched at the end of last season. Robert Covington, who was seen as a key addition, has not been given much playing time by Ty Lue. Young players like Amir Coffey and Kobe Brown are not ready to fill in, which means the Clippers only have Kawhi and George as their two big wings. If they choose to play with a 3-4 lineup and move Terance Mann to the shooting guard position, their bench will appear weak and undersized.

When the Clippers face injuries, Ty Lue can only rely on 195cm Luke Kennard as the shooting guard, or push 185cm Reggie Jackson up to defend against taller and stronger guards in the league, which is obviously a difficult task.

Conclusion: This season will be a crucial turning point for the Los Angeles Clippers. Whether it's the stars' contracts, the aging of the roster, or rebuilding the team, they will face their biggest challenge this year. However, if they can overcome these difficulties and regain their stability and competitiveness, they still have a chance to continue rising in this league. So let's look forward to the Clippers' performance in the new season together!
