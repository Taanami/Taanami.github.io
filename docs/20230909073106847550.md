# The blurred pros and cons of the 2023 World Cup: the United States is ultimately a strong team rather than an invincible powerhouse 
 The blurred pros and cons of the 2023 World Cup: the United States is ultimately a strong team rather than an invincible powerhouse.

Although the US team had already secured a top two finish in Group J of the second round and advanced to the quarterfinals before the game against Lithuania, and even secured a spot in next year's Paris Olympics, according to the standards set by the US in various fields, they are still considered to be the favored side as the number one basketball powerhouse in the world.

However, Lithuania refused to surrender, or rather, they once again put the US in a situation where they fell behind at the start of the game. Unlike the previous five opponents of the US in this World Cup, Lithuania was different in that they only allowed the US to lead for 1 minute and 18 seconds within the first two minutes of the game. Even though the US team made a strong comeback in the second half, Lithuania did not let them take a single step forward. In the end, Lithuania defeated the star-studded US team with a score of 110-104, maintaining their undefeated record in the World Cup so far and handing the US team their first loss in this tournament.

Since the 2016 Rio Olympics, the US has failed to maintain a perfect record in their last three international competitions. Please continue reading. Of course, we cannot deny that Lithuania played exceptionally well in this game. Indeed, Lithuania has been the most accurate team from beyond the arc in this World Cup so far. Not only did they make all 9 of their three-point attempts before the start of the game, but they also made a total of 14 three-pointers throughout the game, with contributions from 9 different players, including their main center Jonas Valanciunas. In fact, all 11 players who played in the game attempted shots from beyond the arc. In the fourth quarter, with only 3 minutes and 52 seconds left, Mindaugas Kuzminskas made a difficult three-pointer with Anthony Edwards defending closely, and with 1 minute and 43 seconds remaining, Tomas Dimsa successfully hit another three-pointer to extend the lead to 11 points. These two three-pointers dealt a severe blow to the US. Strictly speaking, the US defense had almost no flaws, yet Lithuania seemed to have luck on their side and ultimately prevented the US from catching up despite their efforts.

To only mention three-pointers would be to overlook Lithuania's true strength. Center Jonas Valanciunas has always been challenged by NBA ball-handling guards due to his weak high pick-and-roll defense. He has been tested by guards from the Pelicans and his previous teams time and time again. However, under FIBA rules that allow for zone defense and dominant play by centers in the paint, Valanciunas has become a powerful and versatile force, relying on his strength and low post offensive skills. Coupled with the chemistry and basketball IQ developed through long-term collaboration with the national team, Valanciunas is undoubtedly a star center under FIBA rules. Like the starting center for the US team's previous opponent, Nikola Vucevic from Montenegro, these European star centers have showcased their skills on the FIBA stage. Additionally, Lithuania's shortest player on the team is 6 feet 4 inches tall, and all their guards are strong in matchups. The solid screens and strong defense from the Lithuanian frontcourt players, including Valanciunas, made it difficult for opponents who were not expecting physicality. With a collective agreement to play tough on the court, active movement from shooters, and everyone prepared to compete on both ends of the court, Lithuania remains a formidable power on the world stage, even without NBA star Domantas Sabonis.

This was fully demonstrated in their competition against the US. Of course, the key to Lithuania's significant lead in the first quarter was their incredible three-point shooting, but the biggest factor in their victory throughout the game was their aggressive style of play. They established an early advantage in rebounding and off-ball hustle, as the US starting lineup, apart from the tall Jaren Jackson Jr. and the strong Edwards, was always at a disadvantage in their matchups against Lithuania. Even though the second unit of the US had Tyrese Haliburton and Brandon Ingram, who excel in their respective positions, Lithuania always found ways to exploit Austin Reaves with team coverage. Lithuania outrebounded the US 43 to 27, and their second unit had a commanding lead of 17 to 2 in scoring. Just before the end of the third quarter, Kuzminskas grabbed an offensive rebound and scored, allowing Lithuania to maintain a safe distance from the US's second unit going into the fourth quarter. Thankfully, Lithuania had accumulated enough of an advantage in the first three quarters to hold onto the lead. Otherwise, if Lithuania had only secured one more offensive rebound and allowed the US to score, the US's comeback attempt could have been successful. As for the US, in the group stage, they replaced Ingram with Josh Hart in the starting lineup to address Ingram's slump. This meant that the starting lineup consisted of Hart, Mikal Bridges, and Jalen Brunson, the Villanova champions' connection. However, this starting lineup was essentially a "one big, four small" lineup without any ambiguity. This also indicates that apart from Edwards, the only player in the starting lineup with attacking abilities, Bridges and Hart are considered "functional wing players" who have received some praise in recent years, or Bridges, after his offensive breakout since joining the Nets, appears to be "more than just a functional player." However, fundamentally speaking, they are not like Valanciunas, who can dismantle opponents' defenses with brute force in the low post, or like Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, or at least Dwyane Wade, who can score in high-level games as superstars. Indeed, from the selection of this US starting lineup, or the overall composition of the team, we can see that the US has many outstanding functional players. However, in this game against Lithuania, the shortcomings of this lineup were evident.
