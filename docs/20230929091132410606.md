 The Controversial Contract Issue of Lin Bing-Sheng - How Should Athletes Be Aware When Signing Contracts? Roundtable Sports Conference

Although the law cannot make everyone equal, everyone is equal before the law; although the law restrains us, it also protects us accordingly.

In August 2023, a player dispute involving cross-league and repeated contract signings took place in the Taiwan professional basketball league. The main character in this dispute was Lin Bing-Sheng, a professional basketball player.

Lin Bing-Sheng was originally a member of the T1 championship team, the CTBC Bank Taipower. On August 15th, Lin Bing-Sheng signed a contract with the PLG Hsinchu Attack Lions as a free agent. However, the next day, Lin Bing-Sheng posted on his personal Instagram, expressing that due to career planning considerations, he declined to join the Attack Lions before the team made an official announcement. The Attack Lions immediately publicly revealed parts of the contract, stating that the player had clearly expressed his intention and signed a "delegation contract," but then unilaterally terminated it. The Attack Lions urged Lin Bing-Sheng to fulfill his contractual obligations and accused the T1 Taipower of maliciously poaching.

However, the T1 Taipower refuted that all procedures were "in compliance with regulations." Therefore, after a coordination meeting in September, in which Lin Bing-Sheng did not participate, and no consensus was reached between the Basketball Association and the teams after two hours of coordination, the Attack Lions officially filed a lawsuit against Lin Bing-Sheng and the Taipower.

While enthusiasm is high, both the league and the teams need to establish a genuine professional basketball culture and an orderly system to ensure long-term development. Both teams also expressed during the meeting that more comprehensive fair competition regulations and related systems should be established to meet the needs of all parties and adapt to the rapidly changing professional basketball environment. However, we are curious, can a player who has signed a contract post on social media without reporting to the team? How can malicious poaching be prevented between different leagues using legal means? Can other teams sign players before the original team announces non-renewal? Can a player who has signed a "delegation contract" not fulfill their obligations? Yang Gui-Zhi, co-founder of Plain Language Law, stated in the Roundtable Sports Conference: Whether Lin Bing-Sheng needs to comply with contract provisions depends on the type of contract he signed. Although the Attack Lions publicly claimed to have signed a "delegation contract" with Lin Bing-Sheng, the nature of the contract is not determined by the title but by its content.

As the professional basketball contract is non-standardized and considered a business secret, all terms cannot be disclosed. Therefore, let's first discuss whether it is a delegation contract. According to Article 549 of the Civil Code, in a delegation contract, either party can terminate the contract at any time. Even if there is a stipulated period or special provision that termination is not allowed, it is still generally believed that either party can terminate at any time because delegation is a task entrusted to you but does not require you to complete it. Therefore, from a legal perspective, Lin Bing-Sheng can terminate the contract at any time and play for another team. However, if this termination causes any harm to the Attack Lions (such as image, marketing, promotion, contract costs, etc.), compensation for damages would still be required. Please continue reading. If it is not a delegation contract but a "contract for services," a contract for services is more binding. Its definition is an agreement for someone to help you complete a certain task and ensure that the task is completed according to the agreed standards.

However, the possibility of signing a contract for services on the sports field is very low because the sports field is constantly changing, and we cannot guarantee the outcome of a particular event. For example, a player may get injured, or the tactical utilization by the coach each season may prevent every player from being able to play. This is also the case in life. If you hire a lawyer to handle a lawsuit, the lawsuit itself is very complex, and the lawyer cannot guarantee a win because there are risks and unknown factors in litigation. When you see a doctor or undergo surgery, although the doctor takes on your request, they cannot guarantee that you will recover because everyone's physical condition is different. Therefore, it is difficult to use a contract for services for litigation or medical treatment. On the other hand, a contract for services can be used when buying a house because the house needs to be built on time and meet certain standards. It cannot be a house made of sand or with radiation, etc. If the house is not built properly or leaks, penalties can be imposed. This type of contract is determined based on the outcome. But if a delegation contract can be terminated at any time and a contract for services cannot guarantee the outcome, what other type of contract can be used? There is a type of contract called an "employment contract," which is similar to the employment relationship of ordinary office workers. This means that to some extent, the player's decision-making power is restricted by the team. For example, is the player's salary paid on time and fixed? Are there clear restrictions on the location and time of work? Will the player receive payment regardless of performance? Is collaboration with others necessary to complete the work?
