 Germany staged a remarkable comeback in the first half and secured an impressive 29-point victory over Slovenia to remain undefeated in the FIBA World Cup. This game, between two unbeaten European teams, did not determine who would advance to the quarterfinals but rather who would finish first or second in the group. Germany overturned the deficit before the end of the first half and went on to defeat Slovenia. They will face either Latvia or Spain in their next game. 

During the first half, Germany trailed for most of the time and even fell behind by 14 points at one point. However, they managed to narrow the gap with an 11-0 run before halftime. In the second quarter, they limited Slovenia to only 9 points and took a four-point lead into halftime.

In the second half, Germany continued their strong defensive performance and showcased their scoring ability by scoring 62 points. They completely pulled away from Slovenia, who seemed to give up on the game early in the fourth quarter and substituted several bench players, including Luka Doncic.

In the end, Germany defeated Slovenia with a convincing score of 100-71, securing their spot as the group's first-place team in the final eight. Dennis Schroder led the scoring with 24 points and recorded 10 assists, while Daniel Theis contributed 14 points and 7 rebounds, and Isaac Bonga had 12 points and 5 rebounds. Luka Doncic scored 23 points, grabbed 6 rebounds, and dished out 6 assists, but unfortunately couldn't lead Slovenia to victory.
