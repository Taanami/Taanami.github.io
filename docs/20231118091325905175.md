  The Houston Rockets are attempting to trade Kevin Porter Jr. after an incident involving domestic violence. According to sources, the Rockets have reached out to multiple teams to trade Porter in exchange for draft picks. It is expected that Porter will not participate in the upcoming training camp.

 The 2023-24 season will be the first season of Porter's four-year, $82.5 million contract, with the first year being guaranteed. The Rockets are looking to acquire a player who can immediately contribute to the team.

 In a recent episode, ESPN reporter Woj stated, "The league has launched an investigation and they will handle it in the near future...There is no doubt that Porter's future with the Rockets and the NBA is in jeopardy." Last year, Miles Bridges was arrested for a domestic violence incident and ultimately missed the entire season (although he will return to the team for this upcoming training camp). According to ABC, Porter has pleaded not guilty to the charges of assaulting his girlfriend, a former WNBA player, and was released on a $75,000 bond.

 It has been reported that the judge issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting Porter from contacting his girlfriend. According to previous reports, Porter allegedly assaulted his girlfriend at a hotel in New York, resulting in a fractured vertebra in her neck and a cut above her right eye.
