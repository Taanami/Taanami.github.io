  2023 World Cup Germany vs Finland Live Notes

Germany advances as the first-place team in their group with a dominant performance, while Finland finishes the group stage with no wins.

In the previous game between Finland and Germany, despite Finland taking an early lead, Germany proved to be the only undefeated team in the group. After making adjustments and increasing the pressure in the second quarter, Germany pulled away, and Finland ended up losing all their games, finishing at the bottom of the group. After the game, surprise guest Nowitzki appeared near the interview area and exchanged handshakes with Schroder. Germany came prepared for this tournament, as they managed to come back and win against Australia, one of the top contenders for a medal. However, they faced some difficulties in the first quarter.

In the first quarter, Finland had good three-point shooting and defended Schroder, causing him to struggle. They managed to take a lead of 22-19. Before the start of the game, an interesting scene was Markkanen sitting on the bench and practicing his shooting form. However, after that, things didn't go well for Finland. Germany started to play zone defense and put pressure on the ball handlers. Finland lacked the necessary skills and physicality to counter this defensive strategy. Their shooting accuracy dropped after multiple attempts, and their overall lineup was not as strong as Germany's. They lacked scoring options apart from sporadic firepower and struggled to create good scoring opportunities due to their guards' inability to pass the ball to advantageous positions.

You may argue that Finland still had their star player Markkanen on the court. However, Germany made it a priority to target and limit him throughout the game. They assigned tough NBA forward Theis to guard him, making it uncomfortable for Markkanen to receive the ball. Even when Theis was off the court, Germany had MVP Bonga and Moritz Wagner to cover for him. The physical advantage of Germany's wing players in both offense and defense made it difficult for Markkanen. Finland's guards were also unable to pass the ball to Markkanen in positions where he could effectively initiate the offense, resulting in limited scoring opportunities for him. With the absence of three-point shooting threats and a lackluster overall lineup, Finland struggled to score.

As long as Theis was on the court, the game was focused on limiting Markkanen. However, it is worth admiring that Theis also had an excellent performance on the offensive end. In simple terms, for Germany, containing Markkanen meant almost defeating Finland. Throughout the game, there were intense collisions and double teams against him. Bonga, who had NBA experience, was unstoppable in attacking the rim and became the game's MVP. As Finland's energy declined and their three-point shooting disappeared, Germany reduced Schroder's ball-handling time. The German team emphasized ball movement and tried to stretch and exhaust Finland's defense, taking advantage of their declining energy levels. As the defense was pulled apart and Schroder found his rhythm, Germany went on a scoring spree. Finland stopped struggling, and Markkanen was taken off the court early. The game ended in garbage time. Initially, Schroder's play was too individualistic and ineffective, but after adjusting the balance between scoring and passing, and as the opponent became fatigued, he found his rhythm, and the game ended in Germany's favor. Finland's group stage performances were similar, starting strong but fading towards the end. They had some success when their energy levels were high, but as their stamina decreased, their three-point shooting became inconsistent. Opponents could easily defend Markkanen by double-teaming him, and Finland had few effective offensive options. In simple terms, Finland still has a long way to go to reach the level of their star player within the national team. It is difficult for their playing style and roles to single-handedly turn the tide in international competitions. If Finland wants to become a stable force in European basketball, they still have a lot of work to do.

What impressed me the most was that Finland is likely the team that had to travel the farthest to Okinawa for this tournament. However, they had the largest group of traveling supporters from their home country. I learned from chatting with them that each supporter had arranged around two weeks of time just to cheer for the national team. This passion for basketball in their home country is admirable. Let's see if Finland can develop a more long-term training system and if other players can bridge the gap with Markkanen. In this pre-tournament phase in Okinawa, many countries have organized travel groups to support their teams, and Finland's cheerleading squad is the largest. However, they still have to face the remaining two ranking matches, hoping to at least avoid going winless and increase their points difference (they are currently sixth in terms of points difference in the group stage). They have a higher chance of winning against Venezuela, but they are unfamiliar with Cape Verde, who gave Slovenia a tough time yesterday. If Cape Verde can maintain the performance that scared Slovenia, Finland might face another unexpected challenge. The good news is that this game will start today, and after a day of rest, Finland will face Cape Verde, who just had a hard-fought game against Slovenia. Let's see if Finland can perform well in the ranking matches and deliver some impressive performances for themselves and the fans who have traveled from afar. Finland did not have a game yesterday, and they went to the adjacent sports field for practice. Let's see if they can use their rest advantage to secure their first victory!
