In the 12-man roster for the Chinese men's basketball team, there are many talented local players joining the frontcourt. However, based on the performance in the Jones Cup, it seems that a suitable candidate for the starting lineup has not yet been found. With the confirmation that Chen Ying-Jun will not be able to participate in the Asian Games, Zeng Wen-Ding has been included in the roster. The question now is whether Li De-Wei, who excels in organization, and the agile Zeng Xiang-Jun will lose the opportunity to take over the frontcourt. Let's analyze this statement below.

Please continue reading â–¼ The evolution of tactics in the Jones Cup, the intersection of Li De-Wei and Zeng Xiang-Jun. In this year's Jones Cup, in addition to naturalized player Arto Tucker becoming the mainstay of the frontcourt, there are also 6 local players waiting on the sidelines. Li De-Wei, Zeng Xiang-Jun, and Chen Guan-Quan are the main substitutes, while Zhou Bo-Xun, Zeng Wen-Ding, and Wang Hao-Ji are the backup options. The team has a strong emphasis on strengthening the offense and defense in the paint.

However, in all 8 games, the team only averaged 38 rebounds per game, with only Arto Tucker contributing an average of 10.5 rebounds. The three main local players only contributed 7.9 rebounds per game, and their advantage over opponents was not significant. This does not mean that the team has a strong frontcourt. In fact, with the absence of backcourt players, the organization of the offense has become a major problem, which also affects the selection of frontcourt players. This will be a challenge that the team will face in the Asian Games. Li De-Wei was a regular starter in the first few games, as an inside player who can handle the ball, he helped relieve the pressure on Lin Ting-Qian, who was filling in as the point guard, by using a lot of high post and arc top ball handling techniques, as well as hand offs and screen-and-rolls, making "Chicago Action" the main tactic and highlighting his strengths among this group of frontcourt players.

As shown in the table above, his assist numbers were not bad against the Philippines and Japan, and he also contributed well in rebounds, with a decent plus-minus value. Although he lacks agility, his height and physical strength make him a solid defender in the paint, as evidenced by his average of 1.4 blocks per game. However, his highest scoring record was only 5 points, which shows that he was limited in his performance and was eventually moved to the bench. The crucial point was in the game against Qatar, where Lin Ting-Qian and Arto Tucker's pick and roll partnership allowed coach Stephon Marbury to find a new way to change the high post possession, trying to get the power forward more involved in the attack and adding more options.

Although Li De-Wei can shoot from the outside, his release is not fast enough. He can also back down in the low post, but lacks the skills and agility to get past his opponents. His efficiency in following up on rebounds is also not good, and his role is mainly to receive passes and grab offensive rebounds. In the later games, his plus-minus value dropped, proving that his effectiveness on the court was decreasing and his role was becoming unclear.

Please continue reading The little episode of this year's Jones Cup was when Zeng Xiang-Jun posted on his personal social media account, expressing his dissatisfaction with his lack of playing time. Although he didn't have many opportunities to play in the first few games, his stats were not bad and he was able to fulfill his role efficiently. His numbers were almost the same as his average, proving his consistency.

As everything changed as mentioned earlier, with Lin Ting-Qian leading the offense, there was an increased need for the power forward to be more involved in the attack. Zeng Xiang-Jun, with his quick outside shot, agility, and attacking ability, became the preferred option in the lineup. He made 2 three-pointers against the United Arab Emirates and the United States, and scored in double digits in the last 4 games. In the game against South Korea, he had a plus-minus value of 33, which opened up the space for half-court offense and increased the team's ability to run fast breaks, providing more offensive options for the Chinese team.

"Agility" is Zeng Xiang-Jun's advantage as a local power forward. With a balanced build of 205 cm and 95 kg, he is capable of playing the 5 out formation and the 1 big 4 small formation. He has a good sense of following up and has a mid-range offensive game, which makes him more suitable for modern basketball trends in both offense and defense. If the coaching staff remains unchanged in the short term, regardless of who becomes the head coach, Zeng Xiang-Jun will still be the first choice in the lineup. However, with only an average of 0.9 assists and 0.7 blocks per game, it is clear that he is mainly responsible for finishing the offense. Even though he is tall enough, his court reading and passing skills need improvement. Apart from handoffs and cross-court passes (for fast breaks), he can't really connect well with the center and power forward, which is the main reason why his effectiveness is limited when playing with Arto Tucker. In addition, he still needs to work on his awareness and instincts in pick and rolls, in order for the coach to have more options to use him.

Please continue reading In this open-ended question, who will get playing time in the Asian Games? As mentioned above, the two main local power forwards, Zeng Xiang-Jun and Li De-Wei, have completely different styles of play. One is a defensive and organizing player, while the other excels in offense and speed, bringing different dynamics to the Chinese team. In the Jones Cup, the playing time of these two players has been interchanging, not because of their poor performance, but because of the emphasis on tactics and ball handling. However, it is certain that both of them will be key players in the lineup, playing alongside naturalized players. Under normal circumstances, with the presence of the top three CBA players and quality local point guards, it is clear who will be the starters and substitutes. However, with the changes in the roster due to injuries, this question has become both open-ended and unpredictable. After Chen Ying-Jun confirmed his withdrawal from the Asian Games, Wu Yong-Sheng was added as a substitute. However, the reality of having no point guard is clear. Lin Ting-Qian is still filling in as the point guard, while Zeng Wen-Ding's re-selection makes the selection of local power forwards a no-brainer. It is safe to say that, apart from Zeng Xiang-Jun, the other power forwards may not have many opportunities to play. Even though Zeng Wen-Ding is already 39 years old, his efficient playing style, court reading, and ball handling skills make him a valuable asset for "winning games". Unless other players in different positions are performing very well, he will definitely get around 20 minutes of playing time. As for the changes in the roster, the author is disappointed. Winning medals may be important, but sacrificing the future is not worth it.
