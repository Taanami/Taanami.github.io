 The Players' Association declines the invitation to participate in the inter-league invitational tournament.

The 2023 Inter-League Basketball Invitational Tournament, organized by the Chinese Basketball Association (referred to as the CBA), will include the Asian Games Men's Basketball Team. After discussions among the team members, they hope to maintain their established training schedule and do not wish to participate in the related competition. To avoid a repeat of past issues, the Players' Association requests a positive response from the CBA regarding the Association's suggestions for establishing the "Procedures for Inviting Players to Participate in International Competitions" and the "Model Participation Agreement." The Association aims to discuss and implement tournament classification, eliminate communication barriers caused by information asymmetry, and create conditions for players to actively participate, allowing the national team to enter a more systematic and modernized approach. Furthermore, it is reiterated that "information transparency and open communication" have been the consistent principles advocated by the professional baseball union since 2013 for safeguarding players' rights in international competitions. The basketball union will also adhere to this principle. The players are not rejecting the opportunity to represent their country and pursue honor; rather, they hope that, before being labeled as "disregarding honor and pursuing personal gain," Taiwan basketball can reflect on why efforts and preparations in terms of systems and plans have not been made. Shouldn't we focus on laying the groundwork for "projects that truly benefit athletes' careers" before arranging for political leaders to kick off the game, present awards, host banquets, and distribute additional monetary rewards? And if change is necessary, when is the right time for it?
