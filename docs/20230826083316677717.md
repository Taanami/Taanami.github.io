  Memories of Mamba: A Tearful Recollection

Do you remember what you were doing on January 26, 2020? Please continue reading. It must be admitted that for the author, that day in Taiwan was just an ordinary day.

It wasn't until the morning of January 27, when scrolling through Facebook, that I was inundated with messages of R.I.P. At first, I thought it was some cruel hoax, so I quickly went downstairs and turned on the TV to watch CNN news. That's when I realized it was all true: a helicopter had crashed near Los Angeles on the morning of January 26, and all the people on board had tragically perished. The list of casualties shockingly included Kobe Bryant. Strictly speaking, I cannot be considered a die-hard Kobe fan, but I have a complex web of emotions towards him... is it love? Perhaps! After all, I witnessed his career from his debut until retirement.

Is it hatred? Perhaps! His confidence, his determination, and his audacity in repeatedly challenging Michael Jordan's legendary status made me feel impatient and annoyed. So when I learned of his departure, instead of feeling sadness, I felt as if a piece of my heart had been hollowed out, a sense of loss and melancholy. Today, August 23, is Kobe's birth anniversary, and tomorrow, August 24, is "Kobe Day." I always feel obligated to write something to commemorate him, but Kobe's career story is as rich as an encyclopedia, and everyone knows it by heart. It is beyond my abilities to recount every detail. So, instead, I will reminisce about the connection between Kobe and myself... 

1. KB8: Please continue reading. When Kobe left Adidas after his contract expired in 2002, KB8 was also renamed Crazy8. (Image source: Adidas) When Kobe first entered the NBA, he was a signed athlete for Adidas, and it was Sonny Vaccaro who recommended Adidas to sign him.

At that time, the basketball shoe market no longer belonged to Adidas, but to Nike, all thanks to Nike signing Michael Jordan in 1984! *Sonny Vaccaro's strategy for Adidas at the time was to sign student players with the potential to become stars (such as Kobe in 1996 and T-Mac in 1997). And what I am about to mention next is the first signature shoe that Adidas released for Kobe: the Equipment KB8 (hereinafter referred to as KB8). *Interestingly, Nike's signing with MJ was also facilitated by Sonny Vaccaro (for those who want to know this story, you can watch the movie "AIR").

Please continue reading. In 1998, it was Kobe's second NBA season, and he, along with his three Lakers teammates, S. O'Neal, E. Jones, and N. Van Exel, were selected for the NBA All-Star Game.

At that time, Kobe was still the sixth man for the Los Angeles Lakers, but with his popularity, he became a starter for the Western Conference All-Star team through fan voting! The spirited Kobe wore his KB8 sneakers and went head-to-head with MJ in the All-Star Game. Although the Eastern Conference All-Star team emerged victorious, and MJ scored the highest with 23 points, winning the MVP, the debutant Kobe also had an impressive 18 points! With similar builds and skills, and the confidence of a young calf unafraid of tigers, it seemed as if he was declaring, "I will carry on the legacy of the league's iconic torch!" The initial three colorways of KB8. The face pattern represents the symbol of Feet You Wear, indicating that the technology concept originated from human feet. (Image source: Adidas)

My connection with KB8 began in junior high school. It was my first pair of celebrity-endorsed shoes (Black/White edition). The upper was made of suede, and the sole featured the well-received "Feet You Wear" technology. My personal evaluation of these shoes is that they were both stylish and comfortable. The black suede exuded a luxurious and upscale feeling, while the "Feet You Wear" technology made it feel like walking barefoot â€“ truly comfortable! It's just a pity that my feet were still growing at the time, so I couldn't wear them for more than a year. Additionally, suede was difficult to maintain for a mischievous junior high school student! 

2. Magazine Covers: Since high school, I have had the habit of buying Chinese basketball magazines. The ones I regularly bought were HOOP and SLAM, and I would decide to buy XXL based on the cover or freebies. Kobe has been a hotshot in the league since his debut, naturally becoming the darling of magazine covers! Let me share with you a few issues of magazines with Kobe on the cover and talk about their stories:
