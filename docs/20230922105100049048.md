  2023 TGF World Firefighting Basketball Tournament Team Interview: We Don't Have Jerseys

One of the representatives in the senior division of the northern region for this tournament is our team, We Don't Have Jerseys. In fact, the team consists of players who have won the HBL Division 2 championship in the 106th, 108th, and 109th academic years. They come from traditional powerhouses such as Taitung High School, Xinhua High School of Industry and Commerce, Huideng High School, and Kaohsiung Vocational High School. This year, they not only participated in the senior division, but also achieved third place in the three-on-three competition. Moreover, the joyful atmosphere within the team, reminiscent of a group of brothers playing together, has accompanied them from high school to university, as they continue to grow and evolve. We look forward to seeing them on more basketball courts.

We are still familiar with each other and it brings back memories of our past experiences. Besides being nostalgic, I also cherish this opportunity."

Xie Wenxiang also served as the assist leader for the team in this year's tournament, consistently making brilliant plays. His connection with the team has made the rhythm of their game smoother. - Please continue reading As a participant in the senior division this year, team captain Xu Yuxuan said, "Being able to become teammates with opponents from different places and experience something different feels quite fresh. It also brings back the feeling of high school, not only with high school teammates and opponents, but also with university teammates. It is a special memory, and it is only the World Firefighting Basketball Tournament that allows us to come together and play." - Wu Haoqun, the spiritual leader of the team, can often be heard cheering for the team from the sidelines. He has been heard telling his teammates, "Everyone wants to play here, but if we want to enjoy playing, we must learn to share the ball."

Seeing his competitiveness on the court, one can understand how much he wants to be on the court. However, sharing is also part of the game. Giving up something leads to gaining something. This willingness to share, which is greater than the individual spirit of an athlete, is truly precious. It has contributed to the team's success, not only reaching the finals in the five-on-five competition, but also achieving third place in the three-on-three competition. For them, this summer has been a rewarding one.

Maybe he is not the team's main scorer, but he always provides the necessary firepower when the team needs it. He can be considered the team's best sixth man. - Xu Bingyang, who joined the team for the finals, also cherishes this opportunity. He said, "Of course, being able to participate in the World Firefighting Basketball Tournament, my thoughts are the same as the TGF team's thoughts, upholding the spirit of inheritance and sustainability. Because in a game, there are wins and losses, and victory is secondary. I value the interaction within a team on and off the court. I believe that's where I can truly appreciate how much I have gained from this competition. This year, I am very grateful to the classmates from Guoti University for giving me the opportunity to participate in this event. Everyone has selflessly contributed on the court, and although we just met for the first time, we have developed a strong bond in just these three days. It has allowed me to fully experience the charm of basketball and get to know players from different places. Playing basketball together has made me want to form another team next year and continue to enjoy the game!" - With multiple HBL Division 2 championship players as the core, it is a quite special combination. From being opponents in the past to teammates now, they have gathered because of basketball and made more friends through basketball. This is the most wonderful thing about basketball. However, they not only participate in the competition, but also help organize the courts and surroundings after the games or during rest time. I believe this is where grassroots basketball lies, making basketball more than just a sport.
