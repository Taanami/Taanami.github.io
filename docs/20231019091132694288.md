  Cross-League Invitational Tournament: Nei-Oma's Alma Mater, NCCU, Not on the Same Level

On September 17, 2023, the first game of the Cross-League Invitational Tournament between NCCU and former teammate Yu Aizhe was reported by United Daily News journalist Tseng Szu-ju.

Not only did NCCU win the UBA Men's Division I Championship three years in a row, but they also won the WUBS Championship in Japan this year. Today, they faced off against SBL representatives Taiwan Bank in the first game of the Cross-League Basketball Invitational Tournament. Despite missing their "strongest foreign player" Mobaye, they still managed to defeat Taiwan Bank 87-76. Even new Taiwan Bank player Nei-Oma praised his alma mater, saying that they have made significant improvements. Standing at 205cm, Nei-Oma is from Senegal and his first stop in Taiwan was NCCU. He joined the NCCU Eagles' men's basketball team in their first year in the UBA Men's Division I and helped them win the championship in the 109th academic year. After the season, he entered the 2021 PLG draft and was selected 7th overall by the New Taipei Kings. After two seasons with the Kings, he became a free agent this summer and officially joined Taiwan Bank in early September.

Facing his alma mater in the Cross-League Tournament, Nei-Oma believes that NCCU has improved significantly over the years and is now on a different level compared to when he was in school.

He pointed out that NCCU has a diverse offense, can play inside and outside, and plays as a cohesive team. However, he admitted that he didn't do well in the third quarter when NCCU outscored Taiwan Bank 25-8. He believes that if they can improve their defense, they can still stop their younger teammates. After spending several years in Taiwan, Nei-Oma can now speak some Chinese. He stated that he is currently getting to know his new Taiwan Bank teammates and used Chinese to say "take it slow." He hopes to have a good season in the SBL.

Taiwan Bank head coach Chen Guo-wei is also a member of the coaching staff for the Chinese men's basketball team at the Hangzhou Asian Games. Although he was present at the game today, assistant coach Xu Zhiqiang was in charge of the team. Chen emphasized that their loss today was due to "losing to ourselves." Both their offense and defense did not meet the standards of their usual training. He said, "Especially at the start of the third quarter, we allowed three three-pointers and had too many turnovers on offense. We couldn't play with good ball movement and couldn't bring out our intensity. If we don't do well, this result is not unexpected." NCCU had new foreign player Popoka as their main inside player today. Head coach Chen Zi-wei explained that Mobaye had some family matters and is expected to return on the 19th. This Cross-League Tournament is a great opportunity for the players to encourage each other, showcase their own attitude and style, and learn from the senior players in the professional teams.
