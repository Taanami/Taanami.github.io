  Taipei Fubon Braves, Taiwan Beer Basketball Team, and Lin Ping-cheng failed to reach a consensus. The Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA) stated that they will no longer mediate the dispute.

Regarding the contract dispute between the Taipei Fubon Braves, Taiwan Beer Basketball Team, and Lin Ping-cheng, the CTBA held the first mediation meeting on September 4th. After internal discussions, both parties were unable to reach a consensus. Therefore, the CTBA respects the wishes of the teams and will no longer assist in further mediation. The CTBA will respect and understand any legal actions taken by the teams in the future.

The CTBA will continue to establish and improve relevant systems in the domestic basketball industry, aiming to create a healthier basketball environment. Starting from January 1st, 2024, the CTBA plans to implement the "Sports Agent System" in the hopes of providing protection and fair transactions for the domestic basketball environment, teams, and players, and to prevent contract disputes from affecting the rights and interests of players and teams.
