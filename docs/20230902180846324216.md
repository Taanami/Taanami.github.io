  Angola's Blood Renewal Plan: Introduction to the National Team at the 2023 Basketball World Cup

In various international tournaments, there are always a few countries that the author can guess their lineup without even looking. These countries have limited talent pool and tend to be conservative in their player selection. One example is Angola, the traditional powerhouse in Africa.

Angola has been a regular participant in the World Cup, but their team has been slow in rejuvenating. Eduardo Mingas, who played for Angola in the 2006 FIBA World Championship, was still representing the national team at the age of 40 in 2019.

In addition to Mingas, the previous World Cup roster also included Olimpio Cipriano, who played in the Olympics in 2004, Carlos Morais who played in the AfroBasket in 2005, and Leonel Paulo who joined the national team in 2007. Most of them were still part of the rotation in the previous World Cup.

Although this phenomenon made the author's research easier, it also raised concerns about Angola. Mingas, the old veteran, was still an important player in the previous World Cup, but in recent years Angola has finally started the rejuvenation process. Angola does have talented players, and the squad they sent to the 2019 World Cup qualifiers was significantly different from the previous editions.

The young players in this generation not only helped Angola achieve an impressive record of 10 wins and 2 losses in the qualifiers but also earned their spots in the World Cup roster.

It may be the author's perception, but this new batch of Angolan players seems to be more talented. Unlike traditional African teams that rely on physicality and explosiveness, Angola's core players, led by Mingas, have a different style. Players like Armendo Costa, Felizardo Ambrossio, and Reggie Moore, who recently became a naturalized citizen, face difficulties even in dunking.

In recent years, the newcomers who made it to Angola's rotation have shown great potential. Bruno Fernando, the first Angolan player to make it to the NBA, and Silvio De Sousa, another promising big man from the same generation, have impressed. The new generation players, Jlson Bango and Deantonio Do, may not have the same level of skills as their predecessors, but they have more talent.

Angola, a country that once seemed to be in decline in African basketball, is now rising again. Please continue reading for their journey to the World Cup. Before the World Cup qualifiers, Angola's form was not promising. They lost to Poland and Slovenia in the Olympic qualifiers (although it was unexpected for them to win).

In the 2021 AfroBasket, they were eliminated in the quarterfinals. Angola used to dominate the AfroBasket tournament, winning six consecutive championships from 1989 to 2009, but this time they only finished fifth.

Nevertheless, Angola is still willing to give coach Josep Claros a chance and time. In the World Cup qualifiers, they sent a relatively unknown but talented roster, aside from a few core players. These new faces from Angola have performed exceptionally well, and with the country's passion for basketball, they have received support from fans both at home and away.

Angolan fans are known for their passion, and they showed their support in the qualifiers. Angola started the first game with a 17-0 lead, but eventually lost by a point to the experienced Ivory Coast team.

They struggled against Ivory Coast in their second encounter as well, losing by only two points. However, apart from Ivory Coast, they easily defeated Central African Republic and Guinea. In the qualifiers, they finished second in their group, advancing to the second round.

In the second round, they faced Uganda, Cape Verde, and Nigeria. Angola's top player, Bruno Fernando, had already faced each of these opponents once. They dominated their opponents without mercy, winning all six games in the second round, and defeating Cape Verde, the team that eliminated them in the AfroBasket quarterfinals.

In the second game, with Walter Tavares back in the lineup, Angola's intense defense caused Cape Verde to commit 27 turnovers with only 8 assists, effectively utilizing their physical advantage. In the end, Angola secured their spot in the World Cup in the fifth window. Please continue reading for an analysis of their playing style.

Due to the rejuvenation process, Angola's playing style has undergone some changes. After the 2014 World Cup, they had Yannick Moriera, the shot-blocking king, as their defensive anchor. However, apart from him, most players lacked strong shot-blocking abilities. This has changed in the current World Cup. Most players in the squad have impressive jumping and shot-blocking abilities. Although some players may struggle with physicality, they will not allow easy scoring in their paint. The "hot pot" defense has become a common sight in Angola's highlight reels. As for the guards, with Armando Costa retiring early, Angola has given opportunities to several young guards to gain experience. Among them, Childae Dundao, who may not have an imposing physique, has stood out. Gerson Domingos and Hermangildo Santos have also had multiple experiences as starting point guards. Dundao and Domingos are both fast, but they may not have the composure of Costa.
