  The Key Internet Technology Behind the Memphis Grizzlies' Home Court Advantage

The Memphis Grizzlies, despite being located in a small market, have repeatedly surprised critics in recent years, causing powerhouse teams to break out in a cold sweat during the playoffs. Their fierce playing style and never-give-up spirit have delighted fans, but little is known about the hidden secrets of the Grizzlies' home court network and communication equipment. The tale of the resilient Grizzlies, born out of the tragedy of Vancouver, Canada, began in 1995.

Compared to the Toronto Raptors, another Canadian team that entered the league around the same time, the Grizzlies were considered the league's punching bag due to their poor performance in the early years. The dismal record and the remote location led the management to relocate the team to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001. In their six seasons in Vancouver, the Grizzlies left with a pitiful record of 101 wins and 359 losses, with a winning percentage of only 22%. 

Continue reading below Moving to Memphis in their first year brought a breath of fresh air to the team. Not only did they move to a warm and pleasant southern city, but they also selected Spanish power forward Pau Gasol with the third overall pick in that year's draft. Gasol, who averaged 17.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 2.7 assists in his rookie season, was undoubtedly the cornerstone of the Grizzlies' hopes.

Gasol indeed lived up to expectations, leading the team to their first playoff appearance in his third season. However, they faced tough opponents such as the Spurs, Suns, and Mavericks, and the inexperienced Grizzlies struggled to secure a single victory, suffering three consecutive first-round sweeps with a record of 0 wins and 12 losses in the playoffs.

Unable to break through to the next level and plagued by Gasol's injuries, the team found themselves in a predicament. In the middle of the 2008 season, they traded Gasol to the Los Angeles Lakers for his younger brother, Marc Gasol, among other players.

When Marc reported to the team before the 2008-2009 season, he was an unknown second-round rookie. No one expected him to team up with young point guard Mike Conley, who was drafted the previous year, and disgruntled forward Zach Randolph, acquired through a trade the following summer, to transform the Grizzlies into a Western Conference powerhouse.

Starting from the 2011 season, when they created the "Grit and Grind" legend by defeating the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs, the Grizzlies became the team that could not be ignored in the Western Conference.

Despite never making it past the Western Conference finals, they became the stumbling block for division champions like the Spurs, Warriors, and Thunder, who often had to go through the Grizzlies to reach the finals. Just like the blue-collar atmosphere of Memphis, the Grizzlies' playing style has always been tough, resilient, and relentless. The iron-willed Grizzlies, with their rough exterior and tender heart, have deepened the connection between the team and the local fans, especially with beloved players like Conley and Randolph. Both players are actively involved in community service, with Conley even receiving the NBA Cares Community Assist Award twice. It's not difficult to imagine the special place the Grizzlies hold in Memphis.

As the only major professional sports team in Memphis, the organization is dedicated to building strong community relationships. They actively participate in local education, youth development, health, and fitness initiatives while also striving to enhance the fan's game-day experience.

Since current owner Robert Pera acquired the team in 2012, his company, Ubiquiti Inc., has provided technological assistance to ensure that fans can enjoy uninterrupted internet access while watching games. From the installation of base stations to surveying and measuring signal coverage, the numerous variables make it challenging. Without careful planning and advanced network equipment, complaints about poor signal reception in crowded arenas are not uncommon. This phenomenon is frequently observed during indoor sports events, concerts, and large music festivals.

The FedEx Forum, the Grizzlies' home court, has also faced these challenges. However, after multiple equipment iterations, Ubiquiti Inc.'s Wi-Fi devices have successfully showcased their excellent technology to the world.

The underlying technology behind this is Ubiquiti Inc.'s UniFi Wireless BaseStation - XG (UWB-XG). Continue reading below.
