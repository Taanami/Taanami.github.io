  Unemployed Players in the NBA Free Agency

If you have been following the NBA, you would know that the popular time for free agent signings is usually in July. However, it is already late August, almost September, and there are still a group of players who have not found a new team. Among them, there are quite a few quality players who can provide valuable contributions. Today, we will discuss the unemployed players in the free agency. Please continue reading.

Christian Wood is currently the biggest name in the free agency market. Surprisingly, he has not been signed by any team yet. It is speculated that his asking price may be too high, resulting in a lack of interest from potential suitors. Wood is the type of player that playoff teams would want, as he averages 16 points and 7 rebounds per game. With a field goal percentage of 50% and a three-point shooting percentage of 37%, he is above average and even considered close to being a top player. However, most playoff teams have limited salary cap space and can only offer minimum contracts. It would be somewhat disrespectful to offer Wood a minimum contract considering his skill level. Unfortunately, the reality is that the teams interested in Wood can only offer him the minimum salary. I believe the reason why Wood is still unemployed is not because no one wants him, but rather the inability to agree on contract terms.

The Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers have been rumored as potential destinations for Wood. Personally, I think both teams would be a good fit for him, but it ultimately depends on whether he is willing to accept a lower salary. I believe in his abilities, and if he is utilized correctly, he can perform at a high level and even reach All-Star caliber. To illustrate, Wood's efficiency as a roll man in pick-and-roll situations surpasses 93% of players in the league. This statistic is better than that of players like Sabonis or Adebayo.

Although Wood may not excel in defense, his offensive prowess is top-notch. Having a scoring threat like him coming off the bench is highly valuable, as he can change the momentum of a game at any moment.

Taking the Lakers as an example, imagine having D'Angelo Russell and Wood leading the second unit. Who in the league could defend against their pick-and-roll plays? Even when LeBron James and Anthony Davis are resting, this combination of an inside and outside threat could outperform many starting lineups. Wood's abilities are strong, and his strengths and weaknesses are apparent. He is a player who can make a significant impact. If I were part of his management team, I would advise him to quickly sign a one-year contract with the Lakers, showcase his skills under the spotlight, and then pursue a larger contract. Just like how Dewayne Dedmon successfully rejuvenated his career and went to Toronto happily, there's no need to linger here. Sign a one-year contract, perform well in a big city, and the money will follow.

Kelly Oubre Jr.'s situation is similar to Wood's. He is also currently unemployed because good teams are interested but are offering less money, while teams with money are not interested in signing Oubre.

Although Oubre's offensive efficiency may not be as good as Wood's, he is still a capable scorer, especially as a bench player. Last season with the Charlotte Hornets, he averaged nearly 20 points per game due to having the freedom to score. However, his shooting percentages are not impressive, with only a 31% three-point shooting percentage and a 43% overall shooting percentage. It would be a stretch to consider him a quality starter based on these efficiency numbers.

You might think, "Isn't Oubre a 3-and-D wing? Why hasn't he found a team yet?" Regarding the defensive aspect, his 6'7" height and excellent athleticism make him a decent defender. However, when it comes to his three-point shooting, I can confidently say that Oubre's accuracy is not great. You might be surprised, but throughout his career, he has never surpassed a 38% three-point shooting percentage, with only one season reaching a 35% mark. If this level of accuracy qualifies as a 3-and-D player, then the standard for such a designation is quite lenient.

If I were to evaluate Oubre, I would say that his best role is as a scoring wing off the bench. He has the ability to score in large quantities. If the game's pace is fast and there are many transition opportunities, he can easily contribute 20 points. However, should he be a starter for an entire season? Perhaps only a team like the Hornets from last season, who were in rebuilding mode, would be able to do that. Currently, there are rumors of interest from the Cleveland Cavaliers, Dallas Mavericks, and Miami Heat. Out of these teams, Cleveland seems like the best fit for him as they have limited wing depth, with players like Strus, LeVert, and Okoro who do not possess the same physical attributes as Oubre. If he joins the Cavaliers, he would undoubtedly receive playing time, as they lack scoring options off the bench. However, it is interesting to note that the three teams rumored to be interested in Oubre, namely the Mavericks, Heat, and Cavaliers, are also the slowest-paced teams in the league. Do you remember what I said earlier? Oubre excels in fast-paced games. His two best seasons were in 2020 with the Phoenix Suns and this year with the Hornets, both coinciding with these teams ranking 9th in pace. Given this background, it remains uncertain whether Oubre can fit in with his new team. However, at the moment, he does not have many options. He should quickly find a team in need of a wing player, just like Wood. Forget about the salary for now and focus on getting playing time.
