 The 2023 FIBA World Cup for Men's Basketball will kick off on August 25 after various qualifying stages. This edition marks the 19th World Cup and the third since the tournament was rebranded from the former FIBA World Championship. Despite facing challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic and various qualifying formats in different continents, the tournament has maintained its four-year cycle and will now be held one year before the Olympics, as planned, in 2023.

The host countries for this edition are Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines. The group stage matches for Groups A, B, C, and D, as well as the two additional groups for the second round, will be played in Manila, Philippines. Group stage matches for Groups E and F will be held in Okinawa, Japan, while Groups G and H will play their matches in Jakarta, Indonesia. Okinawa and Jakarta will also each host one group for the second round matches. The tournament will run from August 25 to September 10, with the semifinals and finals taking place on September 10.

The 32 teams are divided into eight groups for the preliminary round. The top two teams from each group (16 teams in total) will then be combined into four groups for the second round, with their preliminary round results carrying over. The top two teams from each second round group will advance to the quarterfinals, while the bottom two teams from each group will be ranked 9th to 16th. The remaining 16 teams that did not advance to the second round will be grouped together and ranked 17th to 32nd.
