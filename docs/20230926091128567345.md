# The effectiveness of rushing the US men's basketball team to the World Cup remains a concern 
 The effectiveness of rushing the US men's basketball team to the World Cup remains a concern. The team won their first game against New Zealand 99-72 in the 2023 FIBA World Cup and continued to secure victories in subsequent matches.

It is widely known that this team is filled with promising young talents but lacks veteran players. Only three players from the roster, Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton, and Jaren Jackson Jr., were selected for last year's All-Star game.

Furthermore, while Jaren Jackson Jr. won the Defensive Player of the Year award and Paolo Banchero won the Rookie of the Year award, none of them made it to the NBA All-League Team. The crucial reason why star players are important for the US team is that these young players have not experienced many big moments.

Among the entire team, only Bobby Portis, Mikal Bridges, and Cameron Johnson have been to the NBA Finals. This lack of experience raises questions about whether these players can step up in important moments. Please continue reading.

Additionally, none of the players on the US team roster have been selected for the NBA All-League Team. This makes it intriguing to think about how the performance of the US team will develop.

The US team has seven players who averaged at least 32 minutes of playing time per game in the 2022-23 season, giving them a significant depth advantage compared to other teams. However, they lack the superstar players who can lead the team.

According to the statistical data from the SCHOENE projection system and NBAshotcharts.com adjustments, the US team has a chance to win over 52 games in the NBA. Only four teams achieved such a record last season.

Although these statistics are conservative in nature, based on the current roster and projected playing time, only the Boston Celtics (54.6) are expected to have more average wins than the US team. With such strong depth, the US team also has the best offensive forecast, scoring over 4 points per 100 possessions above the league average. The Celtics, under the same conditions, have only +3.6.

Despite having the Defensive Player of the Year in Jaren Jackson Jr., the US team's defense is only slightly above average due to a lack of other interior players.

So far, Kerr has used Banchero as the primary backup for Jaren Jackson Jr., focusing on mobility and defensive versatility. These aspects are not as crucial in the NBA regular season, so adjusting the playing time of Banchero and Kessler will be one of the strategies to improve the US team's defense.

Comparing to the performance in the 2019 World Cup, where the US team finished seventh, it was the worst performance ever for the team in a major tournament.

Interestingly, the 2019 team had higher ratings when entering the tournament, with an average projected win count of 56.4, surpassing any team in the 2019-20 NBA season.

Looking back, the concerns about the lack of star players on the US team that year seem laughable. Three players from that roster, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Donovan Mitchell, were selected for the NBA All-League Team in the 2022-23 season, with Tatum and Mitchell ranking fourth and sixth in the MVP voting.

Of course, these players had not become superstars at that time. But perhaps in the future, we may look back on this year's young core players in a similar way. Please continue reading.

One of the reasons for the underperformance of the US team in 2019 was Tatum's ankle injury during the early stages of the group stage, and Marcus Smart's absence from two games due to hand soreness, which greatly affected the team's perimeter depth.

Most importantly, the 2019 US team had not found the chemistry needed to effectively suppress opponents. If Kerr and the coaching staff can find a reasonable rotation lineup and execute it well, it should pay off during the World Cup. However, compared to other countries with long-term training programs, the US team often rushes to assemble their team for such tournaments, which raises concerns for this year's World Cup.
