  112HBL Roster Structure Changes: Cureping High School focuses on teamwork to take steady steps forward

For Cureping High School, the ending of the 111th HBL season was undoubtedly shocking. After fighting their way through the chaotic qualification rounds, they emerged from the "Group of Death" consisting of Preseason, Nengren Commercial High School, Songshan High School, and Keelung Business and Vocational School. They even defeated the championship favorites, Songshan High School, and staged a comeback against Keelung Business and Vocational School after falling behind in a significant margin to secure their spot in the playoffs.

In the first life-or-death match of the wildcard game in the playoffs, Cureping High School and Chenggong High School fought fiercely until the end of the fourth quarter. A five-second violation during a serve caused Cureping to lose their last chance to score, leading the game to go into overtime. However, in a situation where Cureping was trailing by three points at the final moment, they committed another serve violation, allowing the opponent to score two points and resulting in their defeat.

The Cureping roster for the 111th season consisted of many talented players. The senior trio, Dai Yi, Yang Haoxiang, and Hong Huaien, formed a top-notch backcourt lineup. Lu Qinghong and Huang Yanlun were reliable forwards with solid playing styles. Second-year players Zheng Xufu, Huang Shengen, and Chen Guanlun also made timely contributions. Cureping also welcomed former Xinrong High School coach Su Yusheng to the coaching staff last year, bringing a qualitative change to the team's defense. Together with coach Wu Jianlong, who inherited the Nengren system's offensive system, they established a team style that excelled in both offense and defense. Please continue reading.

Overall, Cureping had a relatively well-rounded main lineup last year, despite being slightly lacking in height. Coach Su Yusheng admitted that the heartbreaking ending last year was not the players' fault. "The problem last year was still with the coaching staff! We didn't explain clearly during the timeout. We have to take the greatest responsibility."

After the end of the 111th season, Cureping bid farewell to five key players, including two main attackers, Dai Yi and Yang Haoxiang, leaving a significant void in the team's offense. Both Wu Jianlong and Su Yusheng believe that this year, with a lack of players who can take charge of the attack, Cureping must strive towards the goal of "everyone is a soldier."

Wu Jianlong said, "I emphasized to them this year that even though we had excellent attackers like Haoxiang and Dai Yi last year, we still couldn't make it to the top eight. It just shows that basketball still relies on all five players. Even if I don't score, as long as I can defend the opponent and contribute to the team, it will bring positive energy to the team."

Su Yusheng believes that the team's defensive intensity will be the key to how far Cureping, with a height of only 190cm, can go this year. They must put more pressure on opponents and create more exhaustion from the frontcourt to have a chance to compete with the strong teams.

Since the summer tournaments, Cureping has continued to demonstrate impressive competitiveness. However, the coaching staff has noticed that the team occasionally experiences power outages. For Cureping, who is about to participate in the qualification rounds, improving stability will be an important task to adjust before the start of the HBL season. Coach Su Yusheng admits that, after all, this is a student basketball game, and fluctuations are sometimes unavoidable. However, if such uncontrollable turbulence occurs during critical moments, it will severely impact the overall condition of the team. Wu Jianlong also said, "Our stability is really not enough now. After all, we are a team that will participate in the qualification rounds, and our condition cannot be fluctuating." "Sometimes when our team cooperates well, we can win by 20 points, but if we suddenly rely on individuals, that rhythm disappears. We don't have any outstanding individuals this year, so we can only rely on the team. Therefore, we must establish a sense of teamwork, and several players must step up for a chance to compete with strong teams." Despite having competitive strength every year, Cureping always falls short at critical moments. Wu Jianlong jokingly said that this year, they won't be thinking about "reaching the top eight" like last year but instead focus on taking each step steadily and firmly. Perhaps this approach can reduce the players' pressure and even bring unexpected surprises. "After all, the process and determination are the most important, rather than whether we make it to the top eight or not." Follow the Sports Vision for more in-depth sports reports.
