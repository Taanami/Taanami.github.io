The road back to Los Angeles will not be easy for Harden, and the trade deadlock puts both parties in a difficult position. As I mentioned in my previous discussion about Harden's future with the 76ers, both sides do not have much disagreement about his desire to leave.

Harden doesn't need to use technical absences from team activities to pressure Morey, and it's also not Morey's wish to keep him. A breakup is inevitable. However, even if the 76ers' front office wants to be the bigger person and trade Harden, the 34-year-old may find himself in a difficult situation. By choosing to absent himself from media day and the first day of training camp, Harden is making a statement that is unnecessary.

[Can the Beard blow away?] Where will he go? How about Hawaii! But Morey is also unlikely to sell Harden at a cheap price. From the perspective of the 76ers' front office, their star player Joel Embiid still has four years left on his contract, while both Harden and Tobias Harris only have one year left. The Bucks and Celtics, the main competitors in the Eastern Conference, have strengthened their roster, and the Heat still has Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo leading the team. Even the Greek Freak is still with the team.

Philadelphia's strategy of waiting for the right opportunity may not work. If they want to keep Embiid and maintain their chances of winning the championship, they must get corresponding assets in return for Harden.

Rumors say that the trade is stuck because Morey is asking for too much, but that's not fair. Let's look at it from the perspective of the 76ers' front office. Their newly crowned Most Valuable Player "Pencil Brother" Joel Embiid still has four years left on his contract, while their two main players, Harden and Tobias Harris, only have one year left. The Bucks and Celtics, the main competitors in the Eastern Conference, have strengthened their roster, and the Heat still has Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo leading the team, while Giannis Antetokounmpo is still with the team.

Philadelphia wants to take a wait-and-see approach, but it's probably not the best option. They must get corresponding assets in return for Harden, which is fundamentally different from how they handled the situation with Ben Simmons last year.

Luckily, they handled the "Simmons blowing incident" well and eventually landed Harden. [Can the Beard blow away?] Where will he go? How about Hawaii! The situation with Harden is different.

He wants to play for his hometown Los Angeles, and the only team that "might" be willing to help him fulfill his dream is the Clippers, but their "willingness" may not be very high. After all, it's Harden who wants to go, not the Clippers who must have him.

The Clippers' problem is that they don't have many players (or potential assets) that they can trade, unless the 76ers are just looking to save money or get draft picks (they still have the Clippers' first-round picks from 2027 to 2030). Without giving up either Kawhi Leonard or Paul George, the Clippers may have to offer Robert Covington, who will turn 33 by the end of the year and underwent ACL surgery on his right knee in late August. He only played 12 minutes in 5 playoff games and, despite being in a contract year, the 76ers may not benefit much from getting him back. Even if they include a former Raptor and member of the 2019 championship team Norman Powell, it doesn't seem like a very enticing package.

The other assets with trading value include the young guard Bones Hyland, the center Ivica Zubac, or the wing Terance Mann that they acquired from the Nuggets. All of them are usable, but I'm not sure if Embiid will be satisfied. If the 76ers can accept Covington+Powell+Mann/Zubac, plus a first-round pick and a bench player to balance salaries, the Clippers' bench depth will certainly be affected, and it depends on whether they are willing to take that risk. If they really want to bet, it's uncertain if Covington would be the main course, and a third or fourth team may have to be involved in the trade. The more options on the table, the more attractive the deal may be, increasing the chances that Morey will pull the trigger. If they keep serving the same dish, they may end up getting rejected. Of course, it may be better if they don't trade at all. After all, the Clippers' main enemy is staying healthy, and the NBA's new resting rules... (?)[Can the Beard blow away?] Where will he go?
