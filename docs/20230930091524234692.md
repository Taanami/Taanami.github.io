DeMar DeRozan is undoubtedly an excellent mid-range scorer and dunker, but his three-point shooting is not exceptional. However, it seems that he is not interested in changing to adapt to the trend. DeRozan recently gave an interview, where some opinions suggested that DeRozan should shoot more three-pointers. In response, DeRozan said, "I don't need to make any changes. In NBA history, only 38 players have scored more than me."

He continued, "I'm not saying that I don't need to shoot three-pointers. However, I'm also not saying that I have to shoot 10 three-pointers every night. I don't have that mindset. I will still stay in my comfort zone and do what I do well. When there's an opportunity for a three-pointer, I will take it. I'm not saying that I won't shoot."

Throughout his career, DeRozan has averaged 21.0 points per game (with a shooting percentage of 46.8%). He is currently in the best form of his career while playing for the Chicago Bulls.
