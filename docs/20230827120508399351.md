On the last day of the Jones Cup, in the penultimate game, Chinese White Team faced Iran. The last time Chinese White Team won a game was last Sunday, so their goal today was to end the tournament with a win and leave a good impression. Chinese White Team started the game with the same momentum they had against the South Korean team yesterday, performing better both offensively and defensively than in previous games. They took a 12-6 lead, with Ma Jianhao, Chen Fanbayan, and Hong Kaijie making shots from the outside. The first quarter ended with Chinese White Team leading 25-15. In the second quarter, the White Team continued to maintain their lead with two fast break layups and a three-pointer from Hong Kaijie. Iran's offense woke up in this quarter, with multiple shots from beyond the arc. As a result, the White Team called two timeouts and temporarily led by 8 points at halftime.

In the second half, the He brothers continued to contribute points for the White Team, but Iran still put significant pressure on them. Iran showed great patience in handling each possession.

With just over 3 minutes left, Ma Jianhao made a fast break dunk, igniting the emotions of the fans in the arena. However, Iran managed to close the gap in this quarter, entering the final quarter with a 3-point difference.

At the start of the final quarter, He Dan immediately hit two consecutive three-pointers, and He Bo's fast break dunk broke the stalemate. Shortly after, Ma Jianhao made another three-pointer, extending the White Team's lead to 6 points with 2 minutes remaining.

In a crucial moment with 1 minute and 29 seconds left, Ma Jianhao made a fadeaway jumper, and Bai Yecheng cut in from the left side to score, eluding the defender. However, when the difference was 8 points, Iran scored three consecutive three-pointers and drew fouls on drives to narrow the gap to 2 points. Then, a turnover occurred during a backcourt inbound pass. Fortunately, after Iran's timeout, the White Team successfully defended against Iran's offense. Chen Fanbayan calmly made both free throws after being fouled, and Iran once again failed to make a shot. The game ended with a 91-86 victory for the White Team over Iran, finally breaking their five-game losing streak. In this tournament, Chinese White Team achieved 3 wins and 5 losses. He Bo scored the highest with 18 points, while He Dan and Ma Jianhao both scored 14 points, Chen Fanbayan scored 13 points, and Ban Ba contributed 10 points.
