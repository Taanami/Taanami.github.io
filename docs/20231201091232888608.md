After some changes and adjustments, the third season of T1 League will officially kick off with five teams on October 28 (Saturday) at the Xinzhuan Gymnasium. The defending champions, New Taipei Citibank Attackers, will face off against Tainan Taiwan Steel Eagles in the season opener, a rematch of last season's championship game. From the original six teams, the Taiwan Beer Yulon Luxgen and Taoyuan Yulon Leopards have merged to become Taiwan Beer Yongfeng Leopards, while the entry rights of Taiwan Beer have been transferred to the new team, Taipei Taiwan Shin Warriors.
