  在這個休賽期，Morant改變了訓練方式，增加體能訓練，並且有更多的溝通，讓他和隊友之間建立了更好的關係。他也表示在過去幾個月中，他一直在學習如何成為更好的領袖，並且希望能夠在球場上展現出更成熟的表現。Morant的禁賽期間已經過去一段時間了，他現在有機會和球隊一起練球，也希望能夠在第26場比賽中回歸場上，讓球迷們看到他的表現。 

 During the suspension of Memphis Grizzlies' GM Ja Morant, he is allowed to practice with the team and travel with them to away games, according to Grizzlies' General Manager Zach Kleiman. The team held its media day today and Kleiman also gave an interview, where he talked about Morant's suspension and the team's plans for him.

Kleiman said, "I think it's a good thing for Ja and for our team. He can be with us every day."

The NBA has stated that as long as Morant stays on track, he will be allowed to participate in all team activities that are not open to the public, including practices, shooting drills, and traveling with the team. Of course, we know that he won't be able to be with us during the preseason and the first 25 regular season games, but we will see him again in the 26th game and we can't wait for his return." Kleiman also mentioned that Morant has been working hard and taking steps in the right and healthy direction. When asked if the team has taken any measures to help Morant stay out of trouble, Kleiman did not comment and said those discussions are kept within the team.

Head Coach Taylor Jenkins was also asked about Morant's absence at the start of the season. Jenkins said that Morant will not be training with the starting lineup during training camp because he won't be with the team at the start of the season.

Jenkins also stated that during training camp, they want to push Morant to be the best version of himself. He said, "We have designed a different training program for him and we constantly push him. He is very excited for us to challenge him more. Recently, I have been talking to Morant about how he can become the best version of himself."

Teammate Desmond Bane also shared his thoughts on Morant, saying, "He has been with us for the past few weeks and he is very focused and committed on the court. He is still being himself and I see a lot of positive energy from him, which is the most important thing." Morant had a disappointing season last year, being suspended for 8 games and then being eliminated by the Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. During the offseason, he was suspended for 25 games for violating the league's rules.

During the offseason, Morant changed his training methods and focused more on physical training. He also improved his communication with his teammates, building better relationships. He also mentioned that he has been learning how to be a better leader and hopes to show a more mature performance on the court. It has been some time since Morant's suspension and now he has the opportunity to practice with the team and hopes to make his return in the 26th game and show fans his performance.
