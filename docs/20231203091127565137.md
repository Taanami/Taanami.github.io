 In the first quarter of the NBA game, LeBron James was poked in the eye and returned to the court to continue fighting. During the Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns preseason game, the Lakers were temporarily leading 58-54 at halftime. However, with 1:12 left in the first quarter, an unexpected incident occurred on the court. Phoenix Suns defender Jordan Goodwin accidentally poked LeBron James in the eye while defending him.

Of course, the referee called a foul on the play, but LeBron James seemed to be okay and immediately returned to the court to make two free throws. He did not leave the court and even made a three-pointer with 26 seconds left in the first quarter.

As the Lakers and Suns game continued, the Lakers maintained a four-point lead. Kevin Durant of the Suns played in this game, but the other two superstars, Bradley Beal and Devin Booker, scored 21 points in the first half. LeBron James was not affected by the eye poke and scored 19 points in the first half, while Anthony Davis had 13 points and Austin Reaves had 11 points. The Lakers' scoring was concentrated on these three players.
