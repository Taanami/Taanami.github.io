  The Unforeseen Two Years of Bai Yaocheng's Journey

How many years does it take for one's life to completely turn around? For Bai Yaocheng, the past two years of his career have progressed at an astonishing pace. It all started with the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to his debut in the national team and representing Taiwan in the World Cup qualifiers. He then went through intense competition in the P. LEAGUE+ and T1 League drafts, stepping onto the professional court. After completing his rookie season in the P. LEAGUE+, he was crowned the Rookie of the Year. Following that, he had another opportunity to wear the national team jersey as a member of the Chinese White Team in this year's Jones Cup.

"Never did I imagine that one day I would be a part of the Chinese national team, not even from my days in Yu-Shou University," Bai Yaocheng said. Bai Yaocheng's basketball journey is interesting, or rather, the fact that we can discuss his "basketball journey" is already surprising. He wasn't initially seen as a talented player. He was just an active kid who played basketball during his free time. In fourth grade, his coach noticed his potential and took him to training. After graduating from elementary school, Bai Yaocheng entered Taichung Fengyang Junior High School, where he became classmates with the "Fengyang Three Musketeers," who had previously competed in the HBL (High School Basketball League). He continued his basketball training from elementary school but suffered a torn meniscus in his knee during practice. Due to the injury and his original lack of interest in basketball, he transferred to Yu-Ying Junior High School, which was closer to home. Bai Yaocheng thought that his basketball journey was over at that point. However, things took a different turn. Despite the injury and his lack of interest, Bai Yaocheng joined the basketball team at Tungshan High School, which seemed like a good compromise for him. Although the Tungshan High School basketball team was not considered a top-tier team and the training was not too rigorous, everything changed when Liao Yinzhong, who was originally coaching the established HBL team from Nanhu High School, became the new coach at Tungshan High School. This greatly altered the plans for Tungshan and Bai Yaocheng. Tungshan specifically brought in Liao Yinzhong, who had years of coaching experience in the HBL, and Liao immediately set the goal for the team to challenge the top-tier HBL division. Bai Yaocheng resisted initially but eventually accepted Liao Yinzhong's arrangement. The subsequent journey was completely different from what Bai Yaocheng had expected. Despite his initial lack of expectations, Bai Yaocheng led Tungshan High School to success in the HBL, reaching the top eight. Then, with Liao Yinzhong's recommendation, he joined the famous basketball program at National Kaohsiung Normal University, where under the guidance of coach Xie Yujuan, Bai Yaocheng gradually grew into the team's playmaker. He also became a member of the "Tungshan Gang," a group of players from Tungshan High School. As the Tungshan Gang became increasingly vital for National Kaohsiung Normal University, Bai Yaocheng and his teammates replaced the previous main sources of players from Sanmin Commercial High School. The three main players from Tungshan High School, Bai Yaocheng, Qiu Zixuan, and Liu Chengyan, not only led National Kaohsiung Normal University to success but also joined the professional league, continuing the legacy of the "Tungshan Spirit" in the basketball community.

This basketball journey truly changed Bai Yaocheng's life. However, he is not someone who has always had great confidence in himself, whether it be the gap in ambition from the beginning or the intensity he felt on the court. It is not that he lacked talent. It is just that his coaches, from Liao Yinzhong in high school to Xie Yujuan in university, and now Coach Xu Haocheng of the Chinese White Team, all remind him of his offensive abilities and encourage him to be more proactive on the court, not just a pass-first point guard. For Bai Yaocheng, the affirmation from coaches at different levels makes him feel truly trusted and motivated.

"During each transition, I always worry if I can continue to improve and move up. Even after joining National Kaohsiung Normal University, I thought I could only play until the end of college. So, the affirmation from each coach at different stages is crucial to me," Bai Yaocheng said.

In the Jones Cup, apart from being rested for the game against the United States, Bai Yaocheng started in three out of four games and played over 20 minutes in each game. He clearly plays a vital role as a key substitute in the backcourt for the coaching staff. After coming off the bench in the recent game on August 17th, Bai Yaocheng showcased his speed multiple times, including two impressive drives to the basket. He earned praise from the coaching staff. Despite the Chinese White Team's loss to Qatar with a final score of 59-71, Bai Yaocheng, as a game-changing weapon off the bench, scored the team's highest 11 points, once again earning the trust of the coaching staff. Within two years, he not only stepped onto the professional stage but also played in international games, wearing the "Chinese" jersey. Bai Yaocheng describes himself as "leveling up and defeating monsters." These opponents were something he never thought about before. But the fact that the coaches believed in him, as if he successfully cleared a level, gives him an incredible feeling.

In terms of talent, Bai Yaocheng may not be the most anticipated player. However, the skills he has accumulated along the way have been enough to receive this affirmation and opportunities to enter the professional league and even represent the national team. Describing it as "incredible" may not sound like a self-assessment that a player capable of making the national team would give themselves, but Bai Yaocheng has indeed embarked on a journey that he never expected. For all those who have considered giving up or had no interest but still returned to the path of basketball, perhaps this experience can serve as a reference.

However, we already know that Bai Yaocheng, who continues to absorb growth and truly walks the path of basketball, has many challenges waiting for him in the future.
