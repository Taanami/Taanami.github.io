  2023 FIBA World Cup Men's Basketball New Taipei City Warm-up Game: Lithuania vs Latvia, World No. 8 Dominates

In the third game of the FIBA World Cup basketball New Taipei City warm-up, Lithuania, ranked No. 8 in the world, faced off against another European team, Latvia, ranked No. 29. Both teams are from the Baltic region.

Unfortunately, this is a short-term tournament, so it is difficult to objectively compare whether it is Puerto Rico's back-to-back games that are too tiring, a clash of European playing styles, or Lithuania's superior performance. In any case, Latvia, which won by a slim margin against Puerto Rico in the previous game (13 points for Lithuania vs 12 points for Latvia), suffered a heavy defeat, trailing by 35 points at halftime and losing by 24 points in the end. * Analyzing the performance of the teams and the quality of the players, it is evident that Latvia is not on the same level as Lithuania. However, in the author's opinion, the difference between the two teams is not as significant as it appears on paper. The cumulative effects of several key factors led to Latvia's major loss in this game. Please continue reading.

1. The difference in bench strength: From the start of the game, it was apparent that Lithuania was more focused and intense compared to their game against Puerto Rico. They aggressively utilized their two main players, Valanciunas and Jokubaitis, in a 2-Men Game pick-and-roll offense, displaying greater aggression and efficiency than in the previous game. Despite this, Latvia, led by the 7'2" center Pasecniks, managed to keep up with Lithuania's aggressive offense, leading to a 12-12 tie. * In this game, Valanciunas played aggressively from the first quarter and even added pressure with strong attacks in the fourth quarter. He showcased his NBA-level skills, even using Harden-style drawing fouls, and celebrated his success with a smile. However, once both teams made substitutions, the difference became apparent. Perhaps if they played again, Latvia would not substitute their starting lineup so thoroughly. Without an effective pick-and-roll offense in the paint, Latvia resorted to testing their luck from the outside against Lithuania's solid defense. On the other hand, Lithuania still had NBA-level backup center Motiejunas and Canadian naturalized player number 9, Brazdeikis, who played with an American playing style. They continued the ball-handling offense initiated by Jokubaitis, resulting in a widening gap. This ultimately led to a devastating 18-0 run by Lithuania in the second half of the first quarter, turning the score from 12-12 to 12-30, effectively sealing the game.

2. Defense, defense, defense! Although many fans praise Lithuania's smooth team tactics, selflessness, and emphasis on spacing on the offensive end, their advantage compared to Latvia is limited. Their main strength lies in the individual skills of their players. When Latvia increased their defensive intensity in the second half, applying more aggressive pressure, Lithuania's smooth offensive flow was disrupted, and they had to rely on individual abilities.

What truly impressed spectators at the venue was the defense, possibly the highest intensity ever witnessed in a basketball game in Taiwan (whether it be an NBA team or Barcelona in the Spanish League).

From man-to-man defense at the start of the game to suffocating zone defense later on, Lithuania's defensive rotations, help defense, whether it be screens or defensive positioning, were incredibly swift. The team's aggressiveness and cohesion were commendable, even inspiring the author. Please continue reading.

In this game, Lithuania demonstrated remarkable selflessness and unity. Even their two main centers, Valanciunas and Motiejunas, were seen frequently switching or chasing their opponents beyond the three-point line. Without everyone's relentless effort, regardless of their position or status, such tight team defense would not have been possible.

It was precisely because of Lithuania's strong defense that they were able to easily extend their lead through defensive counterattacks from the second half of the first quarter to the second quarter. By the time Latvia also increased their defensive intensity in the second half, the point difference was already insurmountable. It was even more surprising that despite most of the second half being garbage time, Lithuania, once again, launched a full-court intense man-to-man defense in the supposed fatigued fourth quarter. Such physical and mental dedication is truly exceptional!

3. Disparity in the ability to capitalize on opportunities: Lithuania's strong defense prevented Latvia from scoring opportunities unless it was through the presence of their tall players in the paint or occasional short passes to exploit gaps in the defense. Outside shooting opportunities were often fleeting, and when they did manage to find open space, their shooting accuracy was poor. Lithuania continued to focus on defense, not allowing easy shots from the outside. Latvia's three-point shooting percentage was only 21.4% (6/28). Even when they made cuts to the basket after receiving the ball, they often lacked execution power, resulting in frequent counterattacks.

On the other hand, Lithuania, despite facing a slightly weaker defense from Latvia, had players who were just as effective at catching the ball after pick-and-rolls. Whether it was the accuracy of shooters positioned in the corners or the 45-degree angle (30% three-point shooting percentage throughout the game) or the individual ability to finish at the basket after receiving the ball (competitive one-on-one skills), Lithuania excelled.
