Dream Team's first day report: A day of evenly matched games.

The first game saw the Fubon Braves being defeated by the Family Mart Sea Gods with a score of 104:98. This game was full of highlights, starting with the rotation of both teams' foreign players.

The Sea Gods had Brookman, Jones, Allen, and Kusas, while the Fubon Braves had Bellfield, Sintil, Johnson, and Shimen.

The foreign player configurations of both teams were quite similar, with a ball-handling guard, a scoring foreign player, and two tall players above 210cm. Please continue reading below. In the opening of the game, the Sea Gods fielded Brookman and Kusas, while the Fubon Braves had Johnson and Shimen. In the first half, we could see that the Sea Gods' three-pointers were not accurate, while the Fubon Braves targeted the Sea Gods' weakness - the lack of height at the power forward position - and used it to their advantage.

Whenever Brookman was on the court, the Fubon Braves would send a center and a scoring foreign player to play against him. Whether it was Sintil or Johnson, they continuously used mismatches to attack the Sea Gods' defense. The Braves also assigned Zhou Guiyu to defend against Brookman, causing the Sea Gods' offense to struggle in the first half. However, the Sea Gods reacted quickly and towards the end of the second quarter, the coaching staff put in two foreign players at the same time - Allen and Kusas - which had a great effect.

In the second half, the Sea Gods' three-pointers started to improve, with Wu Xiaojin's three-point shot piercing through the Braves' defense. Combined with the Braves' three-pointers becoming less accurate, the Sea Gods gradually closed the gap and even took the lead in the third quarter, leading to a back-and-forth battle until the end of the game. In the final minutes, the Sea Gods relied on Brookman's consecutive mid-range shots and a three-pointer from Lu Weiting, who had been specifically called out by Coach Ma Yihong, to seal the victory with a six-point lead.

In fact, the key point of this game was the decisions made by both coaching staffs. With similar foreign player configurations, the Braves' tactic was to use mismatches and not field foreign players in the same position, instead using local players to limit Brookman, while letting Johnson and Sintil score heavily.

On the other hand, the Sea Gods had two tactics. The first was to go head-to-head against the Braves. For example, if the Braves fielded Johnson and Shimen, the Sea Gods would use Allen and Kusas, with Jones playing against Sintil and Brookman defending against Bellfield.

But using this tactic resulted in a stalemate, with neither team able to gain an advantage. So the Sea Gods chose the second tactic, which was to target Sintil. Whenever the Braves fielded Sintil, the Sea Gods would put in two tall foreign players, using Qiu Zixuan to defend against Sintil. Please continue reading below. In this situation, it's like whoever's head breaks first will determine the outcome - whether it's the Braves' power forward or the Sea Gods' small forward. In the end, it was a close call, with neither team able to fully contain the other, but the Sea Gods ultimately secured the victory, thanks to their improved performance in the second half.

The second game saw the Dream Team defeat the CTBC Brothers with a score of 107:101. As for the Brothers, they were missing Lin Wei-han, Abbasi, and Zeng Wendong in their starting lineup, and their foreign player Ed was not registered. Xie Yaxuan also didn't have much playing time, causing their overall offense to be dismal and their team coordination to be non-existent. Their once-praised passing game was also lacking. The first half was relatively normal, but in the second half, their entire team seemed to malfunction, not knowing what they were playing for.

On the other hand, the Dream Team played with great organization and precision. They attacked inside when necessary and were not hesitant to take outside shots, with their three-pointers being especially accurate. Lin Junji, despite being defended by the Brothers, still managed to constantly break through and tear apart their defense, scoring 25 points and leading the Dream Team to victory.

The Dream Team's foreign player rotation was interesting, with two players being paired together - Gilbert and Bezani, Blue and McCulloch - providing both height and scoring power, and performing exceptionally well.

In addition, local forward Xin Woke put on a stellar performance, being able to shoot from the outside and score inside, completely suppressing the Brothers' small forwards. From today's game, we can see that it's a good thing for the two leagues to have exchanges, as it allows for different playing styles and helps improve our own game. Let's look forward to the second day of games together.
