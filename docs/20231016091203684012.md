 The NBA has been implementing jersey advertising policies in the league for quite some time, which can bring significant additional income to teams. Today, the Charlotte Hornets announced a collaboration with American internet sensation MrBeast's snack company, Feastables. The team's jerseys for the upcoming season will feature advertisements from Feastables, making this the first partnership between an NBA team and a brand led by an influencer/creator. MrBeast himself is also from North Carolina and is a big fan of basketball. He expressed his excitement to collaborate with his hometown team and to promote his brand to audiences all over the United States and the world. Feastables was founded by MrBeast in January 2022, offering a variety of chocolate flavors for consumers to choose from. In May of this year, MrBeast made headlines by giving away $10,000 to a random creator who retweeted his post. He also engages with his audience on YouTube and Instagram through high-cost production videos. His YouTube channel has a whopping 188 million subscribers.
