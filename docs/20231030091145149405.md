  A Look Back at the 2023 World Cup Thunder 5 

Representing Canada, Australia, and Latvia, the five Thunder players at this year's basketball World Cup have all performed quite well. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has shown that he can adapt to both American and international rules, and has become a "big brother" on both the Thunder and Canadian teams; Dort has proven himself to be a key player for both teams...and also a funny guy (laughs); Giddey has shown great potential, but also has areas where he needs to improve; White is trying to earn a spot on both his professional and national teams, and also has areas where he needs to work harder; and Bertans has changed my opinion of him the most.

Here is a recap of the 5 Thunder players at the World Cup, based on my favorite series "5 takeaways" from the Thunder Blue fan page. Let's continue reading about Jack White's *first time being selected for the senior national team.

Due to Jock Landale's injury, White had the opportunity to make the 12-man roster. Australian team head coach Brian Goorjian believed that White, who had been training with the team, was a player he was familiar with and could contribute in certain formations, so he included him in the rotation. *White did play in all 5 games, but he was not a key rotation player, averaging only 7.6 minutes per game with 2.2 points and 1.6 rebounds. Although he didn't have a lot of playing time, it was still a good start for him.

*In the first game against Finland, White had his best performance at the World Cup: playing a season-high 15 minutes, shooting 2 for 3 from 2-point range, 1 for 1 from 3-point range, and scoring 7 points with 2 rebounds and 1 assist. *In the third game against Japan, which was crucial for advancing to the quarterfinals, he only played for 1 minute; and in the second game against Slovenia, which was crucial for advancing to the knockout stage, he played for only 2 minutes. It's clear that he hasn't gained the trust of the coaching staff yet.

Please continue reading *Overall, he has a great attitude, but that's about it. He's not versatile enough as a small forward and undersized as a power forward, so he needs to work harder to find his place on the court.

In summary: I don't think White will stay with the Thunder until the start of the season XD Although his NBA future seems uncertain, I still hope he keeps working hard and has the chance to be teammates with Josh Giddey in the future! --Josh Giddey *It was his first time being selected for the senior national team, and he was given a lot of responsibilities in terms of ball handling by Australian team head coach Goorjian starting from the training camp stage.

It was even rumored that with Giddey, the Australian team would no longer actively pursue Ben Simmons to join the team.

Please continue reading *It's safe to say that "Giddey was the best player on the Australian team at this World Cup".

In 5 games, he averaged the second-most minutes on the team, only behind veteran Patty Mills, with 19.4 points and 6 assists, along with 5 rebounds and 3.6 turnovers. It's hard to avoid high turnovers for a point guard like Giddey who has great spatial awareness and vision and is not afraid to take risks, but a more concerning issue is that, as mentioned by Bogdanovic on the Play One TV show, he's too eager to make a game-changing assist and often holds onto the ball for too long, which can lead to the team's stagnation... *In addition, his dismal shooting from the outside (3-point shooting percentage of only 16.7%) and numerous missed free throws were pointed out by Luka Doncic.

I hope Giddey can reflect on this shortcoming. *However, overall, it was still a good showing for his first World Cup and first matchup against Doncic. His aggressive attacks on the basket and a few impressive dunks showed his ambition, and his signature hair-flicking move has almost become his unique trademark! *He was also selected as the first recipient of the "Rising Star" award at the World Cup! In conclusion: With a lack of strong scorers on the Australian team, they were heavily favored to win a medal at this World Cup, but they fell short in the round of 16. Although it's disappointing, it also exposed some problems with the team's lineup. Giddey had a great performance, but he will face more responsibilities and challenges in the future, so he needs to keep improving his shooting and passing skills! --Luguentz Dort *He participated in the cross-year training program with the Canadian senior national team and has been playing with the team since the World Cup qualification games. Although the FIBA world rankings only place Canada at 15th, the team composed of Dort and many other active NBA players was considered to have the best chance of winning a medal.

*Dort and Dillon Brooks were positioned as 3-and-D, wing defensive locks on the team, but compared to Brooks' brilliant performance of "redeeming himself", Dort, who has been inconsistent on offense, is still the familiar Dort XD *In 6 games, Dort had a field goal percentage of >40% in 3 games and <25% in the other 3 games... He averaged 24.7 minutes per game with 8.2 points and 4.3 rebounds, and a field goal percentage of 41.2%/34.5%/55.6%. That's really the Dort we know XD *It's worth mentioning that Dort's best performance (game 2 of the group stage against Brazil) coincided with the worst performance of the Canadian team as a whole. In that game, Dort scored 17 points on 6 for 11 shooting, but the rest of his teammates, except for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, couldn't buy a basket.

*In contrast, in the first game of the group stage against Brazil, Dort didn't have a good showing (0 points on 5 attempts, the only points coming from 4 made free throws), but the Canadian team shot a 3-point percentage of 51.9%, and they lost to Brazil 77-94. It can be said that it was their worst game at this World Cup.

Please continue reading *Although I love Dort's style of play the most, he played in every game at the World Cup, but he didn't really contribute to the Canadian team, so I was a bit disappointed.

In conclusion: Although Nick Nurse, the head coach of the Canadian team, mentioned in a recent interview that they have an obligation to include Dort on the team, they also want to give him a chance to show his skills and compete for future opportunities. I still believe that Dort will continue to shine with the Thunder and bring more surprises to the Canadian team! --Davis Bertans *I have to say, it was a pleasant surprise that Bertans was selected for the Latvian team.

*Originally, he was hoping to use his big brother Kristaps Porzingis and their popularity in the same city to attract fans to come watch the games.

Please continue reading *But Porzingis withdrew from the Latvian team voluntarily due to Edgars Ieguskis' injury, so the big brother and little brother (Ieguskis returned to the team at this World Cup and averaged a high 30.8 minutes per game with 18.8 points and 6.3 rebounds) did not have the opportunity to play together for the Latvian team.

*But Bertans decided to stay and give his all for the Latvian team, hoping to let more fans see his performance.

*As a result, he succeeded, and the Latvian team advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time in the World Cup. Bertans also became a key scorer for the team.

Please continue reading *In 5 games, he averaged 20.6 minutes per game with 9.6 points and 2.8 rebounds, and a field goal percentage of 41.5%/28.6%/88.9%.

*His best performance was against the Spanish team, playing 29 minutes and scoring 23 points with 5 rebounds and a field goal percentage of 6 for 5, along with 1 assist. Unfortunately, they still lost to the Spanish team 67-85.

In conclusion: Bertans' performance wasn't too impressive, but he was consistent, and it gave me a glimpse of his future development with the Thunder. I hope he continues to play well and brings more firepower to the Thunder next season! Lastly, I just want to say: although the group stage of the World Cup is over, the performances of these 5 Thunder players have already shown their potential and room for growth. I look forward to seeing them continue to work hard and bring more surprises to the Thunder!
