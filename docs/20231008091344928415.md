  PLG Jeremy Lin announces joining New Taipei Kings

Former Kaohsiung Steel player and basketball star Jeremy Lin had an outstanding performance in the previous PLG season. During the offseason, there were various speculations about Lin's next move, including offers from Chinese teams, and the possibility of returning to the CBA. Whether he would stay in Taiwan to continue his fight with the Steel and the people of Kaohsiung, or fulfill his wish to play alongside his younger brother with the New Taipei Kings, both scenarios seemed possible. However, it was recently announced by Lin himself that he will be joining the New Taipei Kings for the upcoming season, continuing his basketball journey in Taiwan.

In the previous season, Lin made a significant impact by joining the Kaohsiung Steel midway, transforming them from a struggling team to a playoff contender. Although he suffered an injury during a crucial game and ultimately missed the playoffs, his remarkable performance during this time allowed fans to experience the charm of "Linsanity" firsthand. Welcome back, Jeremy! In the last season, Lin played 19 games, averaging 26.3 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.
