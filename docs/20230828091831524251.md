  Wilson's 53-point Performance Ties the WNBA Single-Game Scoring Record

A'ja Wilson, a two-time MVP winner, led the Las Vegas Aces to a 112-100 victory over the Atlanta Dream this morning with a career-high 53 points. Not only did Wilson's incredible performance set a new personal record for single-game scoring, but it also tied Liz Cambage's record of the highest single-game score in the league, which she achieved in 2018 against the New York Liberty.

Wilson now joins an elite group of only three players in WNBA history to score over 50 points in a single game, with Liz Cambage's 53 points and Riquna Williams' 51 points being the other two instances.

After the game, Aces' head coach Becky Hammon praised Wilson, saying, "I don't know what kind of creature she is. She runs like a deer, jumps like a cat, and catches the ball like Spider-Man." 

In addition to her remarkable scoring, Wilson achieved an impressive shooting percentage of 70%, making 16 out of 23 attempts. She also displayed her hot hand at the free-throw line, making 20 out of 21 shots. This game marked Wilson's career-high in both free-throw attempts and field goals made. 

Furthermore, Wilson excelled on the defensive end, grabbing 7 rebounds and completing 4 blocks in this game. With a total of 70 blocks this season, Wilson currently leads the entire league in that category.

When Wilson guarded the Dream's shots, they only had a 21% shooting percentage. Wilson has now scored a total of 735 points this season, surpassing her teammate Kelsey Plum's franchise record of 726 points set in 2022. Plum praised Wilson's achievement, saying, "We are witnessing a legendary talent. Wilson is one of the greatest players of all time, and she's just getting started."
