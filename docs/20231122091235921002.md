As the mid-season tournament enters its final stage, the teams that will advance are becoming clear. In the game between the Kings and the Hawks, the Kings only needed to win to secure a spot in the top eight of the mid-season tournament. Both teams engaged in a scoring battle, with each team scoring over 150 points. In the end, the Kings pulled ahead with two successful three-pointers from Buddy Hield and defeated the Hawks 157-152, advancing to the top eight of the mid-season tournament.

Both teams entered into an offensive mode early on, with Trae Young and Bogdan Bogdanovic shooting well from the outside. The Kings also had multiple players contributing on offense, but the Hawks had a higher efficiency and led 40-34 at the end of the first quarter.

The Hawks continued their hot streak, scoring over 40 points for two consecutive quarters. Bogdanovic had 22 points at halftime, and the team scored a franchise-record of 86 points, leading by 13 points. In the third quarter, Tyrese Haliburton exploded with 26 points, including 8 out of 7 three-pointers, and the Kings outscored the Hawks by 18 points, turning the game around and taking a 5-point lead going into the final quarter.

In the final quarter, the Kings made an 8-0 run to take a 13-point lead, but the Hawks called a timeout and quickly adjusted, catching up and taking the lead in the last two minutes. In the crucial moments, Hield made two key three-pointers to help the Kings regain control. With Dejounte Murray's missed layup and foul in the final seconds, the Hawks lost their chance to tie the game, and the outcome was decided. Both teams put up All-Star level stats, with Haliburton scoring 37 points and 16 assists for the Kings, while Hield contributed 24 points, making 6 out of 6 three-pointers. On the Hawks' side, Trae Young scored 38 points, Murray had 28 points, and Bogdanovic had 26 points. The Kings currently have a 3-0 record in Group A of the Eastern Conference, with only one game left against the Pistons. Regardless of the outcome of that game, the Kings will advance to the top eight of the mid-season tournament due to their head-to-head advantage.
