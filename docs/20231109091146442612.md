  University team wins SBL champion in the first appearance of the Cross-League Basketball Invitational 

The Cross-League Basketball Invitational, organized by the Chinese Basketball Association, invited university teams to participate for the first time. In March of this year, the political powerhouse of the UBA Open Men's Division, which had won three consecutive championships, made its debut and defeated the SBL former champion Taiwan Bank by 21 points after three quarters. In the end, with the all-around performance of their star point guard, You Aizhe, who scored 20 points, had 9 assists and 8 rebounds, the political powerhouse won the game with a score of 87:76.

This is the second year of the Cross-League Basketball Invitational, which was first held last year. This year's participating teams include SBL's Taiwan Bank, Taiwan Beer, and Changhua Bank, PLG's Dreamers Youth Team and the Lead Monkey Alliance, and T1 League's new team, Taipei Taishin Warriors. Political powerhouse became the first university team to receive an invitation.

Although it was a "challenge against stronger opponents", the political powerhouse, which had traveled to the United States, Beijing, Japan, and the Philippines, took the lead with 8 points led by You Aizhe in their first game. Taiwan Bank, who won the SBL championship last year, was able to catch up in the second quarter thanks to Pan Xiangwei's outside shooting. Lin Bowei's fast break gave Taiwan Bank the lead. However, after a timeout by the political powerhouse, You Aizhe immediately cut in to stop the bleeding, coupled with a buzzer-beater, allowing the political powerhouse to maintain a lead of 41:37 at halftime. In the third quarter, the political powerhouse, led by Zhuang Zhaosheng and Wu Zhikai, scored 8 points in a row with outside shooting, expanding the lead to 49:37. After left-handed foreign player Popoka made two free throws, the lead was expanded to 51:37. It wasn't until 7 minutes and 10 seconds left in the quarter that Chen Youxu scored for Taiwan Bank, but the political powerhouse continued to score quickly, extending their lead to 61:43. After Lin Zihao made an outside shot, the lead had reached 21 points. The political powerhouse scored 25 points and only allowed 8 points in the third quarter, leading 66:45 into the fourth quarter. Although Taiwan Bank's Jian Jiawei and Lin Zheting made consecutive outside shots, closing the gap to 8 points, the political powerhouse's foreign player Popoka fouled out early. However, Wu Zhikai and foreign player Mustafa continued to score, bringing the lead back to double digits. In the end, the political powerhouse won the game with a score of 87:76. Four players from the political powerhouse scored in double digits, with Song Xinhao scoring 22 points, You Aizhe scoring 20 points, 9 assists, and 8 rebounds, Lin Zihao scoring 13 points, and Popoka scoring 11 points and 15 rebounds. Chen Youxu scored the highest for Taiwan Bank with 17 points.
