In the best-of-seven NBA Finals, the Nuggets returned to their home court with a 3-1 advantage over the Miami Heat. Despite the Heat taking an early 5-0 lead, the Nuggets responded with a 12-0 run to establish their presence. The Heat, led by Bam Adebayo's 18 points, managed to take a 24-22 lead at the end of the first quarter.

The Nuggets' victory marks their first NBA championship in their 47-year franchise history. Nikola Jokic contributed 28 points and 16 rebounds, while Michael Porter Jr. added 16 points and 13 rebounds. Jamal Murray had 14 points and 8 assists. For the Heat, Jimmy Butler scored a team-high 21 points, and Bam Adebayo recorded 20 points and 12 rebounds. However, the Heat's overall rebounding disadvantage of 50-71 proved to be a significant factor in their defeat.

Looking back at the Nuggets' history, the team went through a five-year rebuilding phase before finding success with Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, and coach Michael Malone. The Nuggets became the second team from the ABA (American Basketball Association) to win an NBA championship after the league merged with the NBA in 1976.

Founded in 1967 as one of the original ABA teams, the Nuggets initially went by the names Larks and Rockets before adopting the Nuggets name in 1974. They made it to the ABA Finals in their last season before the merger but lost to the New York Nets. Throughout their history, the Nuggets have had various notable players, including Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, and Carmelo Anthony. Under coach George Karl's offensive-minded system, the Nuggets became known for their fast-paced style of play.

The Nuggets' home arena, the Pepsi Center, is located at an elevation of 5,280 feet. This high-altitude environment has earned the Nuggets a reputation for having a significant home-court advantage. Despite initially appearing overweight, Nikola Jokic transformed his physique and became an MVP-caliber player after giving up his soda-drinking habit.

Nikola Jokic, a 28-year-old Serbian center, was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft with the 41st overall pick. He quickly made a name for himself in the NBA and was named to the All-Rookie First Team. Over the years, Jokic's scoring average and rebounding numbers steadily increased. In the 2019-20 season, he averaged 19.9 points and 9.7 rebounds per game.
