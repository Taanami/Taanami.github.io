  The Deadly Allure of New York: Once Again the Promised Land

For over a decade, New York has not been a city that can attract star players to join its teams. However, this time, the team's patience may finally pay off and it wouldn't be a surprise to see New York on the list of target teams for these stars.

Unbeknownst to many, through multiple rounds of maneuvering, including signings and trades, the Knicks have finally made it back to the second round of the playoffs after a 10-year drought. The 2023-24 season will be crucial for New York.

Please continue reading to learn about the past 25 years of management and decision-making in New York, which will make one question whether the team's management truly had the intention of running a professional basketball team.

One word to describe the Knicks of the past: chaos. From the disastrous reign of Isiah Thomas as the general manager, to the shocking resignation of Donnie Walsh, to the sudden firing of Glen Grunwald, to giving Phil Jackson full control, and even making Derek Fisher the head coach, not to mention drafting Kevin Knox II, the Knicks have been making a series of baffling and questionable moves both on and off the court. This chaos has led to another word: failure.

The victory over the Cavaliers last year was only the second time the Knicks have advanced to the second round of the playoffs since 2000. The majority of the Knicks' problems stem from within, and anyone who pays even a little attention to the NBA knows that the root of the problem lies with owner James Dolan. However, in recent times, Dolan has become less involved in the team's operations, allowing for more stability and successful management under Leon Rose, William Wesley, Tom Thibodeau, and Scott Perry (who has since been let go). "He has a lot of faith and trust in our basketball operations department," said Rose when asked about Dolan's notorious reputation. "We still believe that the Knicks are an attractive and powerful team." Last season, the Knicks had a top three offense in the entire NBA, with a strong emphasis on offensive rebounds and controlling turnovers, slowing down the pace of the game, creating mismatches, and countering with Julius Randle and Jalen Brunson's one-on-one skills, while also creating opportunities and counterattacks for their teammates. The Knicks have ranked in the bottom of the league for true shooting percentage for nine consecutive seasons, second only to the Dallas Mavericks in terms of isolation, and last in terms of assist rate.

This configuration is not the typical formula for a championship team, especially with below-average defense and players not ranked in the top 20 of the league, but the Knicks have shown resilience and clutch performances, especially with the addition of Josh Hart before the trade deadline and the signing of Donte DiVincenzo in the offseason, both of which were wise moves. Hart in particular has a 58.6% field goal percentage and a 51.9% three-point percentage since joining the team.

The players' ability to execute coach Thibodeau's game strategy is undoubtedly crucial, but from an execution standpoint, discipline and patience are more important than talent and star power. The current Knicks team is competitive, confident, and full of expectations, and they believe that in the near future, with all the factors currently in place, including salary cap and team composition, they have a chance to attract a top-tier player to join their team. Please continue reading to learn about their journey and how their current progress, which may seem miraculous at the time, was built a few seasons ago. The Knicks only won 37 games in the 2021-22 season, and they did not get a draft pick that year, instead giving Brunson a max contract and refusing to trade Donovan Mitchell, despite his high value.

Today, the Knicks' victory over Mitchell's Cavaliers in the 2023 playoffs proves that their choices were not wrong.

Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid have both expressed some dissatisfaction with their current teams this summer. The current Knicks team has once again become an attractive destination for star players, with healthy salary cap space and valuable trade assets, and the ultimate incentive: being in the world's largest market, New York.

To pursue the world's best players, preparation is crucial. The Knicks are well aware of this and have already begun their preparations. Currently, Brunson is a star player, averaging 24 points, 6.2 assists, and a 41.6% three-point percentage last season, and even increased his performance to 27.8 points in the playoffs, playing all 48 minutes in a crucial game and scoring 38 points to save the team.

Quentin Grimes, Hart, and DiVincenzo are all essential role players, and if Mitchell Robinson can stay healthy, he will be a reliable center. Isaiah Hartenstein and Immanuel Quickley are also dependable bench players, while one of the team's key players, RJ Barrett, is only 23 years old.

Another star player, Randle, may have high production, but his flaws are also evident. He is the leader on the court for the Knicks, and has been selected to the All-Star team twice in the past three seasons. However, his efficiency drops significantly in the playoffs and, coupled with his tendency to hold onto the ball and commit turnovers, his efficiency was low in the 2021-22 season.

Randle set a career-high last season with an average of 25.1 points per game and his turnovers dropped to a new low since joining the Knicks, but with the addition of Brunson, it is evident that his abilities and efficiency have been unleashed. However, in the playoffs, Randle's statistics and efficiency took a major hit, with only 16.6 points per game and poor shooting percentages of 37.4/25.8/70.9, clearly struggling in high-intensity games.

Randle's performance is directly correlated to the team's overall performance. The Knicks' turnover rate and true shooting percentage dropped significantly in the playoffs, and their opponents were able to exploit their weaknesses. The Knicks need Randle to step up as a leader in crucial moments, rather than being restricted like in last season's playoffs. This is also one of the issues that Thibodeau needs to address.

As the Knicks continue to make progress, the team's management will not stop there. They still have many decisions to make, including whether to re-sign Brunson and Hartenstein, whether to target DiVincenzo and Hart in trades, and whether to trade Randle and try to attract a top-tier player to join the team in the future.

New York has once again become a promised land, and this time, their attractiveness does not just lie in the bright lights and economic power of the city, but also in the stability of the team's management and the competitiveness of the players. The Knicks have reached a turning point, and as long as they can maintain their current momentum and progress, it is only a matter of time before they become a dominant force in the NBA once again.
