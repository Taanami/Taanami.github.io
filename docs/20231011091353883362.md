  Coach Chiou Guo-Da, the Silent Cultivator of the Chang Yao Cup

"I enjoy the process of building the future for children." Please continue reading. In 1996, Chiou Guo-Da took over as the head coach of the boys' basketball team at Miaoli Mingren Junior High School. Since then, for nearly 30 years, he has remained steadfast, never forgetting his original intention to focus on education and nurturing, disregarding fame and fortune.

Having grown up as a player, Chiou became a coach after his student years. Looking back on those years, he admits that he never thought he would stay in this role for decades.

During these long years, the basketball landscape at both domestic and international levels has undergone many changes, but what remains unchanged is his dedication to grassroots basketball. The outstanding basketball players we see today, such as CBA's Guan-Da Yu, Jia-Kang Li, Jun-Xiang Lu, Jie-Min Lu, UBA's Xin-Hao Song, Lu-Shi Liu, Jie-Cheng Zhang, Guan-Lun Peng, HBL's Cheng-Han Tsai, Guan-Zhong Chen, Yi Quan, Jun-Yao Zhang, and the 2023 World University Games representative Zhang Zhen-Ya, all come from his nurturing.

Furthermore, Miaoli Mingren Junior High School has achieved remarkable results in the JBHL over the years. Coach Chiou Guo-Da has been cultivating grassroots basketball at Mingren for nearly 30 years. He believes that besides focusing on basketball skills, grassroots basketball education should also emphasize the character development and academic achievement of players. "A tree with deep roots won't be toppled by the wind." Having a strong foundation during student years is crucial for future success. Moreover, Coach Chiou has been quietly helping underprivileged children, demonstrating the true meaning of education without distinction.

"Grassroots basketball needs both hardware and software. Hardware includes venues, training environments, and funding sources, and the regional differences can lead to urban-rural disparities. It's essential for coaches promoting grassroots basketball to minimize such gaps.

As for the software aspect, it involves consistent teaching materials and instructional content. A complete and seamless transition from beginners to professionals can have a positive impact."

The progress made by Japan in the past decade is evident to all. Coach Chiou believes that as another East Asian country, if Japan can achieve it, Taiwan can do even better. The tenth edition of the Chang Yao Cup awarded Coach Chiou Guo-Da the "Best Contribution Award" at the opening ceremony. "The Chang Yao Cup has grown larger and more refined over the years, providing substantial assistance from high school to university and from domestic to international levels." Coach Chiou expressed his gratitude for being honored with this award by the Chang Yao Cup and Chairman Xie Jian-Guo. He said, "I am surprised and delighted. In Taiwan, there are definitely more people dedicated to grassroots sports and education than just me."

During the award ceremony for Coach Chiou at the tenth Chang Yao Cup, nearly 30 young players attended to express their gratitude.

"Meticulously cultivating grassroots basketball is a spirit. As long as one is willing to persist and work hard, they will eventually be seen by more people and even be able to pass on and spread the importance of grassroots nurturing." Coach Chiou humbly expressed his gratitude and acknowledged that receiving this award only represents a representative among countless individuals dedicated to grassroots basketball. He hopes to encourage and share with more individuals who are also committed to promoting and preserving grassroots basketball. Grassroots education is a journey that has no end but a long road. While the future may not be clear, the beauty lies in appreciating the small changes along the way.
