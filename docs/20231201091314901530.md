 Asia U16 Men's Basketball Team Misses Out on Participation, Basketball Association Protests East Asia Basketball Association's Decision

The U16 Asia Youth Men's Basketball Tournament, which was scheduled to take place in Qatar from September 17 to 24, has recently been met with the news that our country's representative team may not be able to participate. Chinese Basketball Association secretary general Li Yunxiang explained today that there are a total of three spots available for the East Asia region this year. However, without discussing with other member countries, the East Asia Basketball Association has decided to use rankings instead of qualifying games to determine participation, resulting in our country being unable to participate as the fourth-ranked team in East Asia. The association has already sent a letter of protest. In the past, there were 16 spots available in the U16 Asia Youth Tournament, with the host and defending champion automatically qualifying, and 2 spots each for the West Asia, East Asia, and Persian Gulf regions, and 1 spot each for the remaining 3 regions and Oceania. The remaining 4 spots are determined based on the performance of each region in the previous tournament. This year, the East Asia region was awarded "2+1" spots. Li Yunxiang, secretary general of the Chinese Basketball Association, stated that the association had not received any information about the tournament this year, and after inquiring with other participating countries and sending a letter to the Asian Basketball Federation, they were informed that the qualifications for each region were determined by the respective regional basketball associations. Without a meeting between chairman Yao Ming and other member countries, the East Asia region decided to use rankings instead of qualifying games to determine qualifications, and our country was ranked behind China, Japan, and South Korea, resulting in being unable to participate. Li Yunxiang emphasized that this decision made by the East Asia Basketball Association was not known to member countries such as Hong Kong and Macau, and South Korea and Japan only found out during a U16 video conference that our country was not on the list of participating teams. This prompted the association to send a letter of protest and request for meeting records. Macau Basketball Association secretary general Hu Shufen, who also serves as secretary general of the East Asia Basketball Association, personally apologized, but it was too late to change the fact that our country would not be able to participate this year. The coaching staff and some members of our U16 representative team had already gone to Ulaanbaatar to participate in the East Asian Youth Games and won a silver medal. In order to avoid affecting the players' mood, the basketball association waited until after the tournament to inform them of the possibility that they may not be able to participate this year and proposed the idea of finding other tournaments for the U16 team to continue training. However, with the HBL qualification games approaching, many schools hope that the players can return early.
