 Dwight Howard, also known as the "Beast" in the NBA, was not able to join the Golden State Warriors as reported by journalist Shams Charania on Friday morning. The Warriors are looking to keep their roster flexible and will not be signing Howard or any other veteran center. Earlier today, Howard posted on social media using a play on words with "Warriors" to encourage himself to not be afraid of any challenges. Last year, Howard came to Taiwan and caused a frenzy with his dominant performances, selling out tickets for the first few games. During the off-season, it was clear that he wanted to come back to Taiwan and play another season, after averaging 23.2 points, 16.2 rebounds, and 5 assists for the Cloud Leopards last year, earning him the T1 League rebounding title, Best Import Player, and Defensive First Team honors.
