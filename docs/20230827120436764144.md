 Bronny James and Shareef O'Neal, both living under the shadow of their famous fathers, also face heart problems.

Article: Yesterday, Bronny James, the eldest son of LeBron James, collapsed during basketball practice and experienced a momentary cardiac arrest. Fortunately, after receiving immediate medical attention, he is now out of the intensive care unit and is expected to be fine. However, this collapse could potentially undermine all the efforts he has put in so far. As the son of LeBron, Bronny has had to face more attention and pressure than the average "baller generation" player. After all, he is not just the son of a player, but the son of a legendary figure with a historic position in the entire NBA. This naturally amplifies the scrutiny of his basketball talent.

However, compared to his father's high school years, Bronny's dominance is not as remarkable. Although he still possesses good innate qualities, he has not displayed the same level of dominance that his father did in high school. He was even considered a "tiger father's son" at one point. Despite facing unfriendly criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continued to improve his skills. In his senior season, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, earning him a spot on the McDonald's All-American high school team. He was also given the title of a five-star high school player by some basketball media outlets and received basketball scholarships from some NCAA Division I schools.

These achievements have significantly boosted Bronny's draft projection, going from a possible undrafted player to having the chance to compete for a first-round or even lottery pick.

Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father LeBron's fame. LeBron himself has stated that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, there is a high chance he will join his son's team and play alongside him. This "selecting a son for the father" move undoubtedly has had an impact on Bronny's market value. However, we must not overlook Bronny's own efforts. He ultimately chose to attend the University of Southern California and plans to enter the draft after completing his freshman season. Before starting his college career, he posted on his social media, expressing his determination to prove the doubters wrong.

However, the heart problem that has arisen before the start of his college season casts a shadow over his future. Similar to Bronny's case, this situation reminds me of another "baller generation" player, Shareef O'Neal, the son of basketball star Shaquille O'Neal. Shareef had achieved some success in high school, being regarded as a four-star high school player. He also intended to enter the NBA after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, he was diagnosed with a heart abnormality that posed a high risk to his life and required emergency surgery.

The post-surgery rest and rehabilitation forced Shareef to stay away from high-intensity competition for a whole 11 months. This setback was detrimental to a rising player like him. Losing a year during the golden development period could significantly impact his skill level and competitiveness. Furthermore, considering Shareef's condition, which is less dominant even in the more intense NCAA, college coaches were hesitant to give him too much time. As a result, his college performance plummeted, and he ultimately faced the possibility of going undrafted. "I have always told Shareef that he will never be the next me," Shaquille said. "I want him to play his own game, his own style. Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the name O'Neal, but he still needs to create his own path." Shareef is currently waiting for an opportunity in the developmental league. Despite only averaging 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the previous season, overcoming the shadow of his heart condition is a significant progress. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be shackled by his father's achievements and reputation and to bravely pursue his own chosen path.

I believe LeBron sees Bronny in the same way. Regardless of whether it affects his draft position or not, it will not diminish LeBron's love for his child. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by injuries and can showcase his value in the upcoming season.
