 During the NBA offseason, Jayson Tatum considered having surgery on his left wrist but ultimately decided against it after evaluation.

Many NBA players accumulate injuries throughout their careers, and some choose not to address them. Today, news broke that Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum has been dealing with a wrist injury. However, after assessment, he opted for non-surgical treatment.

ESPN reporter Ramona Shelburne discussed Tatum on a recent show, revealing that he had considered undergoing surgery this offseason to address a non-shooting hand (left hand) wrist injury (non-displaced fracture). This injury has been bothering him since the 2023 playoffs. However, after expert evaluation, he chose to manage the injury. Shelburne also mentioned that Tatum felt great during training this summer, especially while shooting, and the injury did not hinder him. The reporter also noted that Tatum will have a significant increase in ball-handling responsibilities this season due to Smart's departure. Tatum has already taken on a ball-handling role in the past three playoff seasons, so playing in this position is not an issue for him. Previously, this same reporter mentioned that Tatum would play more in a ball-handling position in the upcoming season. At that time, it was due to Malcolm Brogdon's uncertain playing time in the new season because of trade issues during the offseason, and Tatum would step up as the primary ball-handler for the Celtics.
