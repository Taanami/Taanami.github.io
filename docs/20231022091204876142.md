 The Golden State Warriors have decided to cut Rudy Gay and Rodney McGruder to maintain a 13-man roster for the start of the season.

According to reporter Shams Charania, the Warriors have made the decision to waive the two players, who were signed before the preseason. Gay had agreed to a one-year contract with the Warriors before training camp, but was unable to secure a spot on the final roster. He will continue to search for a team to play his 18th season in the NBA. McGruder also signed a training camp deal with the Warriors, but was ultimately not included on the final roster. Last season, he averaged 5.7 points, 2.3 rebounds, 0.9 assists, and 0.5 steals per game. The Warriors will enter the season with a 13-man roster in order to have more flexibility with their lineup and team salary. They are expected to add a 14th player to the team within the first two weeks of the season.
