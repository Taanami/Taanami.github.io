  Siege Lion, Taishin War God, and Lin Bing-Sheng have no consensus, the Basketball Association of Taiwan (B.A.T.) states that they will no longer negotiate

In regards to the contract dispute between the Siege Lion basketball team, Taishin War God basketball team, and Lin Bing-Sheng, the Basketball Association of Taiwan (B.A.T.) held the first mediation meeting on 4th September (Monday). After recent discussions within both parties, a consensus could not be reached. Therefore, based on respect for the wishes of both teams, the B.A.T. will no longer assist in further mediation matters. Regarding this case, the B.A.T. will show respect and understanding if either team takes any legal actions in the future.

Furthermore, the B.A.T. will continue to establish and improve relevant systems within the domestic basketball industry, aiming to create a healthier basketball environment. The B.A.T. plans to implement the "Sports Agent System" starting from 1st January next year (2024), with the hope that through the establishment and implementation of this system, protection and fair transactions can be provided for the domestic basketball environment, teams, and players, so as to prevent contract disputes from affecting the rights and interests of players and teams.
