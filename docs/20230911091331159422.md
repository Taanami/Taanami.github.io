 Chat after the United States lost to Lithuania

The United States team lost the game... but is it really that serious? First of all, in terms of substance, the significance of this defeat is not very important. Please continue reading because the United States does not value the World Cup (including the predecessor, the FIBA World Championship) as much as the Olympics, so naturally, the results are not as good as the Olympics. Here are the results of the United States team (don't call it the Dream Team, it's unfair to the players) after NBA players were allowed to participate:

Olympics: 92ü•á, 96ü•á, 00ü•á, 04ü•â, 08ü•á, 12ü•á, 16ü•á, 20ü•á (a total of 7 gold and 1 bronze, experiencing 3 losses in 2004 and 1 loss in 2020).

World Cup (including the predecessor, the FIBA World Championship): 94ü•á, 98ü•â, 02Ô∏è‚É£, 06ü•â, 10ü•á, 14ü•á, 197Ô∏è‚É£ (a total of 3 gold and 2 bronze, with the 1998 team composed of secondary league or overseas players due to NBA labor disputes; the 2002 team experiencing 3 losses on US soil; the 2006 team experiencing 1 loss; the 2019 team experiencing 2 losses).

So why does the United States still make so much effort to form a team for the competition? Is it to promote national prestige? It might have been the case when it was still the Dream Team, but after basketball became globalized, the strength of various countries has rapidly approached, so promoting national prestige is obviously not something that the United States can easily achieve now. The author believes that the main purpose is still for the Olympics, especially after FIBA made the World Cup a way to qualify for the Olympics, countries have attached more importance to the World Cup than before. In this World Cup, FIBA will generate 7 Olympic tickets based on the rankings of participating countries in each continent, including the top 2 in Europe, the top 2 in the Americas (United States and Canada), the top 1 in Asia (Japan), the top 1 in Africa (South Sudan), and the top 1 in Oceania (Australia). Therefore, the author believes that the main goal of the United States team's participation in this competition has been achieved, which is to secure a ticket to the Paris Olympics.

Secondly, it is to train players for the Olympics next year. First, in the position of big men, although JJJ may not be a towering presence and may not necessarily be able to defend against European or Australian big men, his ability to protect the rim, help defense, and transition between offense and defense are all suitable for the United States team... His current problem is to handle fouls well and to stabilize his outside shooting to create space. 

Next is the United States team's main wing player. I think A. Edwards' performance in this competition has already proved that he is at least a version of Kobe for the United States team, if not Wade.

However, in the past, the United States team had big wings like Melo or KD, but they are not seen in this team, which is a big crisis. The advantages of big wings in the past are as follows: they can directly shoot from outside after holding the ball, and their three-point shooting is deadly and almost unstoppable. Additionally, compared to other countries' players in the paint, the United States' big wings may have a slight height disadvantage, but they have relatively better physical conditions and can also be used to support the paint when necessary. Unfortunately, B. Ingram, who was expected to be the small KD in this competition, surprised everyone by underperforming from warm-up matches to the actual games.

As for Paolo Banchero, I hope Kerr does not use him as a big man. It would be better to train him as an international forward considering his skills.
