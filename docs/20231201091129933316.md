  Iron Warriors Strike Back: Rapid Adjustments in G2

After more than a year, the Changhua Gymnasium reopened and both teams spent some time adjusting their shooting in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the Dreamers took the lead with their aggressive offense, easily drawing fouls from the Iron Warriors with their smooth attacks. The outside shooting of the two foreign players also gradually improved, creating a gap for the Iron Warriors who were struggling to score. However, after halftime adjustments, the Iron Warriors proved their strength.

On the defensive end, although some players may still face challenges with their stamina, their active footwork and effort in boxing out and fighting for rebounds were evident, boosting morale and stifling the Dreamers' offense. On the offensive end, with faster passing and coordination from Iron Rice, the male model and AB exploded, becoming unstoppable and ultimately securing the victory.
