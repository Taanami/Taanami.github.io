  Germany Defeats the United States, Ready to Challenge the World Number One at the 2023 World Cup

After recovering from their first defeat of the tournament against Lithuania, the United States regained their defensive strength in the quarterfinals of the 2023 World Cup, completely suppressing Italy's defense. They made a strong comeback and defeated Italy, securing a spot in the World Cup semifinals. Their next opponent will be Germany, who gave the United States a tough time in a friendly match.

In the friendly match, the United States was trailing by as much as 16 points, and their defense couldn't contain Germany's offense in the first three quarters. It was only in the final quarter, with increased defensive pressure and the outstanding performance of Anthony Edwards, Austin Reaves, and Tyrese Haliburton on the perimeter, that the United States managed to turn the game around. This victory proved that Germany had a well-established team chemistry before the start of the tournament. Germany is the only undefeated team in this World Cup before the semifinals, and their defense is extremely tight. In this World Cup, all teams have shown high offensive efficiency, but Germany's defense has consistently kept opponents' scores below 80 points, with their highest conceded score being 82 against Australia.

Their offensive characteristic is low turnover rate, averaging only 10.2 turnovers per game in the first six matches, which is only slightly higher than Serbia's 9.5 turnovers among the top four teams.

The primary ball-handler in the FIBA system is Dennis Schröder, who has a different level of efficiency. Besides the previous game against Latvia, he has displayed excellent skills in driving, mid-range shooting, and three-point shooting.

The Wagner brothers, Moritz and Franz, who both play for the Orlando Magic, are the main players in the frontcourt, contributing to rebounding, defense, and agility. Especially Franz, with his height advantage, can also handle the ball well. His versatile and steady playing style provides stability to the team. After resting for four games, his return against Latvia proved to be crucial.

In addition to the usual high pick-and-roll and screens, Germany's offensive tactics involve active and clear player movements and screens. They are willing to make an extra pass to create better opportunities. Apart from Schröder, multiple players can assist and quickly change the direction of the play. The main players all have decent passing abilities, ensuring a balanced offense.

Isaac Bonga, with a height of 6-8, is an excellent wing defender. Maodo Lo, a guard from Milan, and Andreas Obst, a guard from Bayern Munich, have a three-point shooting percentage close to 45%, making them the main outside shooters.

Johannes Voigtmann, a 6-11 center, is the main center with average athleticism and rebounding skills. He, along with NBA-level center Daniel Theis, acts as the guardians of the paint.

Despite having four NBA-experienced players (Wagner brothers, Theis, Schröder), Germany does not solely rely on them. In the game against Latvia, Germany used a nine-man rotation, with only Schröder playing exactly 30 minutes, and no other player exceeding 25 minutes. The team's energy distribution is well-balanced. Except for guard David Kramer, forward Niels Giffey, and young point guard Justus Hollatz, who have fewer appearances, all other players are ready to contribute. The biggest problem for the United States in this tournament is their defense in the paint and rebounding. Germany's frontline, consisting of players over 6-10 such as Voigtmann and the Wagner brothers, as well as the 6-9 Johannes Thiemann and 6-8 Theis, will pose significant challenges to the United States.

Although they don't have exceptional rebounders and their physique is not as robust as traditional Eastern European teams, Theis's toughness, Bonga and the Wagner brothers' agility, Thiemann's activity, and Voigtmann's height will cause difficulties for the United States.

Even without a heavyweight tank like Jonas Valanciunas, Germany is likely to try to create trouble for Jaren Jackson Jr., the starting center for the United States, by drawing fouls.

Under the leadership of head coach Gordie Herbert, Germany has a well-established defensive rebounding system, with a defensive rebounding rate of 77.3%, ranking first in the tournament. They only allow opponents to grab 8 offensive rebounds per game, which is also among the top rankings. It will be challenging for the United States to gain an advantage in offensive rebounds. Defensive transition is crucial for Germany, especially considering that the United States' athleticism has made them the best in fast break scoring.

Usually, the United States has an advantage in terms of physical fitness and depth. Thanks to the schedule, they have had an extra day of rest before the semifinals. Germany will need to maintain a high intensity throughout the game to sustain against them.

Franz Wagner mentioned in an interview before the semifinals: "In a 40-minute game, we need to work together as a team. Individual performances won't make a big difference. We must compete as a whole team, and once we do that, we can defeat any opponent!" It may sound like a cliché, but it is the key to winning. Germany doesn't have a superstar like Luka Doncic or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander who can single-handedly carry the team; they rely on teamwork. The game where Lithuania defeated the United States is evidence of this. Lithuania's highest scorer in that game had only 15 points, but they had seven players scoring in double digits, and two players scored 9 points each, with a total of nine three-pointers made by nine different players.

Rebounding is also a collective effort, with seven players grabbing offensive rebounds. With their all-around offensive firepower and a determined effort to fight for rebounds, Lithuania secured the victory.
