 Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic wrote NBA history by becoming the first player ever to achieve 250 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in the first five games of a season. In a close game against the San Antonio Spurs, Doncic scored 51 points, including two crucial free throws and two rebounds in the final 4.5 seconds, leading the Mavericks to a narrow 126-125 victory.

Luka Doncic, born on February 28, 1999, is a Slovenian professional basketball player who primarily plays as a point guard for the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA. He was part of the Slovenian national team that won their first-ever EuroBasket championship in 2017 and was named to the All-Tournament Team.

In 2019, Doncic was awarded the NBA Rookie of the Year and has since been selected to the All-NBA First Team three times. Recently, he achieved an impressive triple-double with 60 points, 21 rebounds, and 10 assists in an overtime game against the New York Knicks. In the following game against the Houston Rockets, he recorded another triple-double with 35 points, 12 rebounds, and 13 assists.

With his 51-point performance in this game, Doncic has scored over 50 points in three of the first five games of the season. He also becomes the first player in NBA history to reach 250 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in the first five games.

Dallas Mavericks center Christian Wood expressed his amazement, saying, "It's incredible. In my seven years in the league, I've never seen anyone do what he does. He plays like an MVP, and he's clearly one of the league's best players." Wood contributed 25 points in the game, while Tim Hardaway Jr. and Spencer Dinwiddie scored 14 and 11 points, respectively.

For the Spurs, Keldon Johnson led the team in scoring with 30 points, followed by Jeremy Sochan with 20 points. Jakob Poeltl recorded a double-double with 19 points and 15 rebounds, and Tre Jones and Zach Collins contributed 18 and 13 points, respectively. The Mavericks had a 17-point lead at one point in the game but almost let it slip away. With 3.6 seconds left, the Spurs' Jones had two free throws. After making the first one, he intentionally missed the second one. Despite having the opportunity to tie the game, the Spurs failed to convert. With the Mavericks leading by just one point, Doncic missed both free throws in the final 1.5 seconds but secured the rebound after the second miss and ran out the clock, securing the Mavericks' 126-125 victory.
