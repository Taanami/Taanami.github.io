Even before retiring, Deng started giving back to his hometown by carrying the flag of South Sudan basketball.

At the same time, Deng's foundation not only assists in the education, sports, and counseling of people with disabilities but also serves as a major source of funding for the South Sudan men's and women's basketball teams.

"We have built a school in South Sudan, with nearly 2,000 students enrolled, and we have provided over 300 scholarships," Deng said. "Some of them have become doctors or have pursued non-basketball-related professions. With scholarships and various resources, the seedlings in South Sudan can grow and thrive in all aspects." Deng is dedicated to reducing local conflicts and promoting peace in his motherland through the NGO organization "Enough Project" and plays an important role in achieving this goal.

In addition, Deng has promoted the construction of 12 basketball courts and sports changing rooms in South Sudan and received a humanitarian award from the United Nations in 2008 for his contribution to the construction and community development of South Sudan.

The ongoing civil war in South Sudan has been the issue Deng most wants to solve, and he uses his expertise in sports as a platform to raise funds, provide assistance, and create opportunities. "South Sudan basketball is undoubtedly what I most want to share with everyone," Deng said. "A portion of the funds will be donated to the Deng Basketball Academy, as well as to help the community, such as introducing more wheelchairs, enabling doctors to visit more villages and promote and advocate for mental health-related issues, which are major problems in the South Sudanese community."

In 2012, the NBA founded NBA Africa, which includes basketball training academies, facilities, and the organization of the African league, as well as promoting social issues such as gender equality and improving the African economy. In addition to Deng, former NBA players Grant Hill, Ian Mahinmi, Dikembe Mutombo, and Joakim Noah are investors, and former US President Barack Obama is also an investor and strategic partner.

Deng grew up in South Sudan and comes from a family of leaders in various generations. His father even served as a government official, including as deputy prime minister. When the second civil war broke out in Sudan, Deng's family first fled to Egypt and then sought political asylum in the UK. Deng also had the opportunity to learn from former NBA player Manute Bol during his time in Egypt, which set him on the path to basketball. Bol's humanitarian efforts in Sudan are more famous than his ten-year NBA career. He was a member of the advisory board of Sudan Sunrise, an organization dedicated to promoting Sudanese reconciliation and establishing 41 schools in South Sudan. Bol founded the Ring True Foundation to raise funds for the reconstruction and assistance of Sudan and invested most of his NBA salary in the foundation. "He is not only an African basketball legend but also an important figure in helping South Sudan's independence," Deng said.

Deng continued Bol's torch and continued to assist South Sudan through basketball. The outdoor basketball court in Juba, South Sudan, named after Bol, has over 1,000 children learning basketball. South Sudan's basketball uprising. Deng first returned to South Sudan's land in 2010, and in 2011, he donated part of his salary to help people who were displaced by the Sudanese civil war and turmoil to provide them with transportation tickets so they could return home to vote in the independence referendum. South Sudan officially declared independence in July 2011.

Around the same time, Deng became the president of the South Sudan Basketball Association and received official recognition from FIBA in December 2013.

Although Deng's resources have helped, the basketball resources in South Sudan are still lacking. Apart from the outdoor courts built by Deng, there are no comprehensive training facilities, so international games often require early arrival for practice. "Before joining the UK team, Sudan came to recruit me. At that time, the country was in a civil war, and I felt it was not appropriate, so I refused. But the idea of representing Sudan has always echoed in my heart." After establishing the basketball association in 2011, Deng has been in contact with many local South Sudanese players who have the qualifications to represent the country. "After establishing the basketball association, I felt that South Sudanese players cherished this opportunity very much. They not only have the chance to represent the country in games but also feel the support of the people and enhance the country's image." Deng has maintained contact with South Sudanese players even while playing in the NBA, including arranging training camps and games.
