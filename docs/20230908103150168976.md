 Bronny James and Shareef O'Neal both live under the shadow of their famous fathers and face heart problems.

Bronny James, the eldest son of LeBron James, collapsed during a training session yesterday and experienced a momentary cardiac arrest. Fortunately, after being promptly rushed to the hospital, he is now out of the intensive care unit and recovering well. However, this incident could potentially undermine all the efforts he has made so far.

As the son of LeBron James, Bronny has had to deal with more attention and pressure than your average "hoops prodigy". After all, he is not just the son of a basketball player, but the son of a legendary figure with a historical standing in the NBA. Naturally, his basketball talent has been scrutinized more closely. However, compared to his father's high school years, Bronny's dominance on the court is not as remarkable. Although he still possesses decent innate abilities, he has not displayed the same level of domination that his father once did in high school. In fact, during his early high school years, he was even considered a "chip off the old block".

Despite facing unfavorable criticism from the outside world, Bronny has persevered. Through his own efforts, he has continuously improved his skills and achieved an impressive record of 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists in his senior year. He was also selected for the McDonald's All-American High School Team and received the title of a five-star high school player from some basketball media outlets. Additionally, he secured basketball scholarships from some top-tier NCAA Division I schools.

These accomplishments have significantly boosted Bronny's draft prediction, from potentially going undrafted to having a chance at being a first-round or even lottery pick. Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father's reputation. LeBron himself has even mentioned that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, there is a high chance he will join his son's team and play alongside him. This "son picks father" move undoubtedly has an impact on Bronny's market value. However, it should not overshadow his own efforts. In the end, he chose the University of Southern California and plans to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. Prior to enrolling in college, he posted on his social media, expressing his determination to prove the doubters wrong.

However, the heart problem that has arisen before the start of the new college season has cast a shadow over Bronny's future. Just like in the case of Shareef O'Neal, the son of basketball star Shaquille O'Neal. During his high school years, Shareef indeed achieved some notable performances and was recognized as a four-star high school player by sports media. He was also expected to enter the NBA after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, he was diagnosed with a heart abnormality that posed a high risk to his life and required emergency surgery.

The post-surgery recovery and rehabilitation caused Shareef to be away from high-intensity games for a whole 11 months. This was a significant setback for a rising player, as it meant wasting a crucial period of development. His skills and competitiveness might have fallen behind significantly. Moreover, considering Shareef's condition, he was no longer a dominant presence even in the more intense NCAA games. Coaches in college, fearing the risk of a relapse and considering his performance, could not afford to give Shareef too much time. As a result, his college performance declined significantly, and he ultimately faced the fate of going undrafted.

"I always tell Shareef that he will never be the next me." "I want him to play his own game, in his own style." "Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the name O'Neal, but he still needs to create his own path." "Back then, I had the pressure to succeed because I needed to improve my life." "But Shareef didn't have that pressure, so I hope he can find his own goals and strive for them." Currently, Shareef is still developing in the G League, waiting for an opportunity. Despite only averaging 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist last season, his recovery from the shadow of his heart condition is a significant progress. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be defined by his father's achievements and reputation, and to bravely pursue his own chosen path. I believe LeBron has a similar perspective on Bronny. Regardless of how it may affect his draft position, it will not diminish LeBron's love for his child. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by any injuries and will showcase his own value in the upcoming season.
