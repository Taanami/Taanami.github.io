The PLG Dreamers announced today that they will be hosting the "Dream Collaboration" exchange match, bringing together teams from two leagues. They have invited the Taipei Fubon Warriors, Taoyuan Puyuan Navigation Primates, T1 New Taipei CTBC Brothers, and Kaohsiung FamilyMart SeaHorses. The five teams will converge at the Dreamers' home base in Taichung on October 21 and 22 for the competition.

The Dreamers stated that the purpose of this exchange match is to foster mutual communication between different league teams. Not only will it allow players to accumulate experience through the games and adapt to changes on the field, but it will also stimulate unique sparks through diverse match-ups, enhancing the entertainment value of the games.

The Dreamers also expressed their gratitude to the participating teams and hope to have more teams join in the future, enriching and deepening the exchange between teams. This will provide fans with the opportunity to enjoy more exciting matches. The match will consist of four quarters, with each quarter lasting 12 minutes. Each team can register up to three foreign players, and a total of eight players can participate in each quarter. If a player accumulates six personal fouls, they will be disqualified from the game. In the final two minutes of the decisive quarter (fourth quarter or overtime), each team can call for a 30-second timeout. Apart from these adjustments, the other competition rules will follow the latest FIBA regulations. The "Dream Collaboration" exchange match will kick off at the Dreamers' home base in Taichung on the weekend of October 21 and 22. Tickets for the matches will be available for purchase through the ibon ticketing system, and the matches will be broadcasted on MOMOTV channel 75. This allows fans who are unable to attend the games in person to enjoy the exciting matches through live streaming.
