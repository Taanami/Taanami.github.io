 New Orleans Pelicans forward Trey Murphy suffered a meniscus injury during a scrimmage on Wednesday and immediately underwent evaluation and treatment. Today, the results came out and Murphy has decided to undergo surgery, which is expected to sideline him for 10-12 weeks. The earliest he can return is mid-November, meaning he will miss the start of the season. Initial reports suggested there were two ways to handle the meniscus injury, and Murphy opted for surgery, which also requires a longer recovery time and will impact the Pelicans' frontline strength at the start of the season. Murphy averaged 14.5 points and 3.6 rebounds per game last season, making him a key young player for the Pelicans to develop.
