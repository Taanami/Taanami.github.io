  Fulfilling the Commitment Behind Kyle Kuzma's New Contract

When Washington Wizards star Kyle Kuzma was asked about how he would handle his $102 million, four-year contract during a press conference, the young player expressed his satisfaction. Kuzma said, "Honestly, I've got everything I need. I now have the ability to retire my mom early." Karri Kuzma has been working as an office manager in the dental industry for 15 years.

Last year, the Flint, Michigan native began working remotely for a dental implant company. In August 2022, Kuzma told his mother that he wanted her to retire after he signed his next contract.

"This moment made me realize how fortunate everything is. I always knew my son was talented, but this feels like waking up from a dream," Karri Kuzma told Andscape. So, what's next for Karri Kuzma, who will retire at such a young age? She will oversee the Kyle Kuzma Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping children, young people, and families through sports, education, and life experiences. On January 18, Kuzma donated $1 million to the YMCA in his hometown of Flint, saying, "This place shaped my life and made me who I am today." Karri also plans to continue living in the Flint area and work there as a part-time massage therapist.

Karri Kuzma says that her impending retirement has made her deeply appreciate the generational wealth her son brings to the family. "I feel really lucky, not everyone gets to retire at 50. I'm truly blessed, and I cherish the freedom of not having to clock in and out of work. I should start working full-time for his foundation in August," Karri Kuzma said. The press conference for the new contract was held at the Thomas & Mack Center during the NBA Summer League, which is a fitting location as it is where he first made a name for himself with the Los Angeles Lakers.

In the 2017 NBA Summer League, Kuzma averaged 21.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 1.4 blocks, and 1.1 steals per game, and scored 30 points with 10 rebounds in the championship game, earning him the MVP title.

The Lakers' NBA Summer League championship roster included Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Ivica Zubac, Alex Caruso, Thomas Bryant, and P.J. Dozier. "Well, I was nervous in my first Summer League game. I came off the bench and scored 9 points with 4 rebounds against the LA Clippers. I was really nervous in the first half, but I played well in the second half. We made a comeback, although we lost the game, it gave me confidence. In the game against Boston next, I scored over 30 points, and the arena was packed throughout the game. From that moment on, I've been running on this path, and it's been a wonderful time," Kuzma told Andscape. "I'm happy to have played for the Lakers in the Summer League; it was probably the greatest Summer League team ever. We sold out the seats at the Thomas & Mack Center for every game. It's crazy for someone from Utah," Kuzma said. As a rookie, Kuzma set a goal to become a stable NBA player and earn over $100 million in his career, despite his rookie salary being only $1.4 million. "When I got drafted, that was my goal. I didn't know where my career would go. But throughout my entire career, I was single-mindedly focused on earning $100 million," Kuzma said.

The player, who was selected to the All-NBA Rookie Team in 2018, averaged 16.1 points and 6.3 rebounds in his first season with the Lakers.

Kuzma won an NBA championship with the Lakers in 2020 and averaged 15.2 points and 5.6 rebounds for the team from 2018 to 2021. On December 20, 2020, he signed a three-year, $40 million contract extension with the Lakers. However, on August 6, 2021, Kuzma was traded to the Wizards as part of the Russell Westbrook trade.

In his second season with the Wizards, Kuzma averaged a career-high 21.2 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game. On June 24, 2022, the Wizards traded their second-leading scorer, Bradley Beal, to the Phoenix Suns.

"Frankly, it's a business. For both parties involved in a long-term partnership, parting ways may be the best choice. He is one of the greatest players in Washington, D.C. history. Clearly, with the arrival of new leadership, they wanted to make changes. For Beal, he wanted to go somewhere competitive. So, it's a good opportunity for both sides," Kuzma said about Beal.
