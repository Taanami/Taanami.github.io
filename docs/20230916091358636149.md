 In the FIBA World Cup round of 16 yesterday, Lithuanian player Vaidas Kariniauskas successfully made a low post move against Lakers player Austin Reaves and stuck out his tongue at him. After the game, Lithuania emerged victorious and this image was widely shared on social media.

In an interview after the game, Vaidas Kariniauskas talked about the tongue gesture, saying, "It has nothing to do with what happened on the court. It's simply a display of my passion for the game. Last season, I played with Austin Reaves' brother on the same team, and before the game, we had a lot of conversations. Reaves' brother told me, 'Trash talk Reaves a bit more,' so I did (stuck out my tongue)."

Austin Reaves' brother is Spencer Reaves, 27 years old, who played for Bamberg in the top tier of the German league last season, averaging 6.7 points and 2 rebounds per game. He will be playing for SC Rasta Vechta in the German second-tier league next season. Apart from trash-talking Reaves, there were also images of Lithuania celebrating after the game. In one of the photos, Vaidas Kariniauskas, the same player, was seen wearing a USA team hat in the locker room, which sparked discussions. Yesterday, the USA suffered a defeat against Lithuania, trailing by a significant margin in the first half and making efforts to catch up in the second half but falling short. They finished second in the group stage and will face Italy in the quarterfinals.
