 During the first pre-season game between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers, Jaylen Brown was noticed by commentators for wearing his shorts backwards. This was a funny moment during the game as the commentators joked about who would tell him about his mistake. Despite the wardrobe mishap, Brown still managed to contribute 19 points to the Celtics' victory over the 76ers. The Celtics' key players, including newly signed Payton Pritchard who scored a team-high of 24 points, all played in the game and secured the team's first pre-season win. The commentator also mentioned that he had never seen a player wear their shorts backwards before and only noticed because he saw the Celtics' logo on the back.
