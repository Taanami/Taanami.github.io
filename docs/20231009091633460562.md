  Observation of the Preseason Game: Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers

After a long wait, the preseason game has finally arrived. It is an opportunity to find the right chemistry among the players. Mazzulla started with a twin tower lineup, which indeed requires the most synergy. However, I have to complain about our opening introductions, which seem to look the same every year. The creative department needs to step up.

Updating today's news, Pritchard has signed a four-year, $30 million contract extension with the team. Although there were rumors about it earlier, it is still somewhat surprising that he chose to extend his contract in this situation. After all, the team already has White and Holiday occupying the position, and it is uncertain if he fits into the team's future plans. Additionally, he has not shown consistent performance that merits trust. However, considering his affordable salary, the team has shown trust in him, which might help him break free from constraints.

Jay Scrubb, who had an impressive performance in the summer league and signed a two-way contract with the team, tore his ACL during training. There is no further update at the moment, but it is certain that he will need to rest for a period of time. It's quite a pity.

Today, Mazzulla started with the twin towers, pairing them with White in the backcourt. Let's talk about the defense of Horford and Porzingis against Maxey, a speedy guard. They positioned themselves a bit too high in the drop coverage, giving Maxey too much space to penetrate, relying heavily on White for defensive pursuit. In terms of transition defense, sometimes the twin towers expect the guards to help with the initial matchup, but there are often miscommunications that give opponents wide-open opportunities.

Although they adopt a conservative defensive stance, there are several possessions where they directly double-team and then recover on defense. Even when playing conservative, Holiday directly helps defend the ball handler from the weak side, allowing Porzingis to match up against the weak side player.

On the offensive end, the twin Js are still on vacation, as they have not performed well offensively. It is worth noting that their timing and screening direction with the center are not ideal, causing their offensive movements to be sluggish. Combined with their ice-cold shooting, the overall offense lacks fluidity. The same problem applies to off-ball screens, with multiple players often crowding together, failing to create enough space.

Porzingis, on the other hand, has made some good high post plays. His ability to shoot in pick-and-pop and pick-and-roll situations seems comfortable. Holiday, apart from his quick defensive hands, showcased a strong offensive push alongside Brown in the third quarter.

However, as expected, in the second quarter, Tatum and Brown took turns attacking from the low post, causing the opponents to hesitate in double-teaming due to the threat of outside shooters. Towards the end of the quarter, there was an attempt to use a small-ball lineup with Porzingis as the lone big man, pairing the twin Js with White and Holiday. This is a lineup that I believe will be used in crucial moments, but there haven't been many attempts to see how well they work together. It will require more time to observe.

- Bench Power - Please continue reading below.

Even though everyone believes that the Celtics have lost depth, our bench players should not be underestimated. Pritchard is the key to unlocking our three-point shooting, confidently taking shots even in a fast-paced game. He has also improved his ball-handling and rhythm control, showcasing his ability to change pace effectively. He has the ability to create his own shot, with several instances of isolation plays and step-back threes, reminiscent of his "Fast PP" days. In the frontcourt, Brissett and Stevens have influenced the game as expected with their tenacity. Kornet, on the other hand, seems to struggle with the fast pace, often fumbling the ball. Banton's offensive contribution is not something to expect.
