 The Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA) announced on Monday, September 4th, that there is no longer any consensus between the CTBA and the Formosa Dreamers basketball team and Lin Ping-sheng regarding the contract dispute. After the first meeting on September 4th, both sides were unable to reach an agreement, and the CTBA has decided to respect the wishes of the two teams and will not assist in further negotiations.

In regards to this case, the CTBA will continue to show respect and understanding towards any actions taken by the two teams through legal means. The CTBA also plans to establish and improve relevant systems within the domestic basketball industry in order to create a healthier basketball environment. Starting January 1st, 2024, the CTBA will implement a "sports agent system" with the hope of protecting and promoting fair transactions for the domestic basketball industry, teams, and players, and to prevent any future contract disputes that may affect the rights and interests of players and teams.
