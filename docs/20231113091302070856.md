 The Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and Hsinchu Attack Lions, Taishin War Gods, and Lin Bing-Sheng's team held a coordination meeting today. The CBA issued a statement regarding the meeting: Previously, the Hsinchu Attack Lions had issued a final ultimatum, demanding that Lin Bing-Sheng fulfill his contract on September 1st, or else they would exhaust all legal measures to prevent him from playing for any other team. However, Lin Bing-Sheng has continued to train with the Taishin War Gods, indicating that he has no intention of fulfilling his contract with the Attack Lions. As for the results of the coordination meeting, there is currently no clear outcome. After further discussions, it is likely that a second coordination meeting will take place in the near future.
