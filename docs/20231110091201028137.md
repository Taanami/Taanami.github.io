 T1202324 Season Analysis: Taiwan Beer Yongfeng Clouded Leopard Adds "War God" Little An, Record Will Skyrocket

 (Cover photo source/T1 League) Despite having the "strongest" foreign player in Taiwan history, Dwight Howard, joining the team last season, the core problem of the team was not solved, resulting in the Clouded Leopard becoming the laughingstock of the league with a dismal record of 6 wins and 24 losses.

 This year, although everyone was expecting Dwight Howard to stay, the Clouded Leopard has merged with Taiwan Beer and not only showed a different playing style in the preseason, but also greatly strengthened their local player lineup. In this season analysis, we will take a look at the Clouded Leopard's situation in the new season from the perspective of the players. Please continue reading to find out how they will soar to victory.

 To win a game, a team must have a good point guard who can control and change the game. For example, the first season's champion team's "Brickman" or the previous season's champion team's Lin Wei-han in the special attack lineup. This season, the Clouded Leopard has added a player of the same level, or even better in scoring ability, Little An, who averaged 16.8 points per game last season, ranking second among local players. His 6.3 assists per game also ranked third among all players. With an average of 6 three-point attempts per game and a shooting percentage of nearly 40%, he is a star player who can change the game. In the past two seasons, the Clouded Leopard's problem has always been the lack of a point guard who can stabilize the situation and lead the team to victory in crucial moments. Little An's addition fills these two important vacancies.

The Luxgen has never given its players a clear role and has not established a complete offensive system, and their foreign player choices did not match the team.

 In this situation, even having a point guard of Little An's caliber was not enough. However, from the preseason games, it seems that the Clouded Leopard will not face this problem. In the two games, we can see that they have a clear and simple offensive system. Of course, there may still be changes in their foreign player choices, especially Devin Williams, who did not seem to fit in with the team in the two games. But overall, the Clouded Leopard has done very well, with efficient two-man combinations, baseline cuts, and shooters lurking on the sidelines or in the corners. In addition, they have Lasan Kromah, a foreign player who can handle fast breaks and one-on-one situations.

Moreover, the team also has Lu Chieh-min, who had a three-point shooting percentage of 39% last season, and shooter Lee Chi-wei. We believe that the Clouded Leopard's game plan is feasible. Please continue reading about Little An, who has MVP-level skills, and the second overall pick, Gao Jin-wei, who is also worth watching.

 Next, let's talk about the second player worth watching, this year's second overall pick, "Little Gao" Gao Jin-wei. In the UBA, he averaged 12.8 points and 4.5 assists per game. In the World University Games, he showed his abilities and talent by making 5 three-pointers and scoring 26 points to lead the Chinese team to victory over the Chinese team. He also made the most three-pointers in the tournament, with a total of 19.

 His special ability is that he can handle the ball and attack while also being a spot-up shooter, and he has a level of maturity in ball-handling that is uncommon for players of his age. However, no matter how good he is, he also needs a veteran to lead him to the next level. With Little An as a point guard and MVP-level veteran to lead him, we believe that Gao Jin-wei will make great progress and amaze everyone with his performance.

This is a luxury that Little An did not have in his time with the Yulon Luxgen. Even though he is already 32 years old, we often see Little An playing for 40 minutes or even the entire game just to get a win. This puts a huge physical burden on him and cannot guarantee that he will have the stamina to lead the team to victory in crucial moments. With a huge upgrade to the team, the Clouded Leopard's goal for the new season is to win games. In summary, the Clouded Leopard has made great improvements this season and has players who can make Little An more comfortable. This team is also more likely to win games and make it to the playoffs, especially with the addition of Justyn Hamilton, the other foreign player this season. Although he does not have a three-point shot, his height, wingspan, and athleticism are impressive. He can drive to the basket and roll in for a layup, making him a perfect fit for the Clouded Leopard, or we could say he is a perfect fit for Little An.

 The Clouded Leopard's lineup this season is much better than last season, and they have players who can make Little An more comfortable. This lineup also increases their chances of winning games and we believe that fans are looking forward to seeing a stronger Clouded Leopard in the new season.
