When it comes to the Pelicans' X-factor, aside from the health of their star wings, Trey Murphy III and Herb Jones have shown significant growth. Murphy has seen an increase of 9 points per game, raising expectations for him to have a more important role on the offensive end next season. I have previously written an article about Trey Murphy III, and if you're interested, you can take a look. Player's Notes - More Than Just a Dunk Contest Runner-Up Trey Murphy III.

This season, Trey's numbers have steadily improved, with his overall shooting percentage increasing by nearly ten percent. It's important to remember that he is only a sophomore and his explosive performance in the dunk contest has garnered attention. He is known for being an athletic and versatile wing, but his three-point shooting percentage of 40% should not be overlooked. In fact, this season he has shot 48% from the field, 40% from three-point range, and 90% from the free-throw line, coming close to the coveted 50-40-90 club. Many consider him a 3-and-D player due to his defensive abilities, but his defense may not be as strong as expected, so I wouldn't necessarily label him as such.

Trey's offensive breakout this season was expected. In the second half of his rookie year, starting from March, he started getting around 19 minutes of playing time and scored in double digits multiple times. During this period, he had an impressive three-point shooting percentage of 43.8%. In a game against the Hornets in March, he scored 32 points, showing his willingness to take on offensive responsibilities. In a game against the Lakers, he scored 21 points in the second half, helping the team come from behind and secure a victory. In the playoffs, he maintained a three-point shooting percentage of nearly 50% in six games. Although the sample size is small, it is enough to trust in his ability to perform under pressure. His breakout has continued into his second year.

While his ball-handling skills may still need improvement, his shooting threat allows him to challenge the defense by attacking the paint whenever opponents aggressively close out on him. His long arms and legs give him an advantage, making him a formidable finisher at the rim. Additionally, his fast break threat is evident in his playtype data, with Trey's fast break efficiency surpassing 91.4% of players in the league. If we set the criteria at a minimum of three possessions, only Tyrese Maxey of the 76ers outperforms him.

He and Zion are an unstoppable combination, like a tank and a sniper rifle.

Looking at his shot distribution, it's clear that Trey has yet to showcase his mid-range offensive skills. Although the mid-range game is becoming less prevalent in today's NBA, it is still important for a player aiming to become a star to master all aspects of offensive skills. Therefore, breaking through in mid-range offense will be a significant challenge for him next season. In offseason training videos, Trey has shown awareness of his weaknesses and has been working on improving his skills. This reminds me of Brandon Ingram, who also focused on improving his finishing and ball-handling abilities during the offseason, ultimately breaking out. Trey currently has a better foundation, although his ceiling may not be as high. However, we have seen many players in recent years break through their perceived ceilings, so Trey has the potential to be the next one.

As for his defense, it must be said that Trey's current defensive abilities are at best average. His long frame limits his ability to defend in one-on-one situations, especially against pick-and-rolls. He is not a heavy-bodied player, which makes guarding both guards and heavier wings challenging for him. Currently, the Pelicans have him guard the second or third ball-handler, such as Dillon Brooks from the Grizzlies, Jalen Williams from the Thunder, and Mikal Bridges from his time with the Suns. However, his performance has been quite poor. Even when guarding players with similar body types, his performance is not satisfactory. I would even describe it as "poor." Looking at advanced stats, Trey's on-court defensive efficiency is 112.8, which is the third-worst on the team, only better than CJ McCollum and Jonas Valanciunas. After he leaves the court, the defensive efficiency improves to 107.1, with only CJ McCollum having a larger discrepancy. Additionally, opponents have a 3.1% higher field goal percentage when guarded by Trey. Whether guarding guards or forwards, his matchups have been consistently subpar. Only when the team puts him in help defense positions can his weaknesses be somewhat masked and his defensive range highlighted. So, if someone calls him a defensive lock, it is clearly misinformation. The Pelicans desperately need him to improve his defense, or else Herb Jones might get overwhelmed.
