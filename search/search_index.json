6000 degrees, and it has heated the Earth, so why is space at absolute zero?","text":"<p>The primary energy source on Earth comes from solar radiation, and the sun is able to continuously radiate energy because a controlled nuclear fusion reaction is taking place in its core. However, while the sun heats the Earth, the temperature of space between the Earth and the Sun is close to absolute zero. Why is that?</p> <p>Stellar nuclear fusion reaction To understand this, we first need to clarify how the sun generates energy. If it could be summed up in a sentence, it would be: extremes meet, it's all forced out by gravity. Why?</p> <p>The sun's mass is 330,000 times that of the Earth and accounts for 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system, making it the absolute dominant force in the solar system. Because of the sun's enormous mass, its gravitational pull is also substantial, which causes severe compression of the sun itself. As a result, the temperature of the sun's core rises sharply, reaching 15 million degrees.</p> <p>Even at this temperature, nuclear fusion reactions cannot be triggered. This is because nuclear fusion requires even more stringent conditions, at least hundreds of millions of degrees. For example, when scientists detonate a hydrogen bomb, they first detonate an atomic bomb, using the atomic bomb to provide a reaction temperature of hundreds of millions of degrees, thereby triggering a nuclear fusion reaction.</p> <p>So, what principle does the nuclear fusion in the sun's core rely on?</p> <p>Due to the extremely high temperature of the sun's core, the state of matter in the sun's core is no longer the common gas, solid, or liquid, but a plasma state. The so-called \"plasma state\" refers to when the electrons inside the atoms that make up matter obtain enough energy to become free electrons after breaking away from the nucleus. Therefore, the sun's core is more like a \"particle porridge\" mixed with various particles, filled with various atomic nuclei, electrons, and photons.</p> <p>This increases the likelihood of atomic nuclei meeting each other. However, because atomic nuclei are positively charged, according to the principle of like charges repelling each other, there is electrostatic repulsion between atomic nuclei, and fusion between atomic nuclei needs to overcome this \"repulsion\".</p> <p>In theory, the sun should not be able to undergo nuclear fusion reactions. However, in the microscopic world, there is a situation called quantum tunneling. The so-called \"quantum tunneling effect\" refers to the fact that even reactions that require energy have a certain probability of occurring in the microscopic world.</p> <p>However, the probability is extremely low, and it takes at least a billion years for a pair of atomic nuclei to fuse. Fortunately, the sun is large enough and has an extremely large number of particles, so even if the probability is very low, it can occur in front of such a huge base number of the sun. The whole process is divided into three stages, and finally, 4 hydrogen atomic nuclei fuse into 1 helium-4 atomic nucleus.</p> <p>Nuclear fusion generates outward pressure, which can counteract its own gravity, ensuring that the sun's gravity does not collapse on its own. This also forms a dynamic balance, preventing the sun from exploding all at once like a hydrogen bomb.</p> <p>There will be mass loss before and after the reaction, and this part of the mass will be released in the form of energy. In simple terms, photons and neutrinos will be produced in the core, and it takes an average of 140,000 years for photons to travel from the sun's core to the sun's surface, and then another 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth.</p> <p>So the question is, why haven't these photons heated up the cosmic space between the sun and the earth, but have baked the earth instead?</p> <p>The essence of temperature To understand this, we need to clarify the essence of temperature.</p> <p>From the perspective of the microscopic world, the essence of temperature is the intensity of particle thermal motion. This is because everything is composed of particles, but the particles are not neatly arranged together, but are in constant, chaotic motion.</p> <p>Scientists have found that if these particles move very intensely overall, the temperature reflected by the substance is high. If the particles don't move intensely overall, the reflected temperature is relatively low.</p> <p></p> <p>However, there is a prerequisite for achieving such results: a sufficient number of particles. In plain terms, to reflect a problem, there must be a sufficient number of particles in the first place. If there are no particles, we can't measure the temperature and it's hard to reflect the temperature.</p> <p>Sadly, space is really sparse. The average density of the universe is very close to 1*10^(-28) kg/cubic meter, which is about the level of one hydrogen atom per cubic meter. Therefore, when photons pass through the universe between the sun and the earth, due to the extremely low number of particles, photons cannot transfer their energy into this space. You can understand this as there are no particles present to receive these photons. Hence, it's difficult for photons to heat up the cosmic space.</p> <p>There has always been a belief that the temperature of space is absolute zero, but this idea is problematic. As mentioned above, it's actually challenging to measure the temperature of space. Moreover, the average temperature of the universe is -270.15 degrees Celsius, which is 2.7 degrees higher than absolute zero. This temperature comes from the residual heat left by the Big Bang, also known as cosmic microwave background radiation, but it's challenging to measure this temperature.</p> <p>Having understood why space doesn't get heated, we can easily understand why Earth gets heated. Earth is a celestial body with a particle heap, and its material density reaches 5507.85 kg/cubic meter, which is 31 orders of magnitude higher than the density of space. So when photons transfer to the Earth, the particles that make up the Earth can well receive these photons.</p> <p>In conclusion The biggest difference between space and Earth is material density, with the latter being 31 orders of magnitude higher than the former. For a material to be heated, it first needs a sufficiently large material density. Space, being so sparse, is hard to heat, while the Earth, with its particularly high material density, gets heated.</p>"},{"location":"20230601113201/","title":"\u6700\u72c2\uff01\u8dd1\u8d0f\u975e\u6d32\u4eba\u7684\u65e5\u672c\u516c\u52d9\u54e1","text":"<p>

He also announced on social media that he will wear the Chinese national team jersey and compete in the FIBA Basketball World Cup in August. Kyle Anderson was born in Fairview, New Jersey, USA. He was selected by the Spurs in the first round, 30th overall, in the 2014 NBA Draft and played for them for four years.</p> <p>He has played for the Spurs, Grizzlies, and Timberwolves throughout his career. Anderson is 206 cm tall and weighs 104 kg, with an impressive wingspan of 220 cm.</p> <p>In the previous season, he played for the Timberwolves in 69 games, averaging 9.4 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.9 blocks per game. He had an all-around performance with a three-point shooting percentage of 41% and a field goal percentage of 50.9%.</p> <p>In international competitions, Anderson has previously participated in the training camps for the U16 and U17 US teams but has never represented the US in games. This fits FIBA's criteria for naturalized players, giving him the opportunity to switch national teams and compete for China.</p> <p>Anderson's connection with China comes from his mother's heritage. His great-grandfather was a Chinese immigrant, giving him one-eighth Chinese ancestry.</p> <p>Five years ago, in 2018, he embarked on a journey to China with his mother to explore his roots and left the name \"Li Kai'er\" in the family genealogy. It was then that the Chinese Basketball Association actively pursued Anderson to become a naturalized player. After announcing his Chinese citizenship on the 24th, Anderson shared his journey of becoming a Chinese citizen on Weibo with the username \"Da Hammer Li Kai'er.\"</p> <p>He recalled that the root-seeking trip in 2018 was very important to him as it showed him where his roots lie and how deep they go. He also expressed pride and honor in having his name written in the Li family genealogy.</p> <p>He also announced on social media that he will represent the Chinese national team in the upcoming FIBA Basketball World Cup in August. The post shared by FIBA Basketball World Cup (@fibawc) about Anderson becoming Li Kai'er, China's first naturalized basketball player, has been widely commented on. It is seen as not only a change in China's basketball style but also an accelerator for the transformation of Chinese basketball.</p> <p>Sports commentator Li Yishen believes that Anderson has a well-rounded playing style, with the ability to handle the ball, control the game, and pass. He has a high basketball IQ and can activate China's interior offense and defense with his height and playmaking abilities.</p> <p>Especially since China lacks power and restraining ability in the interior, Anderson's addition can help the tall players inside, create space, organize passes, and create scoring opportunities. However, Anderson's unique playing style and slow pace may require time to integrate into China's playing system. In the end, Li Yishen believes that Anderson is not the solution for the Chinese men's basketball team. Although he is unique, he is not an NBA superstar who can dominate Asian opponents with his ball handling and individual skills. China needs top-notch coaches and improvements in player skills, physical fitness, and training systems.</p>"},{"location":"20230818160459469560/","title":"NBA Eastern Conference Finals: Celtics' miraculous comeback in Game 6 ties series","text":"<p>The Boston Celtics, who were down 0-3 in the Eastern Conference Finals, managed to secure a narrow 104-103 victory against the Miami Heat in Game 6 on September 28    NBA Eastern Conference Finals: Celtics' miraculous comeback in Game 6 ties series</p> <p>The Boston Celtics, who were down 0-3 in the Eastern Conference Finals, managed to secure a narrow 104-103 victory against the Miami Heat in Game 6 on September 28.

Brown has secured a 5-year, $304 million supermax contract extension, setting a new record for the highest salary in NBA history. Last season, Brown achieved career-high averages of 26.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game. He played a crucial role in leading the Celtics to the Eastern Conference Finals and was selected to the NBA All-Star Game for the first time. As a result, he earned the opportunity to sign a 5-year max contract extension with the Celtics.</p> <p>According to reports from Reuters, Brown was selected by the Celtics as the third overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. He has been selected to the NBA All-Star Game twice and will earn $28.5 million in the upcoming season.

This defeat could potentially lead to a rebuild of the Warriors' roster in the upcoming 2024 season.</p> <p>Steve Kerr, who is 57 years old, has been coaching the Warriors since the 2014-15 season. Prior to this series against the Lakers, the Warriors had a perfect 19-0 record against Western Conference teams in the playoffs. This means that whenever the Warriors made it to the postseason, they would always reach the NBA Finals and have won the championship four times. </p> <p>Although the Warriors finished the regular season in 6th place, avoiding the play-in tournament, they had a tough first-round series against the Sacramento Kings, a team with little playoff experience. They only managed to advance after a hard-fought Game 7. Looking at the Warriors' core rotation, it is unlikely that they would trade their star player Stephen Curry, whose contract runs until 2026. However, Klay Thompson, one of the \"Splash Brothers,\" is likely to be a target for trade by the team.</p> <p>According to a report from US sports media outlet \"Legion Hoops,\" Thompson will be in the final year of his contract next year, earning a salary of up to $43.21 million (approximately 1.34 billion New Taiwan dollars). Although the Warriors have the option to extend his contract, there have been rumors that the team wants the 33-year-old Thompson to take a pay cut for the extension.</p> <p>Furthermore, according to a report from US sports news website \"The Athletic,\" Draymond Green has a player option for the next season, but he must decide whether to exercise it by June 30, 2023. Although the Warriors are interested in re-signing him, it is not guaranteed that they would offer him a maximum contract. If Green becomes a free agent, there are likely to be many teams interested in acquiring him.</p> <p>In addition to the three main starters, Jonathan Kuminga, who only played an average of 6.3 minutes per game in the series against the Lakers, has expressed some dissatisfaction. His agent revealed to \"The Athletic\" that if Kuminga is not included in the Warriors' future plans, he hopes to be traded to a team that will give him more opportunities.</p> <p>In the Western Conference playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the defending champions Golden State Warriors with a final score of 122-101. The Lakers will now face the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers had a 3-2 advantage going into the game and outperformed the Warriors in various aspects. LeBron James had 30 points, 9 rebounds, and 9 assists, while Anthony Davis contributed 17 points and 20 rebounds. Austin Reaves made 4 out of 5 three-pointers, scoring a total of 23 points for the Lakers. On the Warriors' side, despite Stephen Curry's game-high 32 points and Andrew Wiggins playing despite a rib injury, Klay Thompson struggled, and the team's three-point shooting was inefficient, making only 13 out of 48 attempts. The Lakers led by 5 points at the end of the first quarter and extended their lead to 10 points by halftime. In the second half, the Lakers continued to dominate, and the Warriors couldn't catch up. The Lakers secured a 14-point lead going into the fourth quarter and maintained their advantage until the end of the game.</p> <p>As the 7th seed in the Western Conference, the Lakers defeated the 2nd seed Memphis Grizzlies in the first round and eliminated the 6th seed Warriors in the second round.

The ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup, co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia, will also kick off in New Zealand on July 20.</p> <p>Pip Meo, a former member of the New Zealand national team and a driving force behind the agreement, pointed out that the fight for pay equality is not just about salaries, but about the value of women's sports and sending positive messages to generations of young girls who wear soccer shoes.</p> <p>Meo added, \"We can't celebrate yet because we still have to see how this deal plays out, and we've only received what we should have gotten.\"</p> <p>The Washington Post reported that while New Zealand's global image has been improving, their soccer industry has long had issues with gender pay disparities and unequal distribution of resources. Most of New Zealand's soccer clubs are amateur clubs run by volunteers, and the maximum salary a player can receive is regulated by the national soccer federation at around $94 per week. However, whether the clubs will distribute salaries equally has not received much attention from the government. In the New Zealand soccer scene, women receive much lower salaries, fewer training opportunities, and less access to facilities and coaching staff compared to men. Typically, women's teams have only one coach while men's teams have several.</p> <p>Last year, members of the Manukau United soccer team in New Zealand launched a campaign for equal pay and resources for men and women, but it ended in failure. Maia Jackman, a team member, stated, \"Many female players from various teams would stand up for themselves, but they would face setbacks and eventually give up. However, the people at Western Springs are different. They have consistently stood by their beliefs and never backed down.\"</p> <p>Meo and Jackman joined the Western Springs Association, where almost all board members are male, in an attempt to achieve gender equality in the soccer world once again in 2023.</p> <p>After two months of struggle, Meo and Jackman, along with two pro bono lawyers, reached an agreement with the club's management through a 12-hour marathon mediation session and the threat of a strike, achieving gender equality.</p> <p>The club also issued a statement acknowledging past flaws and offering apologies.</p> <p>Regarding the successful negotiation, Meo responded that the new agreement has not yet been officially implemented, so they cannot be too happy too soon, while Jackman stated, \"Ultimately, we just want to play football without any restrictions or concerns.\"</p> <p>Jackman said her focus will now be on the World Cup, hoping that through this event, the world can see the charm of women's soccer. According to reports from CBS and Lexology, gender pay inequality is prevalent in many sports worldwide. Taking basketball as an example, the average annual income for male NBA players is $5.3 million, with even higher earnings for star players like Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, who earned $45.7 million and $42 million in annual salaries last year, respectively.</p> <p>In comparison, the average annual income for female WNBA players is only $130,000, and the highest-earning player in the league makes only $230,000 per year.</p> <p>However, the reports also point out that the main reason for the large wage gap between men and women in sports is the lower popularity and resulting revenue and ticket sales in women's sports, which naturally leads to lower salaries.</p> <p>The NBA generated approximately $10 billion in revenue last season, while the WNBA only had $60 million. However, when focusing on American football, the U.S. women's soccer team has generated more revenue and attracted more viewers than the men's team since 2019, yet their income and prize money for winning were still lower than their male counterparts until last year.</p> <p>According to Lexology, the most effective way to promote gender equality in sports is to increase the promotion of women's sports. Encouraging media and advertising to highlight female athletes and encouraging businesses to invest in women's sports and athletes through commercial partnerships and sponsorships will garner more attention for female athletes, generate more ticket sales, and contribute to achieving gender pay equality.</p>"},{"location":"20230818160641775980/","title":"The NBA has renamed the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, which recognizes the player with the most outstanding performance in the regular season, as the Michael Jordan Trophy, paying tribute to one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history","text":"<p>The NBA has renamed the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, which recognizes the player with the most outstanding performance in the regular season, as the Michael Jordan Trophy, paying tribute to one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history.

Lin, who is currently in the United States, posted a photoshopped image of himself wearing the number 7 jersey on social media with the caption \"I'm here, Kaohsiung.\" Rumors of Lin joining the Taiwanese professional basketball league had been circulating since the end of last year, but the team had not confirmed until now. The announcement by P. LEAGUE+ Kaohsiung Steel on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year came as a shock to the Taiwanese basketball scene.</p> <p>The 2022-23 season of the Taiwanese professional basketball league has been full of surprises. The Taoyuan Yongfeng Clouded Leopards, a team from the neighboring T1 League, first signed former NBA All-Star Dwight Howard. Now, PLG has recruited the highly popular Lin, creating a situation where two big stars will face off in Taiwan. Rumors of Lin returning to play in Taiwan had been brewing since last year, but at the time, he was still playing for the Guangzhou Loong Lions in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). It wasn't until the end of last year that he announced his decision to leave the CBA and return to Taiwan.</p> <p>Since Lin's younger brother, Lin Shu-wei, currently plays for the New Taipei Kings, a team ranked at the top of the PLG, Jeremy had expressed his desire to have the opportunity to play alongside his brother during his professional career. Although they won't be playing on the same team, the brothers will soon have the chance to compete against each other in the same league, taking a big step towards their \"reunion.\"</p> <p>In addition to posting a photo of himself wearing the Steel's jersey on social media, Lin wrote, \"Kaohsiung, I'm here.\" Many fans have left supportive comments, with one fan writing, \"Welcome to Kaohsiung, the people of Kaohsiung will support you to the end.\" Another fan wrote, \"Taiwan welcomes you back to play basketball,\" showing their excitement and support for Lin's return.</p> <p>P. LEAGUE+ Kaohsiung Steel officially announced the signing of Taiwanese basketball star Jeremy Lin. Recognizing the long-standing imbalance in Taiwanese basketball between the north and south, Lin supports the Steel's \"Great Southern Plan\" and hopes to contribute to the team's efforts.</p> <p>Lin, who previously sparked \"Linsanity\" in the NBA, has played in top professional leagues such as the NBA and CBA for many years. He ended his contract with the CBA's Beijing Ducks and decided to return to his homeland of Taiwan after the Lunar New Year holiday. Lin's NBA journey was not without challenges. Although he signed contracts with the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, he didn't receive much playing time. He had to go back and forth between the NBA and development leagues. It wasn't until 2012, when he joined the New York Knicks, that he seized the opportunity to score 25 points off the bench, along with 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals, leading the team to a victory and capturing the attention of fans. In subsequent games, Lin continued to deliver impressive performances, achieving double-double stats against star guards like John Wall and scoring a career-high 38 points against the late Kobe Bryant. The \"Linsanity\" phenomenon became a hot topic in the global basketball community, and Lin even graced the cover of TIME magazine and was selected as one of TIME 100's most influential people in 2012.</p> <p>After nearly 10 years of playing in the NBA, Lin won an NBA championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019 before joining the CBA's Beijing Ducks, where he averaged 22.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. Wherever Lin went, the arenas were filled to capacity, and he became the crowd favorite. He terminated his contract with the Beijing Ducks at the end of last year and joined the Kaohsiung Steel after the Lunar New Year holiday. The Kaohsiung Steel team stated in a press release that the \"Linsanity\" phenomenon was not a coincidence. In addition to Lin's high self-discipline and refusal to give up, he was always ready to seize opportunities. When the New York Knicks were in a losing streak, Lin took advantage of the opportunity and led the team to overcome adversity, achieving a winning streak and making it to the playoffs, proving his worth. The Steel team's current situation is similar, and Lin's arrival is expected to fill the team's lack of experience in the backcourt. His addition will not only bring substantial strength to the Steel but also provide more opportunities for the team's promising young guards Chen Yu-wei and Wang Lu-xiang to grow. </p> <p>As the only team in southern Taiwan in P. LEAGUE+, the Kaohsiung Steel joined the league last year and has been actively promoting the \"Great Southern Plan\" to gradually address the resource imbalance in Taiwanese basketball between the north and south. The aim is to enable more young players in the south to stay and play in their hometowns. With Lin's joining and support, the Steel's \"Great Southern Plan\" will take a big step forward.</p> <p>A devout Christian, Jeremy Lin has had a longstanding connection with the Fengshan Gymnasium, the home arena of the Kaohsiung Steel. In 2016, he shared his life experiences and testimony under the theme \"Unceasing Breakthrough\" with nearly 5,000 churchgoers and fans, sharing the strength his faith has given him. After becoming an NBA player, he faced many challenges and discrimination, but he adjusted his pace, bravely embraced challenges, and overcame them.</p> <p>According to the team's general manager, Gao Jing-yan, Lin's decision to join the team was driven by his sense of responsibility and mission, both for himself and for the overall development of basketball. He was well aware that basketball development in Taiwan has been concentrated in the north, with the south relatively less vibrant. He hopes that his joining the team can change the viewing culture of basketball fans in southern Taiwan and bring more resources and change to the southern market.</p> <p>Jeremy Lin's basketball career has always been about defying the impossible. When he went undrafted and faced skepticism as a Chinese-American, he still successfully entered the NBA and made a name for himself. Now, as he chooses to join the Kaohsiung Steel, fans are eagerly anticipating whether he can replicate the success of \"Linsanity\" in the NBA and transform himself into the team's savior.</p>"},{"location":"20230818161058997757/","title":"Article: In the first game of the Western Conference first round between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies, Grizzlies guard Ja Morant painfully lay on the court after a drive and went straight to the locker room due to a hand injury, ending his battle in that game","text":"<p>Article: In the first game of the Western Conference first round between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies, Grizzlies guard Ja Morant painfully lay on the court after a drive and went straight to the locker room due to a hand injury, ending his battle in that game. Subsequently, the Los Angeles Lakers turned a closely contested game into an easy away victory.</p> <p>Soon after, a similar scene unfolded in Milwaukee, as Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo lay on the court in pain, clutching his back.</p> <p>Without Antetokounmpo, the Bucks also lost their chance to win the first game of the series. Morant and Antetokounmpo, the two star players of their respective teams, not only suffered injuries in the playoffs but also share a commonality in the way they got injured.</p> <p>Both Morant and Antetokounmpo fell hard after driving to the basket, with defenders attempting to create offensive fouls.</p> <p>Anthony Davis successfully blocked Morant, while Kevin Love was called for a foul, sending Antetokounmpo to the free-throw line. With star players spending less and less time on the court, the league needs to start considering how to increase their playing time. Besides raising the threshold for awards, another issue worth discussing is whether the penalties after fouls are sufficient to protect players from unnecessary injuries caused by dangerous landings.</p> <p>Although Morant and Antetokounmpo were absent in the following second game, neither suffered career-ending injuries and both returned to play in their respective series. However, we have seen many promising young stars whose careers were cut short due to injuries, so how to prevent the next player with a similar experience has become a primary concern.</p> <p>The most extreme possibility is to prohibit any help defender from creating offensive fouls, an idea proposed by Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, in his personal blog in 2004.</p> <p>Cuban acknowledged that the Mavericks did a great job of creating offensive fouls, and the players' willingness to endure physical pain for defensive purposes is commendable, but he believes this rule is \"terrible\" for the NBA.</p> <p>He mentioned in the article, \"This not only increases the risk of injury for both players, but also weakens some of the most exciting and watchable performances in basketball. Players no longer focus on making spectacular, incredible shots near the basket, but instead lower their heads and look at the ground to see if someone will try to obstruct them by creating offensive fouls.\" It is worth noting that this proposal would not reduce the blocks made by primary defenders to prevent players like Antetokounmpo from attacking the basket.</p> <p>According to ESPN Stats &amp; Info, he committed 233 offensive fouls in the past 10 seasons while driving to the basket, and this only happened when facing opponents who wanted to stop him at the frontline.</p> <p>Furthermore, even if players can knock down help defenders without being called for traveling, NBA rules also prohibit players from creating \"non-basketball contact\" beyond the concept of the body cylinder, meaning that intentional unnecessary pushing actions against help defenders are not allowed. However, in this era where offensive efficiency is higher than ever, such changes seem to favor the offensive side too much. When Cuban proposed this in 2004, offensive efficiency was at its lowest, so they had to find a way to give offensive players an advantage. The league's average offensive efficiency in the 2003-04 season was 101.4 points per 100 possessions.</p> <p>This season, that number has risen to 114.1. It is worth praising that long before Morant was born, the NBA already had a rule aimed at preventing player injuries, known as the \"restricted area\" under the basket, and since the 1997-98 season, the restricted area has been expanded to its current size (four feet in diameter).</p> <p>The NBA was the first league to introduce the restricted area, and later the NCAA and FIBA also adopted this rule. However, since this rule was implemented 26 years ago, the game has undergone significant changes.</p> <p>Back then, the offensive range was much smaller than it is now. In the 1997-98 season, only 16% of shots came from three-pointers, while this season, the proportion of three-point attempts has reached 39%. As long-distance three-pointers become more popular, the average shooting distance also continues to increase.</p> <p>According to ESPN's statistics, in the 1997-98 season, the average distance of jump shots outside the paint was 18.4 feet (excluding logo shots), while this season, the average shooting distance outside the paint is 22.8 feet, an increase of over 4 feet.</p> <p>Expanding the offensive space requires defenders to cover more area, which means they are more likely to move actively to legal defensive positions near the offensive player when they take off from outside the paint. According to the rules, such \"delayed standing\" defensive actions are prohibited. Defenders attempting to obstruct offensive players by creating offensive fouls are not allowed to \"move into the path of the offensive player when the offensive player begins his upward motion.\"</p> <p>In other words, as long as the offensive player takes off to attack the basket after receiving the ball, defenders cannot attempt to step into a position outside the restricted area to create offensive fouls at that moment. This is the reason why Love's defense against Antetokounmpo was called a foul. However, in reality, it is difficult for referees to simultaneously determine the position of the defender and the timing of the offensive player's takeoff. Therefore, whether the defender is inside the restricted area often becomes the primary criterion for distinguishing between blocking fouls and charging fouls, which is why Cuban advocates increasing the radius of the restricted area to five feet.</p> <p>This proposal is not made rashly. As early as 2006, Cuban publicly suggested expanding the restricted area and hoped it would \"cover the entire paint.\"</p> <p>If the restricted area is larger, cases like Morant's injury would be considered fouls on Davis, so Davis would not attempt to create offensive fouls in the first place.</p> <p>Instead, Davis might prepare to block Morant's shot, which he is good at. He contributed a total of seven blocks on Sunday, repeatedly thwarting the Grizzlies' attacks.</p>"},{"location":"20230818161143840136/","title":"NBA star Carmelo Anthony, also known as \"Melo,\" announced his retirement from basketball in a heartfelt video on Twitter yesterday","text":"<p>NBA star Carmelo Anthony, also known as \"Melo,\" announced his retirement from basketball in a heartfelt video on Twitter yesterday. After 19 seasons, Anthony, who will turn 39 next week, expressed his gratitude and said, \"The time has come for me to say goodbye.\" Throughout his career, Anthony played for the Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Los Angeles Lakers, accumulating a total of 28,289 points and ranking 9th on the NBA's all-time scoring list. He was a 10-time NBA All-Star and a 6-time All-NBA selection. Thank you, Carmelo! \ud83d\udc4f</p> <p>As one of the NBA's 75 greatest players and ranking 9th on the all-time scoring list, Carmelo Anthony, known as \"Melo,\" announced his retirement in a sentimental manner. Having not appeared in the NBA for over a year, he bid farewell to the court with the regret of never winning a championship. Anthony emotionally announced his retirement in a video on Twitter, saying, \"For me, the time to say goodbye has come. Basketball has given me goals and made me proud.\" His last appearance in the NBA was during the 2021-22 season with the Los Angeles Lakers, and he did not receive any offers for this season (2022-23), resulting in no playing records.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Anthony has already achieved great accomplishments. He was selected as one of the NBA's 75 greatest players, and at almost 39 years old, he has been selected as an All-Star player 10 times. Throughout his 19 seasons, he played for the Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Oklahoma City Thunder, Houston Rockets, Portland Trail Blazers, and Lakers, accumulating a total of 28,289 points (averaging 22.5 points per game) and ranking 9th on the NBA's all-time scoring list. Known for his scoring abilities and being dubbed the \"offensive maestro,\" he has had numerous career highlights, with the exception of an NBA championship ring. The closest he came was leading the Nuggets to the Western Conference Finals in 2009, only to be defeated by the eventual champions, the Lakers.</p> <p>However, Anthony has had a brilliant record representing the United States in Olympic basketball. He won gold medals in 2008, 2012, and 2016, and in total, he played in 31 Olympic games, the most by any American male player.</p> <p>Selected as the third overall pick by the Nuggets in the highly regarded 2003 NBA Draft, Anthony was part of a draft class that included top pick LeBron James, fourth pick Chris Bosh, and fifth pick Dwyane Wade, among other notable players.</p> <p>Among these four players, Anthony is the only one who did not win an NBA championship. His golden era came during his time with the Nuggets and Knicks, but his emphasis on offense over defense prevented him from leading his teams to the expected results. As the years took a toll and injuries plagued him, his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game starting from the 2017-18 season when he joined the Thunder, breaking his streak of 14 consecutive seasons with over 20 points per game.</p> <p>Since then, his performance declined, and he spent his last season with the Lakers, averaging a career-low 13.3 points per game.</p> <p>On October 24, 2021, in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony surpassed Moses Malone on the all-time scoring list, moving up to 9th place.</p> <p>After retirement, Anthony will focus on his son, Kiyan.

Fortunately, he was quickly taken to the hospital and is now out of the intensive care unit.</p> <p>However, this collapse may undermine all the efforts he has made so far. As LeBron's son, Bronny has had to face more attention and pressure than the average \"basketball second generation\". After all, he is not just a player's son, but the son of a legend who has a significant position in the entire NBA. Naturally, his basketball talent would be scrutinized more closely. However, compared to his father's dominance in high school, Bronny's leadership skills are clearly not as remarkable as LeBron's. Although he still possesses good natural abilities, he has not demonstrated the same level of dominance in high school basketball as his father did, and at one point, he was even considered to be riding on his father's coattails. Nevertheless, despite the unfavorable criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continued to improve his skills. In his senior season, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, earning a spot on the McDonald's All-American High School team. He was given the title of a five-star high school player by some basketball media outlets and received basketball scholarships from some top NCAA Division I schools.</p> <p>These achievements have significantly raised Bronny's draft prospects, going from a possible undrafted player to potentially impacting the first round or even the lottery.</p> <p>Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father LeBron's reputation. LeBron himself has stated that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, there is a high chance that he will join his son's team and play together. This \"son-picking-father\" operation undoubtedly has an impact on Bronny's market value, but we must not overlook Bronny's own efforts.</p> <p>Ultimately, he chose to attend the University of Southern California (USC) and plans to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. Prior to enrollment, he posted on his social media that he wants those who doubt him to take notice.</p> <p>However, the heart problem that has emerged before the start of the new college season casts a shadow over his future. Bronny's case, hindered by heart problems on the path to the NBA, reminds me of another \"basketball second generation,\" Shaquille O'Neal's son, Shareef O'Neal.</p> <p>During high school, Shareef did achieve some notable results and was regarded as a four-star high school player by sports media. He also planned to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, he was diagnosed with a heart abnormality that posed a high risk to his life and required urgent surgery.</p> <p>Post-surgery rest and rehabilitation forced Shareef to be absent from high-intensity games for a whole 11 months, which was detrimental to a rising player. The golden development period was wasted, and his skills and competitiveness may have fallen far behind. In addition, with Shareef's condition, he was already not dominant in the more intense NCAA. Coaches at the university, fearing a relapse and considering performance, did not give Shareef much time, leading to a significant decline in his college performance. Eventually, he faced the fate of going undrafted in the NBA. \"I always told Shareef that he would never be the next me. I want him to play his own game, his own style,\" Shaquille said. \"Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the name O'Neal, but he still needs to create his own path. At that time, I had the pressure to succeed because I wanted to improve my life. But Shareef didn't, so I hope he can find his own goals and strive for them.\" Currently, Shareef is still developing in the league, waiting for an opportunity. Although he only averaged 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the last season, overcoming the shadow of his heart problem is a major breakthrough. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be confined by his father's achievements and reputation but to bravely pursue the path he chooses. LeBron most likely sees Bronny in the same way, as his love for his child will not be affected by his draft position. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by injuries and will establish his own value in the new season.</p> <p>This article is authorized by the author, originally published here.

After retiring in 2017, he became an NBA commentator for TNT.</p> <p>However, Davis is not only a basketball player but also a low-profile top entrepreneur. During his playing career, he signed six contracts and earned a total salary of approximately $147 million. However, he didn't rely solely on his salary to make money.</p> <p>Currently, Davis is the founder of several companies spanning various industries. These include the sports content platform Sports Lifestyle in Culture (SLiC) and the multimedia company UWish.</p> <p>In 2020, when the Taiwan professional basketball league P. LEAGUE+ was established, CEO Chen Chien-chou publicly announced that Baron Davis, under the connection of Silicon Valley Taiwan Help, became one of the shareholders, including New Taipei Kings CEO Chen Hsin-sheng.</p> <p>Davis is also one of the shareholders of the East Asia Super League (EASL). The East Super League will start a brand-new home-and-away match system in 2023, focusing on developing content and videos to expand basketball's influence in Asia. Davis represents the early investors who enjoy the benefits. What's more important is that he brings his precise vision from the basketball court into the business world.</p> <p>His first investment was buying shares in Vitaminwater. In 2007, Coca-Cola announced the acquisition of Vitaminwater for $4.1 billion, and Davis received a substantial return. Following that, Davis became an angel investor for the online membership-based retailer Thrive Market in 2014. Thrive Market experienced explosive growth during the pandemic, showcasing Davis's successful investment insight once again. In 2016, Davis participated in the Series A investment of the flower delivery company Bloomthat, which far exceeded its valuation at the time.</p> <p>Due to his precise vision and diligent research, Davis's main investment field leans towards early-stage investments. Besides profitability, he hopes to have a positive impact on society and support minority entrepreneurship.</p> <p>For example, in 2021, he invested in the women's medical cannabis care brand House of Wise.</p> <p>\"I like investing in startups because these companies have the potential to become changemakers for the next generation, moving us towards a better direction,\" Davis said. \"By investing, I become a changemaker and help businesses have a greater impact. I've experienced various situations on the court, from strong teams to underdogs, being upset or defeating strong teams. So I understand the ups and downs. Now, as a serial entrepreneur, I understand the passion, energy, determination, and risk-taking required by startups. I can discuss different scenarios and coping strategies with these entrepreneurs. Being bold and detail-oriented is my advantage.\"</p> <p>Although Davis's talent as a player may not be considered top-notch, he has a knack for investment and accumulating wealth. At the age of 43, Davis can be called a pioneer in athlete entrepreneurship. His earnings and endorsements during his playing career were not substantial. However, he paved another path through research, investment, and entrepreneurship.</p> <p>Davis is perhaps one of the few retired players who became busier after retirement, with a busy schedule and budget every season. \"In a season, I study about 25-30 companies and invest in five of them,\" Davis said. One of the venture capital firms he owns, Business Inside The Game, primarily invests in African Americans, women, Middle Eastern or Indian descent, and the LGBTQ+ community. \"I hope to empower them and use investment to amplify the ideas and willpower of these minority groups for the majority to understand, enabling cultural co-prosperity.\" He also founded the content brand company Black Santa, creating cross-cultural animated characters and launching exclusive content and merchandise to achieve both profitability and public welfare goals. \"I want to present stories of heroes and cartoon characters to African Americans and all ethnic groups, allowing people of all skin colors to identify with, unite, and be entertained.\" Besides socially impactful investments, Davis has also been involved in some major commercial mergers or transactions. In 2020, when adidas intended to sell Reebok, Davis and a group of investors led by rapper Master P made a bid. In addition to mature business models, Davis is also very willing to try emerging and high-risk investments, such as the metaverse, Web3.0, cryptocurrency blockchain games, and NFTs. Black Santa released a charitable NFT during Christmas 2021, which sold out in 14 minutes. \"When facing such new technologies and fields, don't be overwhelmed, but try to understand and participate. Technology is just a tool; how to use it is the key,\" Davis said. He believes that Web3.0 and the development of cryptocurrency are well-suited for professional athletes who already have a voice and creators who are creative but not fond of commercial aspects. \"This is a brand-new opportunity that everyone can participate in.\" In recent years, Davis has been involved in content platforms with Web3.0 characteristics, including Overtime and Fireside. Davis believes that NBA players have their own voice and influence. With his star status, he can build his own brand and earn wealth and fame like other internet celebrities. However, he doesn't like doing that. \"I prefer to help and give back. That's the true value for me,\" said former NBA player Brandon Jennings, who regards Davis as the godfather of Los Angeles basketball. \"Besides being good at basketball, he often comes back to the streets to take care of us. He has always been giving back, especially to his hometown. You can call BD anytime, and he will answer the phone.\" Davis's investment enlightenment stems from wanting to break free from the exploitation of the professional basketball industry. \"I felt like I was being 'robbed.' When I was a rookie, I had no concept, so I needed agents and business managers to assist me. But after my three-year contract ended, I decided to do it myself.\" Davis not only broke the mold by not hiring agents but also started thinking about how to invest in himself. He decided to negotiate contracts and build a team to handle commercial activities. \"I'm not afraid to break with tradition. I'm very willing to try and break through the status quo.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230818161414015006/","title":"38-year-old Lakers star LeBron James becomes the first player in NBA history to average 28","text":"<p>38-year-old Lakers star LeBron James becomes the first player in NBA history to average 28.9 points in his 20th season.</p> <p>The NBA playoffs will begin today (12th), marking the completion of LeBron James' 20th regular season. According to statistics, James averaged 28.9 points this season, the highest among players who have completed 20 seasons in the league.</p> <p>Despite only playing in 55 games this season due to injuries, James still leads the team with an average of 28.9 points. If it weren't for his limited playing time, the 38-year-old James could have ranked 7th in the league's scoring list. On January 31st, James recorded 28 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds, leading the team to victory with an excellent triple-double performance.</p> <p>In NBA history, there are a total of 11 players who have completed at least 20 seasons, including James and the recently retired Heat spiritual leader, 42-year-old Haslem (Udonis Haslem). However, only James can perform like a young player.

The third place is Dirk Nowitzki in the 2017-18 season, averaging 12 points. James graduated from high school in 2003 and joined the Cleveland Cavaliers as the first overall pick that year.</p> <p>Since 2006, the NBA has banned high school students from joining the league directly after graduation. For James, playing one year ahead gave him an advantage.</p> <p>According to ESPN, James mentioned in an interview that he owes his ability to play 20 seasons and maintain a high level of performance to his personal trainer, Mike Mancias.</p> <p>James said, \"Without him, it would be impossible for me to perform at this level. He plays a crucial role in my game and my performance. I could play 7 to 12 seasons on my own, but 20 seasons without him would be impossible.\"</p> <p>Mancias was hired as the assistant strength and conditioning trainer for the Cavaliers in the 2002 season and developed a good working relationship with James, who joined the team the following year.

Why? Mainly because the past few contests have been quite lackluster.</p> <p>But to be honest, it's not entirely their fault. I often feel that after the classic showdown between Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine in 2016, the audience's taste has become more refined. If there are no more creative dunks, explosive dunk tension, or elegant aerial displays, naturally, people will find it boring.</p> <p>However, these moves require exceptional talent (jumping ability, hang time) to execute. Even if you have the talent, you still need to come up with innovative ideas to overcome the high wall of dunk contest viewership.</p> <p>But Mac McClung, a young white guard who came from the development league, has shattered everyone's expectations.</p> <p>\"He deserves to be in the NBA.\" \"Although he's a bit small, this kid can really jump.\" \"I believe Mac McClung won't disappoint in the dunk contest.\" \"He might even become the first non-NBA player to win the dunk contest.\"</p> <p>These are the appreciative comments from basketball analyst Shaquille O'Neal. So who is this Mac McClung? Mac McClung has been a talented athlete since he was young. Despite being only 188 centimeters tall, his explosive athleticism sets him apart from his peers. He was the absolute leader of his high school basketball team and even broke the school's scoring record.</p> <p>The previous record holder was none other than the famous former NBA star Allen Iverson. \"He's been really good to me, a great mentor.\" \"He taught me a lot of things that will be helpful for my future.\" McClung's impressive performances caught Iverson's attention, and he even invited McClung to participate in his own classic game. During the game, McClung's dunks left a deep impression on Iverson, and they had a meaningful conversation afterwards, according to McClung's recollection.</p> <p>It is his outstanding offensive abilities that attracted the attention of many colleges, and he ultimately chose to attend Georgetown University, just like Iverson. However, the transition from high school to college intensified the competition, and McClung's offensive skills were not as sharp as they were in high school. His shooting accuracy also suffered. Even after transferring to a new environment after two years, things didn't improve. After all, being too small in stature, it's hard to survive in college basketball without elite ball handling and shooting skills.</p> <p>Yes! At this level, being elite is not enough. Without surpassing the limitations of height, it's really difficult to thrive on the college court, let alone the NBA.</p> <p>Therefore, after spending three years in college and realizing that his draft prospects weren't changing much, McClung decided to enter the draft and pursue his dream.</p> <p>Unlike in a passionate comic, he went undrafted. In the 2021 draft, no team was willing to give him a chance. But this didn't extinguish McClung's dream of playing in the NBA. He immediately sought opportunities in the development league and had stints with the Lakers, Bulls, and Warriors. This year, he signed a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers but mostly spent his time honing his skills in the development league. \"I feel like I'm a bit sloppy on the defensive end.\" \"I need to find ways to improve myself in every game.\" \"I think I do pretty well in lob passes.\" \"But in other types of passes, I can definitely do better.\"</p> <p>In development league games, McClung worked hard to refine his skills. When he was released by the Warriors last season, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr earnestly told him that as a player of his height, he needs to improve his passing skills, in addition to scoring. With McClung's efforts to improve, he even won the G League's Rookie of the Year award last season. \"If it happens, it would be amazing!\" \"It means I've earned recognition from the NBA!\" In fact, McClung is like a video game character who maximizes all his points in athleticism. His flexibility is astonishing, and he often uploads videos of himself dunking on his personal social media platforms, gaining more fans than some NBA players. He didn't stop showcasing his explosive dunks in the development league. On the contrary, many fans eagerly await his breathtaking dunks every night. It is this high popularity that caught the attention of the league and allowed him to participate in this year's dunk contest. \"I'm lucky and grateful that the NBA gave me this opportunity.\"</p> <p>In his first dunk, McClung flew over two people, tapped the ball off the backboard, and then reverse dunked it, displaying both difficulty and creativity, earning him a perfect score of 50. In his second dunk, McClung soared into the air, twisted his body, and threw down a dunk while turning around. One judge even raised a 50-point card, but in the final scoring, due to one judge giving him only 49 points, McClung's score was 49.8. However, it was enough for him to advance to the final.</p> <p>In his third dunk, McClung flew over one person, executed two mid-air spins, and finished with a reverse dunk, earning a perfect score of 50 without any controversy. For his final dunk, McClung put on his high school jersey, took off, and rotated nearly 540 degrees in the air before slamming the ball into the hoop. After landing, he imitated the famous gesture of dunker Vince Carter in the dunk contest and said, \"It's over.\" This dunk received unanimous applause from the crowd, and McClung won the dunk contest championship.</p> <p>\"If you guys will have me, I'll come back.\" After the game, McClung said in an interview that if he's still in the league next year, he would definitely be willing to defend his title.</p> <p>Perhaps he also knows that he still has many shortcomings to overcome if he wants to establish himself in the league. After all, there are many players who have won the dunk contest but lost their place in the NBA.</p> <p>\"I've always wanted to see things I've never seen before.\" \"I hope I can achieve that through my dunks.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230818161534369236/","title":"Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic wrote NBA history by becoming the first player ever to achieve 250 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in the first five games of a season","text":"<p>Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic wrote NBA history by becoming the first player ever to achieve 250 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in the first five games of a season.

The top three picks had their own unique characteristics. As expected, \"French Monster\" Victor Wembanyama became the first overall pick and joined the San Antonio Spurs. Standing at 7 feet 5 inches (226 cm) with an 8-foot wingspan (243 cm), Wembanyama's physical attributes have attracted attention. Not only does he possess the shooting touch of a guard, but he also has the mobility of a forward. Wembanyama has been considered the top choice for the first overall pick for the past five months.</p> <p>Wembanyama is now the third player in Spurs history to be selected as the first overall pick, following David Robinson in 1987 and Tim Duncan in 1997. Both of these great centers helped the Spurs win NBA championships.</p> <p>Now, Wembanyama carries the weight of this responsibility. The Spurs have won the NBA championship five times in their history, with the most recent one being in the 2013-14 season. It is also because of Wembanyama that the Spurs have decided to extend the contract of the legendary coach Gregg Popovich for three more years. They hope to rely on his experience in coaching French stars like Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to help Wembanyama quickly adapt to the intensity and lifestyle of the NBA. Wembanyama shed tears of joy after becoming the first overall pick, saying in an interview with ESPN, \"When I heard the NBA Commissioner announce my name, it was like a dream come true. I have dreamt about this moment many times, that's why I cried.\"</p> <p>As for the second overall pick, Brandon Miller, who stands at 6 feet 9 inches (205 cm), has excellent 3D physical attributes. He is also the only player among the top three picks who played college basketball in the United States. Although he was picked by the Charlotte Hornets, ESPN reported that during his tryout with the Hornets, Miller told the then-owner and \"Basketball God\" Michael Jordan that he is not his idol and has rarely watched Jordan play. Miller's journey to becoming the second overall pick has been full of twists and turns. Just a year ago, he was projected to be a second-round pick or even undrafted. However, Miller improved his skills and played for the number one seed in the NCAA men's basketball tournament, the University of Alabama, which propelled him to a lottery pick.</p> <p>However, in February of this year, Miller was unexpectedly involved in a shooting incident with his college teammates. Although he was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing, it almost ended his basketball career.</p> <p>If it wasn't for Wembanyama, the 6-foot-2-inch (188 cm) explosive athlete Jaden Henderson would have had a good chance of becoming this year's first overall pick. Henderson is praised for his good passing vision, excellent physical condition, and leadership qualities on the court. Other than needing to improve his three-point shooting, he has few weaknesses and has a great chance of becoming a highly regarded rookie in the league.</p> <p>Henderson played in 19 games in the developmental league this year, starting in all of them. He averaged 16.5 points and 6.8 assists per game, but only had a three-point shooting percentage of 27.5%.</p> <p>It remains to be seen what will happen after the Trail Blazers selected Henderson. Will they initiate a trade involving their star player Damian Lillard, or will they pair him up with Henderson to form a backcourt duo? Only time will tell.</p>"},{"location":"20230818161747650077/","title":"2022 Popular Keywords Review: Taiwan Star's Massive Disconnection and NAC Cough Medicine Rumor Becomes a Hot Search","text":"<p>As we approach the end of 2022, let's take a look back at the year with Google's daily trending keywords    2022 Popular Keywords Review: Taiwan Star's Massive Disconnection and NAC Cough Medicine Rumor Becomes a Hot Search</p> <p>As we approach the end of 2022, let's take a look back at the year with Google's daily trending keywords.</p> <p>This article reviews the events that drew everyone's attention in May 2022.

However, in private, he has a side that most people don't know about. First of all, he is very fond of \"fragrance.\" For example, he has four perfumes that he is very fond of, such as \"Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Crystal Flame,\" \"Maison Francis Kurkdjian OUD,\" \"Louis Vuitton L'IMMENSITE,\" and \"Louis Vuitton Les Sables Roses.\" Among them, \"Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Crystal Flame\" has floral, amber, and woody notes, bringing out the mineral fragrance of ambergris with floral scents like jasmine and saffron, as well as woody and red cedar spicy scents. On the other hand, \"Maison Francis Kurkdjian OUD\" showcases sweet saffron, labdanum, Moroccan cedar, sweet vanilla, and musk in the top notes, while the base notes are dominated by Laotian agarwood and Indonesian patchouli.</p> <p>In addition, there is also \"Louis Vuitton L'IMMENSITE,\" which is a blend of grapefruit, ginger, rock rose, and a moderate amount of amber fragrance, as well as \"Louis Vuitton Les Sables Roses,\" which combines rose with agarwood from Baghdad and has spices, leather, and animalistic scents. These are the perfumes that Howard loves.</p> <p>Furthermore, Howard is also very fond of scented candles. Whether at home, on the road, or even when watching movies, he always brings scented candles with him. Another item that Howard likes to carry with him at all times is \"sage.\" He has different types of sage, such as rosemary sage, blood sage, and wheel sage. Every time he returns home or enters the team's locker room, he smokes sage to purify himself.</p> <p>In the past, Dwight Howard (@dwighthoward) used to bring sage and smoke the entire court and every teammate before every game in the NBA.</p> <p>For Howard, this practice allows his mind to find peace and gain energy on the court. Apart from sage, there are also other objects that bring peace to Howard's mind, such as the Bible, quartz, and singing bowls, which open his mind.</p> <p>In addition to the above, he has many different habits and interests. For example, he loves chewing gum and mala beads, which freshen his breath. He also has as many as 20 to 30 speakers at home, and he always brings a speaker to the court to play music during practice. His teammates even call him \"Radio Raheem\" or \"MC Tight Sound.\"</p> <p>It is worth mentioning that this former NBA star is just like you and me, a fan who loves watching TV shows and movies. His favorite TV show is \"Game of Thrones,\" and he has watched each season at least 10 times. However, no matter how much he loves it, he also feels dumbfounded and disappointed with the ending. If you are curious about this basketball superstar who has the most fame in Taiwanese basketball history, you can follow Howard on his social media accounts. After previously live-streaming and sharing various local snacks he tasted in Taiwan, he will surely show his unique side on the court again.</p> <p>This article is authorized and reproduced by every little d.

As the daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, she has chosen a different path from her father, hoping to create her own chapter.</p> <p>Dennis Rodman, who won the NBA rebounding title for seven consecutive seasons, was always in the spotlight during his NBA career due to his rebounding abilities, tattoos, hair color, and behavior. His personal life off the court was also eventful. Trinity Rodman, born to his third wife, was not deeply connected to her father and was primarily raised by her mother. Despite inheriting her father's exceptional athletic genes, Trinity Rodman decided to pursue her passion for soccer. She started playing soccer at the age of 4, joined a youth training club at 10, and achieved remarkable success, winning four national championships. Originally planning to attend Washington State University, her rookie season was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Trinity Rodman decided to join the National Women's Soccer League and was selected by the Washington Spirit as the second overall pick in the first round, becoming the youngest player in the league's history.</p> <p>As a forward on the field, Trinity Rodman has earned accolades for her speed, shooting ability, and game reading skills. Her explosive performance has left a lasting impression on fans, and in January of last year, she was the only rookie invited to the United States women's soccer team training camp among 25 players.</p> <p>Trinity Rodman's on-field performance has been recognized by her team, and last year she signed a four-year contract extension worth $1.1 million with the Washington Spirit, making her the highest-paid player in the United States women's soccer team. Now, she wears the jersey of the United States women's soccer team in the World Cup, aiming for an unprecedented third consecutive victory. On July 22nd, she made her World Cup debut in a match against Vietnam. Despite showcasing her talent on the soccer field, Trinity Rodman often faces questions and discussions about her father, who is a famous NBA star. She once said, \"Many people don't actually know that my father has never played a significant role in my life. Many times, we have different opinions, and I often don't feel his care for months or even years.\"</p> <p>From initially having a passive attitude towards her relationship with her father to seeing him show up at her games and cheer her on, Trinity Rodman has started to find some resolution. She said, \"No matter what, he is my father, and I am his daughter. That will never change.\" Seen as the future core figure of the United States women's soccer team, Trinity Rodman has now learned to accept her last name and takes pride in being a Rodman. She looks forward to creating her own story in the future, where people will refer to her as Trinity Rodman, rather than just Rodman's daughter.</p>"},{"location":"20230818161913978791/","title":"The Denver Nuggets, in their 47th year in the NBA, defeated the Miami Heat with a final score of 94-89 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals","text":"<p>The Denver Nuggets, in their 47th year in the NBA, defeated the Miami Heat with a final score of 94-89 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals.

The NBA Finals, which follows a 7-game series with the first team to win 4 games, saw the Nuggets return to their home court with a 3-1 advantage over the Heat.</p> <p>Tyler Herro, who averaged 20.1 points per game and was the second-leading scorer for the Heat during the regular season, made a comeback after undergoing surgery for a right hand fracture in the first playoff game against the Milwaukee Bucks.</p> <p>The Heat started the game with a 5-0 run, but the Nuggets quickly responded with a 12-0 run to take the lead. Despite falling behind by 8 points, the Heat managed to regain the lead with consecutive three-pointers from Bam Adebayo, finishing the first quarter with a 24-22 advantage.</p> <p>In the first half, the Nuggets struggled with their three-point shooting, making only 1 out of 15 attempts. Led by Adebayo's 18 points, the Heat maintained a 51-44 lead at halftime.</p> <p>The Nuggets tied the game at 60-60 with a three-pointer from Jamal Murray in the third quarter. The two teams engaged in a back-and-forth battle, with the Nuggets taking the lead with a three-pointer from Michael Porter Jr., only for the Heat to regain the lead with a three-pointer from Kyle Lowry. After three quarters, the Heat held a slim 71-70 lead.</p> <p>In the final quarter, the Nuggets took the lead after a basket from Jokic and extended it to 7 points. However, the Heat fought back with five consecutive points from Jimmy Butler to regain the lead. With 27 seconds remaining and the Heat trailing 89-90, they made a crucial mistake that resulted in a turnover. The Nuggets capitalized on this and sealed the victory with four made free throws, winning by a margin of 5 points.</p> <p>The Nuggets defeated the Heat 4-1 in the NBA Finals, securing their first NBA championship since joining the league in 1976. In this game, Jokic scored 28 points and grabbed 16 rebounds, while Porter Jr. contributed 16 points and 13 rebounds. Murray added 14 points and 8 assists.</p> <p>For the Heat, five players scored in double digits, with Butler leading the team with 21 points and Adebayo contributing 20 points and 12 rebounds. However, the Heat struggled on the boards, being outrebounded 71-50, which proved to be a major disadvantage.</p> <p>Looking back at the Nuggets' history, the team experienced a five-year rebuilding period before emerging as champions under the leadership of Jokic, Murray, and coach Malone. The Nuggets became the second team to win an NBA championship after merging from the ABA (American Basketball Association) into the NBA. The ABA and NBA were in competition until 1976 when the ABA merged with the NBA, leaving only four ABA teams in the NBA, including the Nuggets.</p> <p>The Nuggets, originally known as the Larks and later renamed the Rockets in their first season, became the Nuggets in 1974. They reached the NBA Finals in their last season before the ABA-NBA merger in 1976 but lost to the New York Nets.</p> <p>Throughout their history, the Nuggets have consistently made the playoffs, reaching the postseason in all nine seasons in the ABA. However, they only made it to the NBA Finals once. After joining the NBA, the Nuggets made the playoffs nine times in the 1980s and ten consecutive seasons from 2004 to 2013 but never won the championship.</p> <p>Despite entering a rebuilding phase from the 2013-14 season, the Nuggets quietly laid the foundation for success. The team selected Jokic in 2014, Murray in 2016, and Porter Jr. in 2018 in the NBA Draft. They also hired Malone as the coach in 2015. These moves eventually paid off in the 2018-19 season when the Nuggets finished with a 54-28 record, securing the second seed in the Western Conference.</p> <p>Throughout their 47-year history, the Nuggets have produced several notable players, including Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, and Carmelo Anthony. The team has also had coaches like George Karl, known for their offensive style of play in an era dominated by defensive-minded teams.</p> <p>The Nuggets moved to the Pepsi Center in 1999, which is located at an altitude of 5,280 feet. The high altitude and thin air have given the Nuggets a natural home court advantage. Jokic, who was initially slightly overweight when he entered the NBA, transformed his physique and became a dominant force on the court. He has since been recognized as an MVP-caliber player.</p> <p>Jokic, a 28-year-old Serbian center standing at 6 feet 11 inches (approximately 210 cm), was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft with the 41st overall pick. He made an immediate impact in the NBA, earning a spot on the All-Rookie First Team. Despite his initially \"chubby\" appearance compared to other players, Jokic has continuously improved his scoring, averaging 10, 16.7, 18.5, and eventually 20.1 points per game, along with increasing rebound numbers. In the 2019-20 season, he slightly declined with averages of 19.9 points and 9.7 rebounds.</p>"},{"location":"20230818161958798966/","title":"The NBA Spurs won the No","text":"<p>The NBA Spurs won the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft lottery and are likely to select the highly-touted \"French monster\" Victor Wembanyama.

Now, the Rockets are facing a crucial decision that will significantly impact their future - whether to choose stability or aggressiveness.</p> <p>To transition from a rebuilding phase to a competitive team, it is crucial for the Rockets to establish a stable offensive system. Given the chaos the Rockets have experienced in the past four years, it is well-known how Alperen Sengun has been wasted under Stephen Silas. With the appointment of Ime Udoka, the former Celtics head coach who led the team to the NBA Finals, Sengun finally has the opportunity to shine. As a former Celtics coach, Udoka understands the importance of having a center with high-level playmaking abilities on the court. In the previous season, Udoka deliberately utilized Al Horford as a connector at the top of the key, using simple Chicago action plays to create different patterns. He also implemented tactics like Stagger screen and Ram screen to maximize Horford's abilities and value.</p> <p>Playing under Udoka, who values discipline, even star scoring wings like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown do not have the authority to disregard the team's offensive system. This means that Kevin Porter Jr's ball-dominant and uncontrolled habits would be significantly masked. Whether it is playing time or role positioning, Sengun has the opportunity to regain his deserved share. However, things seem to have changed after the July summer league.</p> <p>As the 2021 draft's third overall pick, Jabari Smith Jr (JSJ) has always been expected to become the best companion for Jalen Green. However, his monotonous offensive value as a rookie was not enough to shoulder the responsibilities of a second-in-command. Nevertheless, in the July summer league, JSJ showcased a new side to Rockets fans. Unlike his usual role as a perimeter receiver in the regular season, Jabari Smith Jr took on more ball-handling responsibilities in the summer league, scoring 33 points with 7 rebounds and 38 points with 7 rebounds and 6 assists in two games. His shooting percentages of 48.8/33.3/85.2 were much more efficient than in the regular season. Building on his scoring threat, JSJ even demonstrated his ability to initiate high-level attacks, showcasing his playmaking value as a forward. This has made Sengun's future development more uncertain.</p> <p>The example of Al Horford mentioned earlier actually leaves room for discussion. Since developing his three-point shooting with the Atlanta Hawks in 2015, Horford maintained a level of shooting performance over the following seven seasons. Even though Horford's three-point shooting percentage was a personal low in Udoka's season coaching the Celtics, averaging 3.8 three-point attempts per game with a 33.6% overall three-point shooting percentage and a 35.6% catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage is still useful for a center. Horford's value as a perimeter shooter is the key to his versatile role, whether it be pick-and-pop, pop-out after off-screen actions, or spot-up catch-and-shoot opportunities. However, Alperen Sengun only attempted 0.8 three-pointers per game last season with a 33.3% shooting percentage. Although his abilities are limited at this stage, his potential in shooting cannot be ignored. On the other hand, Jabari Smith Jr's shooting prospects are much brighter compared to Sengun's. Stability will be an issue for JSJ to address in the future, but his college career has already shown a high shooting ceiling, and he may even become a better shooter than Horford, able to shoot without being disturbed. This will truly replicate Horford's on-court value.</p> <p>From this, it is evident that the Rockets' biggest challenge at this stage is which offensive system to establish, especially considering the future core of Jalen Green, Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, and Cam Whitmore.</p> <p>Option One: Reuse Alperen Sengun and replicate the Grizzlies' model of relying on Steven Adams' high-level impact to maintain offensive stability. This not only gives Sengun the potential to have a similar offensive impact as All-Star Domantas Sabonis in the future but also covers the inconsistent offense of players like Jalen Green, Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, and Cam Whitmore, concealing their flaws. Similar to how Steven Adams clears the way for Ja Morant and Desmond Bane, this option can provide insurance for the majority of the Rockets' players who are still in the process of realizing their talent.</p> <p>(Note: The original text contains specific player names and photo-related descriptions, which have been removed as per the request.)</p>"},{"location":"20230818162045852903/","title":"The Unforeseen Two Years of Bai Yaocheng's Journey","text":"<p>How many years does it take for one's life to completely turn around?

Following that, he had another opportunity to wear the national team jersey as a member of the Chinese White Team in this year's Jones Cup.</p> <p>\"Never did I imagine that one day I would be a part of the Chinese national team, not even from my days in Yu-Shou University,\" Bai Yaocheng said. Bai Yaocheng's basketball journey is interesting, or rather, the fact that we can discuss his \"basketball journey\" is already surprising. He wasn't initially seen as a talented player. He was just an active kid who played basketball during his free time. In fourth grade, his coach noticed his potential and took him to training. After graduating from elementary school, Bai Yaocheng entered Taichung Fengyang Junior High School, where he became classmates with the \"Fengyang Three Musketeers,\" who had previously competed in the HBL (High School Basketball League). He continued his basketball training from elementary school but suffered a torn meniscus in his knee during practice. Due to the injury and his original lack of interest in basketball, he transferred to Yu-Ying Junior High School, which was closer to home. Bai Yaocheng thought that his basketball journey was over at that point. However, things took a different turn. Despite the injury and his lack of interest, Bai Yaocheng joined the basketball team at Tungshan High School, which seemed like a good compromise for him. Although the Tungshan High School basketball team was not considered a top-tier team and the training was not too rigorous, everything changed when Liao Yinzhong, who was originally coaching the established HBL team from Nanhu High School, became the new coach at Tungshan High School. This greatly altered the plans for Tungshan and Bai Yaocheng. Tungshan specifically brought in Liao Yinzhong, who had years of coaching experience in the HBL, and Liao immediately set the goal for the team to challenge the top-tier HBL division. Bai Yaocheng resisted initially but eventually accepted Liao Yinzhong's arrangement. The subsequent journey was completely different from what Bai Yaocheng had expected. Despite his initial lack of expectations, Bai Yaocheng led Tungshan High School to success in the HBL, reaching the top eight. Then, with Liao Yinzhong's recommendation, he joined the famous basketball program at National Kaohsiung Normal University, where under the guidance of coach Xie Yujuan, Bai Yaocheng gradually grew into the team's playmaker. He also became a member of the \"Tungshan Gang,\" a group of players from Tungshan High School. As the Tungshan Gang became increasingly vital for National Kaohsiung Normal University, Bai Yaocheng and his teammates replaced the previous main sources of players from Sanmin Commercial High School. The three main players from Tungshan High School, Bai Yaocheng, Qiu Zixuan, and Liu Chengyan, not only led National Kaohsiung Normal University to success but also joined the professional league, continuing the legacy of the \"Tungshan Spirit\" in the basketball community.</p> <p>This basketball journey truly changed Bai Yaocheng's life. However, he is not someone who has always had great confidence in himself, whether it be the gap in ambition from the beginning or the intensity he felt on the court. It is not that he lacked talent. It is just that his coaches, from Liao Yinzhong in high school to Xie Yujuan in university, and now Coach Xu Haocheng of the Chinese White Team, all remind him of his offensive abilities and encourage him to be more proactive on the court, not just a pass-first point guard. For Bai Yaocheng, the affirmation from coaches at different levels makes him feel truly trusted and motivated.</p> <p>\"During each transition, I always worry if I can continue to improve and move up. Even after joining National Kaohsiung Normal University, I thought I could only play until the end of college. So, the affirmation from each coach at different stages is crucial to me,\" Bai Yaocheng said.</p> <p>In the Jones Cup, apart from being rested for the game against the United States, Bai Yaocheng started in three out of four games and played over 20 minutes in each game. He clearly plays a vital role as a key substitute in the backcourt for the coaching staff. After coming off the bench in the recent game on August 17th, Bai Yaocheng showcased his speed multiple times, including two impressive drives to the basket. He earned praise from the coaching staff. Despite the Chinese White Team's loss to Qatar with a final score of 59-71, Bai Yaocheng, as a game-changing weapon off the bench, scored the team's highest 11 points, once again earning the trust of the coaching staff. Within two years, he not only stepped onto the professional stage but also played in international games, wearing the \"Chinese\" jersey. Bai Yaocheng describes himself as \"leveling up and defeating monsters.\" These opponents were something he never thought about before. But the fact that the coaches believed in him, as if he successfully cleared a level, gives him an incredible feeling.</p> <p>In terms of talent, Bai Yaocheng may not be the most anticipated player. However, the skills he has accumulated along the way have been enough to receive this affirmation and opportunities to enter the professional league and even represent the national team. Describing it as \"incredible\" may not sound like a self-assessment that a player capable of making the national team would give themselves, but Bai Yaocheng has indeed embarked on a journey that he never expected. For all those who have considered giving up or had no interest but still returned to the path of basketball, perhaps this experience can serve as a reference.</p> <p>However, we already know that Bai Yaocheng, who continues to absorb growth and truly walks the path of basketball, has many challenges waiting for him in the future.

The fact that the JKO Lioneers were willing to give up last year's foreign student, Iboka, for Alasa shows how enticing his potential is.</p> <p>Born in Gambia, Alasa has had a basketball dream that spans over 13,000 kilometers. He started playing basketball at the age of 12 but never received formal training. Relying on his natural talent, he joined the Senegal Premier League at the age of 16. Please continue reading as we always hope to find suitable candidates for the Chinese national team.</p> <p>Alasa possesses good abilities such as talent, height, agility, and wingspan. In the past, we have mostly looked for centers, but why not try finding a power forward instead? After all, training in Africa is highly competitive, and it would be better for him to come to Taiwan to learn.</p> <p>With a height of 205 centimeters and a wingspan of 211 centimeters, Alasa's talent is outstanding. However, he has not yet reached the super elite level required to enter the NBA, so Gambia does not have plans to focus resources on his development.</p> <p>Unable to bear the thought of such a raw talent being buried, three years ago, Hsinchu JKO Lioneers General Manager Gao Jingyan actively recommended him to come to Taiwan for formal basketball training.</p> <p>The JKO Lioneers have been one of my benefactors in Taiwan. Kenny (Gao Jingyan) can be considered my father in Taiwan. Wherever I am, he has given me a lot of help. He really takes care of me, and I am very grateful to him.</p> <p>From arriving in Taiwan, being stuck in Thailand for eight months due to the pandemic, to attending high school and university in Taiwan, and becoming a practice player for the JKO Lioneers in between, Kenny has played an important role in all of it. Although Kenny is no longer the general manager of the JKO Lioneers on the night of the draft, after Alasa found out he was the top pick, he still gave a big hug to Kenny, his \"Taiwanese father.\" Please continue reading as Alasa's hard work, just to \"survive,\" is something I believe local students should learn from.</p> <p>The basketball environment in Taiwan is very comfortable. When training time is up, everyone stops. But you should know that some people continue to work hard to survive while you rest.</p> <p>Because he came to Taiwan, it was not just for himself, but also for the survival of his family. So, every time I see Alasa training and controlling his diet, I feel that local students really need to emulate him.</p> <p>The reason Alasa became the top pick is not only because of his outstanding talent but also because of his hard work. His coach at Taiwan National University of Arts, Li Bolun, mentioned this in a podcast interview. While many people rest, Alasa would go on his own to practice shooting and weight training.</p> <p>For him, the University Basketball Association (UBA) is not his only goal. He aspires to enter a professional basketball league and provide better living conditions for his family in Gambia. This lofty goal allows him to endure rigorous training and demonstrate high levels of discipline and diligence. And behind all of this is the desire to \"survive.\" Alasa has only been playing basketball for two years in Taiwan.</p> <p>I think this level of progress is already significant. In the 110th academic year, Alasa became the scoring champion, rebounding champion, and blocking champion with an average of 19.1 points, 15.2 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game. The following year, his performance evolved even further, with him becoming the scoring champion and rebounding champion with averages of 23.6 points and 17.8 rebounds per game. In a game against Overseas Chinese University of Technology, he achieved a new career-high of 51 points. Looking at the growth in his statistics, it is evident that Alasa has evolved, but he still has weaknesses.</p> <p>Firstly, although he has improved his fundamental skills, his short basketball experience means there is still room for improvement in dribbling, passing, and mid-range shooting.</p> <p>In terms of defense, his matchup against foreign student Mobaye from National Chengchi University highlights Alasa's lack of experience against players who have been training in basketball since childhood. This is one of the reasons why Taiwan National University of Arts was eliminated this year. Please continue reading as there is still a long way to go. Many people have a question: Alasa has indeed performed well at the university level, but can he handle the intensity of a professional league? After all, apart from Pauian Archiland's Landry, the turnover rate of foreign players in PLG has been very high in recent years.</p> <p>I believe one of the reasons, apart from competition for spots, is that at the university level, many foreign players rely on their physique and athleticism to solve problems, which disguises their lack of experience and skills. This may work against local students, but in a professional league, not only is the local competition stronger, but foreign players often have to face taller and more athletic imports, which makes their advantages less prominent.</p> <p>For example, in the past, they could rely on their bodies to push through defenses, but in a professional league, they may not have enough experience and skills to score with other methods. This reduces their threat on the court.</p>"},{"location":"20230818162324025902/","title":"No Longer the Essential Foundation for a Championship, James Harden Now Symbolizes Something Different","text":"<p>Whether James Harden successfully switches teams or stays with the Philadelphia 76ers, he must bring his best game in the upcoming season to show everyone that he is still a valuable player worth investing in   No Longer the Essential Foundation for a Championship, James Harden Now Symbolizes Something Different</p> <p>Whether James Harden successfully switches teams or stays with the Philadelphia 76ers, he must bring his best game in the upcoming season to show everyone that he is still a valuable player worth investing in. After opting into the final year of his contract, Harden requested a trade from the team, leaving everyone curious about his true intentions. Although the 76ers' starting lineup is not perfect, they have a strong overall team.</p> <p>Continuing to read, as long as the reigning MVP Joel Embiid stays healthy, young star Tyrese Maxey continues to improve, Harden showcases his skills, and other players perform consistently, the 76ers have the potential to contend for a championship. Typically, a quasi-Hall of Fame player who is only missing a championship ring would not leave a team like this. However, Harden, who spent seven years as the leader of the Houston Rockets and was an MVP candidate during those years, might leave Philadelphia this summer. If he is traded, it would be his fourth team change in four years. Harden's frequency of team switches is almost comparable to that of his former Thunder teammate Westbrook, despite their contrasting playing styles.</p> <p>Since leaving the Rockets, Harden has been traded to teams that were considered championship contenders, but he has never made it to the NBA Finals. So even if he is traded to the Los Angeles Clippers, a team that is expected to contend, it might not be beneficial for him.</p> <p>Reports indicate that Philadelphia 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey explicitly told Harden that he hoped he would exercise his player option for the final year of his contract. It seems strange that Harden would still request a trade under these circumstances, especially when there is a chance to acquire superstar Damian Lillard through a trade this summer. Perhaps this move is to hold more bargaining power in a potential Harden trade (to improve his trade value by making his relationship with the team appear less strained), and the 76ers still hope that if they continue to work together next season, Harden will be willing to give his all.</p> <p>Continuing to read, theoretically, players should always give their all on the court, but Harden has had a history of displaying a lack of effort.</p> <p>During his final days with the Rockets, he went four consecutive games without scoring more than 20 points. This was something that had never happened in his previous eight years with the Rockets. Even though Harden said in an interview, \"I've given everything I have, and I don't think this situation is unsolvable, it's too crazy,\" it was clear that he wanted the Rockets to trade him.</p> <p>Even if Harden is unable to land on another team, the situation with the 76ers is different from his time with the Rockets. In the new season, we can still expect to see Harden playing seriously because he has no choice.</p> <p>With only one year left on his contract and turning 34 soon, he must give his all on the court. There were rumors that he wanted the team to offer him a long-term and high-paying contract, but reports suggest that the 76ers are not willing to do so, which has left Harden frustrated with the team.</p> <p>Continuing to read, in the upcoming offseason, there may be teams willing to offer him a big contract, similar to the three-year, $126 million deal with a player option in the final year that the Dallas Mavericks offered Kyrie Irving. However, the key is for Harden to give his all in the last year of his current contract so that he can become a coveted player in the market and have a chance to secure a bigger contract.</p> <p>Photos source: Getty Images. There are not many teams in need of a floor general like Harden at his price point, and if he fails to deliver a good performance in the new season or show his determination, there will be almost no teams willing to spend a huge salary to acquire him.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Harden still possesses great skills. Last season, he averaged 21 points per game and became the assist leader with an average of 10.7 assists per game. He should have been selected for the All-Star Game last season, but the team needs him to perform consistently in every game, not just have a few explosive performances, especially during the playoffs.</p> <p>In the second round of last season's playoffs, when Embiid missed the first game, Harden scored an impressive 45 points in a single game. In the fifth game of that series, he scored 42 points. However, excluding these two games, he only scored a total of 67 points in the other six games of the series. The 76ers were heavily defeated in the seventh game against the Celtics, and Harden's stats for that game were 9 points, 7 assists, 5 turnovers, with a plus-minus value of -30.</p> <p>Photos source: Getty Images. Looking at Harden's overall performance throughout his career, especially in the playoffs, it becomes clear that he cannot guarantee victory for his team.</p> <p>If he ultimately stays with the 76ers, they will undoubtedly lose out, especially if they have the opportunity to acquire Lillard through a reasonable trade, as Lillard would be a better choice. However, the 76ers might not be able to acquire Lillard in a trade. In such a scenario, the team must not let the situation with Harden become too strained and ensure that he is willing to give his all in the final year of his contract.</p> <p>As for Harden, despite his dissatisfaction with the team, for his personal interests, it is believed that he will still strive to perform well in the new season to earn his next contract.</p>"},{"location":"20230821093456883037/","title":"Chaos in the Chinese men's basketball team: The lack of point guard remains a persistent problem","text":"<p>In the game between the Chinese national team and their opponents in the Jones Cup last night, despite maintaining a lead throughout the game and winning by a 17-point margin, it is undeniable that there were deviations in both offense and defense    Chaos in the Chinese men's basketball team: The lack of point guard remains a persistent problem</p> <p>In the game between the Chinese national team and their opponents in the Jones Cup last night, despite maintaining a lead throughout the game and winning by a 17-point margin, it is undeniable that there were deviations in both offense and defense.</p> <p>With injuries to key backup point guards, Coach Sonny Sandoval decided to have Lin Tingqian and Wu Yongsheng fill in, and even had Zeng Wendong assist from the sidelines. This move was meant to test whether this would become the team's biggest disadvantage in the upcoming Asian Games. Let's analyze further.</p> <p>Please continue reading \u25bc Successful recruitment but unexpected injuries became uncontrollable factors. This year, the Chinese team was divided into four groups, utilizing resources from overseas, the three major leagues, and college basketball to successfully form a team with potential and strength. The first-line team, which mainly focuses on preparing for the Asian Games, is the Chinese national team in the Jones Cup. The recruitment process went smoothly, but injuries quietly became a hidden concern, preventing the team from being at full strength. From the exhibition games in Japan to the start of the Jones Cup, injuries to the point guards have been a constant issue. Lin Wei-han underwent surgery and withdrew, Chen Ying-jun underwent surgery and rested, and Li Kai-yan and Zhou Guiyu recently withdrew from training due to injuries. This has affected the overall tactical operation and rhythm control of the team.</p> <p>Although the Chinese team's lineup in the Jones Cup has a good balance of offense and defense, there are still many players who lack experience. From the establishment of the team, it has been evident that they need a leader to take charge. While it is unfortunate that players are getting injured, it is not their fault. It is difficult to compete in a long season without injuries. The severity of the injuries and whether they will affect continuous participation in games are the main concerns. Coach Sonny Sandoval, who has inherited the Charlie Parker system, sees the point guard as the regulator of the team's pace, the most important position outside the paint. The current predicament is evident, and he has expressed in multiple interviews the impact this has brought. We hope that they can recover from their injuries and contribute to the team's success in the Asian Games. Before the Jones Cup, Coach Sandoval mentioned that Lin Tingqian would play the point guard position, with Wu Yongsheng replacing Li Kai-yan and Zhou Guiyu. However, due to the withdrawal of the Olympic men's basketball pre-qualification tournament, Wei Jiahao, Lin Bingsheng, and Zhang Jiahe were added to the team to inject fresh energy into the backcourt, hoping to achieve the desired results in the games.</p> <p>Please continue reading \u25bc Switching the ball-dominant axis for an activating effect and achieving four consecutive wins. Fans can read the article \"The Overlay Effect of the New and Old Systems: The Influence Brought by Coach Sonny Sandoval\" on the website, which discusses the system operation of the Chinese national team in the Jones Cup. Since the exhibition games in Japan, the biggest change has been the shift in the ball-dominant core, from focusing on the backcourt to achieving a balance. This allows players in the fourth and fifth positions to have the ball in their hands, with the frontcourt running and creating offensive opportunities or stretching the defense to attack the rim. This helps alleviate the pressure of lacking a point guard.</p> <p>In the first four games, Lin Tingqian and Wu Yongsheng played the point guard position, while Zeng Wendong acted as the invisible playmaker. They each had three assists in two games, leaving the rhythm of the game in their hands.</p> <p>Looking at the performances of the Chinese team in each game, in the first game against the Philippines, they recorded 24 assists, mostly concentrated in the backcourt and on Li Dewei. The main focus was on fast breaks and half-court offensive strategies. In the second game against Japan, Wu Yongsheng took charge of the point guard position, but the frontcourt had strong offensive energy, running fast and attracting double teams to create open shots. Liu Zheng and Abass combined for 10 assists, proving that both teams were not strong, and they didn't face many difficulties.</p> <p>In the game against Qatar two days ago, Lin Tingqian and Zeng Wendong took control of the ball. They used pick-and-roll plays and high-low positioning, allowing Atyanov to shoot with a 75% field goal percentage. Lin Tingqian scored in the first half and assisted in the second half, stabilizing the offensive and defensive rhythm and preventing the opponent's counterattacks. Yesterday's game against Iran was chaotic, with a total of 16 assists, the lowest in the four games. Apart from Zeng Wendong's solid half-court play, most of the offense relied on strong attacks from the frontcourt. The ball movement was not smooth, and there were even moments where it was hard to see any organization, resulting in deviations in the game. From the above observations, it can be seen that the Chinese team no longer heavily relies on the point guard for ball possession and offense. Instead, they focus on strong defense and transitioning from offense to defense. They develop their offense in two areas: the backcourt and pick-and-roll plays with Atyanov, as well as high-low positioning in the paint. In terms of assists, fast breaks are still more prominent than half-court plays. Depending on the opponent and the lineup, the ball-dominant axis is distributed across different positions, showcasing a versatile lineup.</p> <p>Please continue reading \u25bc Individual breakthroughs are still stronger than group collaboration, and half-court offense is not easy to execute. First and foremost, it must be emphasized that the teams in the Jones Cup are not top-tier, so it is not difficult for the Chinese team to win. Therefore, the focus should be on the content of the games and how the team adjusts as a whole. Indeed, without a strong point guard on the court, the organization and system heavily rely on the players' performance on that day. If they are playing well, they can control the rhythm, but if not, it can become chaotic. This is the dilemma facing the Chinese team. (1) Is it a waste to have Lin Tingqian play as a point guard? Lin Tingqian is the best physically conditioned player among the top three in the CBA. He has a variety of offensive moves and is strong in one-on-one situations. He can be considered the Chinese team's most powerful weapon. While he mainly plays as a shooting guard in the league, he also has experience playing as a point guard. However, organizing the team is not his natural inclination. Therefore, playing him as a point guard is a last resort. Coach Sonny Sandoval mentioned that it was a difficult decision but a relatively secure configuration. I support this decision, as there are no other options and Lin Tingqian's ability to play as a combo guard would be beneficial for his future development. By not solely focusing on offense and expanding the team's effectiveness, the key is to find the right balance between his attack and organization skills to maximize his impact.</p>"},{"location":"20230821093538507157/","title":"Terror balance with a heavy head and light feet, three problems to watch in the recent Sun's trading of Bol Bol for Cam Payne and collecting second-round picks","text":"<p>Terror balance with a heavy head and light feet, three problems to watch in the recent Sun's trading of Bol Bol for Cam Payne and collecting second-round picks.</p> <p>The Suns have been one of the most active teams during the offseason, making headlines with the Bradley Beal trade rumors. After the start of the free agency period, they have also signed Drew Eubanks, Keita Bates-Diop (KBD), Chimezie Metu, Yuta Watanabe, and Eric Gordon. They have also reached contract extensions with Josh Okogie and Damion Lee.</p> <p>With their roster taking shape for the new season, the Suns have been making adjustments through signings and trades. First, they sent backup point guard Cam Payne along with a second-round pick to the Spurs in exchange for a protected future second-round pick. They then acquired 23-year-old forward Bol Bol, who was recently waived by the Magic, in a trade involving draft picks.</p> <p>Bol Bol, like Eubanks, KBD, Metu, and Watanabe, can play multiple positions in the frontcourt. However, he stands out with his unique physical attributes. Standing at 7'2\" (218cm) with a wingspan of 7'8\" (234cm), Bol possesses a versatile skill set similar to this year's top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama (7'4\" tall with a 7'10\" wingspan). This has earned him the nickname \"Original Wembanyama.\"</p> <p>Last season, Bol had his best performance since entering the league four years ago. In 70 games played, he averaged 9.1 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game, all career highs. However, his performance fluctuated throughout the season.</p> <p>In the first two and a half months of the season, Bol played 37 games, starting in 32 of them and averaging 26.1 minutes per game. He contributed an average of 12.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, and shot 58.8% from the field. But as the Magic's injured players Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, and Jalen Suggs returned in 2023, Bol's playing time and production decreased. In the next 33 games, he only started in one game and averaged 10 minutes less on the court, resulting in 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds per game.</p> <p>The most significant impact of the inconsistent playing time was seen in Bol's three-point shooting. In the first two and a half months, he had a catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage of 38.1%. However, in 2023, it dropped to a dismal 8.6%.</p> <p>Despite this, Bol remains a unique player when looking at advanced statistics. His height and smooth shooting touch make him difficult to stop on cuts to the basket, ranking him in the top 5% in efficiency. His height and wingspan also give him an advantage in offensive rebounding, with a top 5% efficiency in putbacks.</p> <p>Bol's excellent ball-handling skills allow him to drive the ball on his own during fast breaks, making decisions based on the defense's positioning. He can either take it to the rim or make a quick stop-and-pop three-pointer. His transition offense accounted for 27.6% of his overall offensive contributions last season, ranking him 15th in the league, higher than any other Suns player.</p> <p>Unlike most big men who act as screeners in pick-and-roll situations, Bol, with his versatile ball-handling skills, can also act as the ball handler. In today's positionless basketball trend, where big men handle the ball and forwards and guards can play multiple positions, Bol stands out as the number one among 7' tall players in pick-and-roll ball handling, accounting for 8.6% of his overall offensive contributions.</p> <p>In summary, Bol Bol's all-around abilities in shooting, cutting, and passing make him a valuable piece in the coach's tactical adjustments on the offensive end. However, his impact on defense may not be as significant due to his thin frame despite his towering height. Within 6 feet of the rim, opponents' shooting percentage actually increases by 1.1% when defended by Bol, ranking him seventh from the bottom among all 7' tall players in the league last season.</p>"},{"location":"20230821093601114518/","title":"What level is the Chinese Blue team in the NCAA Jones Cup, and how can the UC Irvine coach defeat most mid-tier teams?","text":"<p>The head coach of UC Irvine, Russell Turner, led his team to a 95-80 victory over the Chinese Blue team in the recent Jones Cup tournament    What level is the Chinese Blue team in the NCAA Jones Cup, and how can the UC Irvine coach defeat most mid-tier teams?</p> <p>The head coach of UC Irvine, Russell Turner, led his team to a 95-80 victory over the Chinese Blue team in the recent Jones Cup tournament. The question of the disparity between Asian and American teams has sparked discussions. Where does the national team's level stand in the NCAA Division I basketball league in the United States? Coach Russell Turner first responded to the game by expressing his gratitude for the opportunity to come to Taiwan and participate in the Jones Cup. He was amazed by the atmosphere at the venue and the dedication of Taiwanese fans who cheered for the teams. The Chinese team took the lead in the first quarter, which could have easily knocked them out. Regarding his team's counterattack, Coach Turner described them as playing like a championship team. The players showed great determination to win this game and emphasized the importance they placed on the Jones Cup. He believes that their ability to win the championship in this tournament is due to the team's depth and athleticism, which align well with the format of the Jones Cup. When asked about how Asian teams perform in NCAA Division I, Coach Turner stated that his team is also strong.

The Chinese Blue team, according to Coach Turner, is a highly competitive team in NCAA Division I and can defeat most mid-tier universities. On certain days, they can even win against strong opponents because of their good teamwork. He praised the team's organizers and coaching staff for showcasing the team's strengths.

The Chinese White Team's last victory was a week ago, so their goal for today was to end the tournament on a high note with another win.</p> <p>The Chinese White Team carried their momentum from yesterday's game against the South Korean Team and performed better both offensively and defensively than in their previous games. They took a 12-6 lead with contributions from Ma Jianhao, Chen Fan Boyan, and Hong Kaijie.

Please continue reading on Instagram to see the full story.</p> <p>Lin Bingsheng, who has a significant presence on Instagram, continuously reposted the well wishes from Central Bank fans who bid him farewell after announcing the end of his relationship with the team. However, it was noticed that he had not reposted the \"Welcome\" message from his \"new team,\" which was quite unusual and raised suspicions among sensitive fans.</p> <p>Then, at noon on the 16th, Lin Bingsheng posted on his Instagram, thanking everyone for their concern and blessings, as well as expressing gratitude to the Lioneers for the opportunity. He explained that due to personal career planning considerations, he had repeatedly expressed thanks and apologies but declined to join the team.</p> <p>This post was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, igniting the atmosphere in Taiwan's basketball community and leaving people breathless.</p> <p>Around two in the afternoon, while fans and media were still speculating about the \"truth\" between the Lioneers and Lin Bingsheng, the Lioneers, feeling betrayed, issued a statement saying they would \"seek legal means to defend the team's rights.\" They also shared a screenshot of the \"appointment contract\" signed by both parties, clearly showing the company seal and the signatures of the representatives.</p> <p>As the situation unfolded, Lin Bingsheng was attacked and ridiculed by many fans for allegedly breaching his contract and attempting to switch teams with a gun.</p> <p>The actions of the new T1 team, Taipei Taishin, which was speculated to be involved in the raid, also received criticism from many fans. The Lioneers directly labeled this behavior as \"malicious poaching of contracted players.\"</p> <p>In this drama of Taiwanese basketball, where the line between appointment and employment is blurred, it is rare to have the opportunity to see the actual signatures of players on contracts. However, the use of the term \"appointment contract\" by the Lioneers is perplexing.</p> <p>Article 549 of the Civil Code explicitly states that \"either party to the appointment contract may terminate the contract at any time. If one party terminates the contract during a period unfavorable to the other party, they shall be liable for damages. However, if the termination is not attributable to that party, it is not subject to this limitation.\" Some argue that this means the contract between Lin Bingsheng and the Lioneers can be terminated at any time, so the poaching behavior may indeed be valid.</p> <p>However, in the practical interpretation of Taiwanese courts, the determination is not solely based on the wording of the contract. In 2015, after a dispute with a spectator on the sidelines, the Fubon Braves unilaterally terminated their multi-year contract with Zheng Renwei, citing \"improper behavior damaging the team's image.\" Zheng Renwei disagreed and filed a lawsuit with the court to \"confirm the existence of the contract.\"</p> <p>At the end of the \"appointment contract\" publicly released by the Hsinchu JKO Lioneers, the signatures of the representative of Party A and the handwritten signature of Lin Bingsheng can be clearly seen. Source: PLG Hsinchu JKO Lioneers.</p> <p>The court stated that the contract clearly demonstrated \"the unique personality, organizational, and economic subordination inherent in an employment relationship,\" and that there was a continuous provision of services in exchange for remuneration, with the team having complete control and supervision. Therefore, the contract could not be automatically regarded as an appointment contract based solely on its wording. Instead, it was determined that there was a continuous employment relationship between the two parties. The court ruled against the Fubon team, stating that Zheng Renwei's actions did not reach the level of direct termination, and there was a risk of abuse of power.</p>"},{"location":"20230821093649125950/","title":"Gabe Norwood's Journey in the 2023 Jones Cup: A Trip Down Memory Lane","text":"<p>Although his face still appears very young, this slender man who continues to run on the court with full force is already 38 years old, undoubtedly a player who can be called a \"veteran\" in basketball    Gabe Norwood's Journey in the 2023 Jones Cup: A Trip Down Memory Lane</p> <p>Although his face still appears very young, this slender man who continues to run on the court with full force is already 38 years old, undoubtedly a player who can be called a \"veteran\" in basketball. This is Gabe Norwood, a well-known Filipino-American player and former member of the Philippine national team. This year, he was invited to Taiwan again with the Elasto Painters team for the PBA single-team nature of the Jones Cup, which is being held again after a three-year suspension. Taiwan is not a strange term or place for Norwood. He has participated in the Jones Cup three times, but the most recent time was in 2015, 8 years ago. The first time he came to Taiwan and put on the Philippines national team \"Gilas\" jersey was in 2007, a remarkable 16 years ago. \"A few days ago when we played against Chinese Taipei, I looked at the Hsu brothers (Hsu Dan, Hsu Po) and thought, 'When I first came to Taiwan, I was their age. I was running and jumping just like them,'\" Norwood said. Please continue reading (Image source: Basketball Association provided). </p> <p>Norwood grew up in the United States and moved several times due to his father being a member of a coaching staff in American football. He later attended George Mason University, and in the 2006 NCAA tournament, George Mason made a surprising \"Cinderella\" run to the Final Four, completing the most amazing journey in NCAA history. Although George Mason was not a bottom-seeded team in the tournament, they were ranked 11th seed and defeated top-ranked schools such as Michigan State, North Carolina, Wichita State, and Connecticut. They eventually lost to the champion, the University of Florida, in the Final Four. This was George Mason's first and only time reaching the Final Four, a memory that Norwood still cherishes. </p> <p>\"We didn't have a single NBA player, zero,\" Norwood said. He mainly served as the sixth man, but none of his George Mason teammates went on to play in the NBA. Jai Lewis, their strong center, even became a member of the NFL after failing to be selected in the 2006 NBA draft. However, they defeated players like Maurice Ager, Paul Davis, Shannon Brown, Danny Green, Tyler Hansbrough, Hilton Armstrong, Josh Boone, Marcus Williams, and Rudy Gay, who were highly regarded in college and later had NBA careers. The team that eventually defeated them, the University of Florida, was led by well-known NBA players Joakim Noah, Al Horford, and Corey Brewer. \"Being able to compete against and even defeat so many future NBA players with a lineup that didn't have any NBA players is something I can always proudly talk about and remember,\" Norwood said. After finishing his NCAA career, Norwood immediately returned to the Philippines. His experience in the United States made him highly valued by the national team, and he quickly became a member of the national team's training and official roster. In 2008, he joined the Elasto Painters team as the first overall pick and has remained with the team for his 15-year career. </p> <p>In 2007, he was first selected for the national team and played in his first Jones Cup. \"At that time, I felt it was a great honor to wear the Philippines national team jersey and participate in international competitions overseas. I was valued by the coaches, went through many classic battles, and came to the Jones Cup, playing eight to nine games in a row with at most one day of rest. Every day, I experienced the impact of different countries and different basketball cultures, and every game made me feel meaningful,\" Norwood said. Please continue reading. </p> <p>Today (August 16th) is the fifth day of the tournament, and after suffering defeats in the first four days, the Philippines finally defeated Iran in double-overtime, achieving their first victory in this Jones Cup. Norwood was sent onto the court during the critical moments of the second overtime by coach Joseller Guiao to complete important defensive tasks, stopping Iran's comeback attempt. Coach Guiao highly appreciated Norwood's contribution, saying, \"He is a seasoned player with leadership abilities who fully understands what needs to be done on the court. When we needed defense during crucial moments, he was able to step up and defend. I trust him a lot.\" Although Norwood may not be the absolute mainstay player with extended playing time in this Jones Cup, he is still an indispensable veteran for the Philippines. </p> <p>Norwood has excellent physical talent, excelling in both offense and defense. He is almost a guaranteed selection for the national team, a reliable 3D player. He won silver medals with the Philippines in the 2013 and 2015 FIBA Asia Championships (now Asia Cup), achieving the team's best records and advancing to the FIBA World Cup and Olympic qualification tournaments. He has left his mark in Philippine basketball history and has not forgotten the intense battle with the Chinese Taipei team in the 2013 Asia Championships: \"I will always remember that year. We had a good performance, but we lost to Taiwan in one game. However, looking back, it was a very exciting game. We had a double-digit lead in the second half, but we were eventually overturned by a sharpshooter from the Chinese Taipei team (Lu Cheng-Ju). I believe it was a fantastic showdown where both sides gave their all. As a player, losing may be disappointing, but there is absolutely no regret,\" Norwood said.

After a three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Jones Cup has returned this year. The University of California Irvine (UCI), representing the United States, was invited to participate. Turner, who has been in charge of UCI since 2010, has once again set foot on the island. When Turner mentioned his previous visit to \"this place,\" he was referring to 27 years ago in 1996. In that year, the Jones Cup also featured a team from the United States, composed of stars from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) of the NCAA. At the time, Turner was an assistant coach at Wake Forest University and accompanied the American team to Taiwan.</p> <p>Please continue reading. Due to his previous participation in the Jones Cup, Turner has a deep understanding of the tournament's dynamics and schedule. Although it may not be a formal championship with points and official records, having teams from various Asian countries participate is still a special and meaningful challenge for NCAA teams. \"Playing 8 games in 9 days is just as intense as playing 11 games in 12 days, which was the case back then. It's a demanding schedule that puts us to the test. In mid-August, many universities in the United States have already started a new semester, but UCI is still on vacation due to scheduling arrangements, making it the perfect opportunity for us to challenge ourselves before the start of the school year.\"</p> <p>About two months before the start of the Jones Cup, UCI had already announced on the university's website that their basketball team would be participating. The NCAA allows each school to have an international program once every four years, and UCI chose the Jones Cup as their journey. \"Many people in the United States only watch American basketball,\" Turner said. \"Although the United States is undoubtedly the best basketball country in the world, basketball is not limited to one style. NCAA players need to learn about basketball with different styles, talents, and strategies from different countries in order to understand how basketball operates.\"</p> <p>Although UCI started the Jones Cup with three consecutive victories, scoring over 100 points and winning by more than 60 points each game, Turner believes that this does not mean they are a powerhouse far superior to other teams, nor does it mean that UCI considers the Jones Cup to be unchallenging. \"Many of our players are seeing how Asian teams play for the first time. In fact, teams like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates improved as the tournament went on. The content of our loss on the first day may not reflect their true strength. We just had enough manpower this time to change our strategies according to the situation on the court. We performed well in the Jones Cup, even better than I expected, and that's why we won.\"</p> <p>UCI brought 17 players to the Jones Cup this time. Turner mentioned that they usually maintain a roster of 16 players for the school team. Bringing an extra player this time was necessary to meet the depth requirements for intensive games and to adapt tactics against different countries. Among the six players above 205 centimeters, four are over 210 centimeters. Turner initially planned to have at least two of them on the court at all times, maintaining a \"twin tower\" formation. However, he changed the lineup to a formation with one big and four small players when he believed that spatial awareness and defensive presence in the paint were more important. \"My forwards also performed well and lived up to my expectations when I changed the formation. That's the best part of our performance.\"</p> <p>Over twenty years ago, Turner was an assistant coach at Wake Forest University. He then moved to Stanford from 2000 to 2004 and joined the NBA's Golden State Warriors as an assistant coach in 2004. In 2010, he left the NBA and became the head coach of UCI. For him, although the title of head coach is higher than that of an assistant coach, the educational significance that college basketball brings is more important than professional basketball.</p> <p>\"Compared to professional basketball, college coaches have a greater influence on players. College players may not be mature, but college coaches don't necessarily have to immediately help players secure better contracts. Instead, they can help them grow from boys to better men through their presence on the court. Of course, in college, I still need to help the team win. However, if I can help players become better individuals and bring more positive influences to themselves and their surroundings, that would be my achievement as a college coach.\"</p> <p>In Turner's philosophy, winning is undoubtedly important in basketball. Whether it's his original twin tower formation or the tallest starting lineup in NCAA history, which had a 7'6\" player and a 6'8\" player in the same game in 2015, Turner wants to convey to his players that basketball is not just about winning. \"When I first came to UCI, none of the players on the team were taller than me (6'7\"). We played fast, just like Asian teams. Now, I usually use two big players, and we can still win. What I want to say is that basketball will always be related to physique and skills. Having a better physique or better skills than others can give you an advantage. But the most beautiful thing on the basketball court is that there are always different ways to improve. As long as you focus on your path to success, you can make great things happen.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230821093745794049/","title":"Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, suffered his first playoff defeat against a Western Conference team in the series against the Los Angeles Lakers","text":"<p>Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, suffered his first playoff defeat against a Western Conference team in the series against the Los Angeles Lakers.

Prior to this series against the Lakers, the Warriors had a perfect record of 19 wins and 0 losses against Western Conference teams in the playoffs. This means that whenever the Warriors made it to the playoffs, they would always reach the NBA Finals and have won the championship four times.</p> <p>Despite finishing 6th in the regular season and avoiding the play-in tournament, the Warriors had a tough first-round series against the Sacramento Kings, which went to a decisive Game 7. Looking at the Warriors' core rotation, it is unlikely that they would trade their star player Stephen Curry, whose contract runs until 2026. However, Klay Thompson, one of the \"Splash Brothers,\" could potentially be a target for the team.</p> <p>According to reports from the US sports media, next year will be the last year of Thompson's contract with the Warriors, earning a salary of $43.21 million. Although the Warriors have the option to re-sign him, there are rumors that the team wants Thompson to take a pay cut.</p> <p>Furthermore, according to The Athletic, although Draymond Green has a player option for the next season, he must decide by June 30, 2023, whether to exercise it. While the Warriors are interested in re-signing Green, it is uncertain if they will offer him a max contract. If Green becomes a free agent, there are several teams interested in acquiring him.</p> <p>In addition to the main starters, Jonathan Kuminga, who only averaged 6.3 minutes per game in the series against the Lakers, expressed his desire to be traded to a team where he can have more opportunities, according to his agent.</p> <p>In the Western Conference semifinals, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the defending champions, the Golden State Warriors, with a final score of 122-101. They will now face the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers had a 3-2 advantage before the game, and they outperformed the Warriors in various aspects. LeBron James had 30 points, 9 rebounds, and 9 assists, while Anthony Davis contributed 17 points and 20 rebounds despite leaving the game due to an injury. Austin Reaves scored 23 points, shooting 4 out of 5 from three-point range, leading the Lakers throughout the game. Despite Stephen Curry's game-high 32 points, Klay Thompson struggled, and the Warriors only made 13 of their 48 three-point attempts.</p> <p>The Lakers took a slight lead of 31-26 in the first quarter and continued to dominate in the second quarter, with the Warriors struggling to find their shooting rhythm. The \"Splash Brothers,\" Curry and Thompson, only scored a combined 20 points in the first half. The Lakers, on the other hand, were led by LeBron James, who scored 15 points in the first half, including a three-pointer. Austin Reaves hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer from beyond half-court before halftime, energizing the crowd and giving the Lakers a 56-46 lead. In the second half, the Lakers extended their lead with more three-pointers from Reaves and a contribution from D'Angelo Russell.</p> <p>The Warriors, who have had a poor away record this season, struggled in the third quarter. With 6 minutes and 20 seconds remaining in the third quarter, both teams received technical fouls after a confrontation under the basket, resulting in the ejection of the Lakers' Dennis Schroder. The Lakers entered the fourth quarter with a 91-77 lead, and although the Warriors showed some improvement, Draymond Green faced foul trouble, and Rui Hachimura blocked Klay Thompson's shot. With more than 8 minutes left in the fourth quarter, there was already a 20-point difference between the teams, securing the victory for the Lakers. The 7th-seeded Lakers, who eliminated the 2nd-seeded Memphis Grizzlies in the first round, will face the top-seeded Denver Nuggets on the 17th of this month.

Fortunately, he was quickly rushed to the hospital and is now out of the intensive care unit, with no major issues.</p> <p>However, this incident may jeopardize the progress he has made so far. As the son of LeBron, Bronny has always faced more attention and pressure than the average \"baller son\". Being the \"heir apparent\" to a legendary figure in the NBA, his basketball talent is naturally scrutinized. However, compared to his father's high school days, Bronny's dominance on the court is not as remarkable. Although he still possesses good natural abilities, he has not displayed the same level of dominance as his father did in high school. At one point, he was even considered to be living in his father's shadow.</p> <p>Nevertheless, despite the harsh criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continued to improve his skills. In his senior year, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, earning a spot on the McDonald's All-American team and receiving the title of a five-star high school player from some basketball media outlets. He also received basketball scholarships from several top NCAA Division I schools. These achievements significantly raised his draft prospects, going from a potential undrafted player to someone with a chance to be selected in the first round or even in the lottery. Some may attribute this to the influence of his father's fame, as LeBron himself has stated that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, he has a high chance of joining his son's team and playing alongside him. This \"son picks father\" scenario undoubtedly had an impact on Bronny's market value, but it should not overshadow his own efforts.</p> <p>Ultimately, Bronny chose to attend the University of Southern California and intends to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. Prior to his enrollment, he posted on his social media, expressing his determination to prove his doubters wrong. However, his heart condition has cast a shadow over his upcoming college season.</p> <p>Bronny's case, where his NBA journey was hindered by a heart problem, reminds me of another \"baller son,\" Shareef O'Neal, the son of basketball star Shaquille O'Neal. During his high school years, Shareef indeed had some notable performances and was recognized as a four-star high school player by sports media. He also planned to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, a heart abnormality was discovered, which posed a high risk to his life and necessitated immediate surgery.</p> <p>The post-surgery recovery and rehabilitation forced Shareef to stay away from high-intensity competitions for a whole 11 months. This was a significant setback for a rising player since he missed out on crucial development opportunities. Coupled with Shareef's condition, which made him less dominant in the more intense NCAA games, coaches did not have the luxury of giving him much time on the court, resulting in a decline in his college performance. Ultimately, he faced the possibility of going undrafted.</p> <p>\"I always tell Shareef that he will never be the next me.\" \"I want him to play his own game, his own style.\" \"Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the O'Neal name, but he still has to create his own path,\" Shaquille said. </p> <p>Currently, Shareef is still pursuing opportunities in professional leagues. Despite averaging only 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the previous season, overcoming the shadow of his heart condition is a significant achievement. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be defined by his father's achievements and reputation but to courageously pursue his own chosen path.</p> <p>Likewise, LeBron undoubtedly views Bronny in the same way, where his draft position or any potential setbacks will not diminish the love LeBron has for his child. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by injuries and can showcase his own value in the upcoming season.</p> <p>This article, authorized by the author, was originally published here.

Artino officially joined the team and began representing Taiwan in the first and second rounds of the 2023 FIBA World Cup Asia Qualifiers and the 2022 Asia Cup. With Artino's addition, the team's strength has indeed been improved to a certain extent. However, due to the relatively short cooperation time and the differences in Artino's strengths compared to Davis, there seems to be room for improvement in Artino's integration into the team compared to Davis' first year with the team.</p> <p>Continuing to read about this year's 2023 Jones Cup, it is Artino's first time playing in Taiwan wearing the Chinese national team jersey in front of the Taiwanese people. The Jones Cup holds a special meaning for many Taiwanese basketball fans, and performing well in front of them can deepen the connection with the fans. Additionally, the intense schedule of 9 days and 8 games, facing teams with different playing styles from around the world, also helps in the integration between Artino and the Chinese men's basketball team. Continuing to read about the 2023 Jones Cup, Artino, along with his teammates Hu Jiaxiong, Lin Zhijie, Abasi, and Aba, all have different connections to Taiwan. Apart from the undefeated University of California, Irvine, the overall strength of the other countries' lineups is not as high as in previous years. Therefore, the individual performances of the players may not hold much value, and the focus will be on observing the chemistry between the players. However, Artino has indeed performed well in this year's Jones Cup. Continuing to read, in this edition of the Jones Cup, Artino played in all 8 games, averaging 26.24 minutes per game and contributing an average of 21.4 points, 10.5 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. His plus-minus value reached an impressive 14.4, and this excellent performance earned him a spot in the All-Tournament Team.</p> <p>Notably, Artino's field goal percentage for two-pointers reached an impressive 71.7%, indicating his dominance in the paint during this Jones Cup. Furthermore, he has improved in avoiding fouls, committing an average of only 1.9 fouls per game. However, there is still room for improvement in his free throw shooting, as he averaged 5.8 attempts per game but only achieved a 63% free throw percentage. Artino expressed that playing in the Jones Cup feels different from playing in professional leagues in the past, and he feels great to be able to wear the Chinese national team jersey and play in front of Taiwanese fans.</p> <p>In addition, the team's chemistry has improved compared to previous years. This year is Artino's first time training with the national team, and if Yi Jianjun can successfully return to the team, Artino believes that their team's strength will be even more complete.</p> <p>Recently becoming a father, Artino mentioned that this change in his life has given him a different perspective: \"This year, I became a father, but at the same time, I lost my own father. My father loved watching me play basketball, and I know he is now watching me from another world. I want my child to grow up in Taiwan and experience its culture. I hope that one day, he can serve the national team just like me.\"</p> <p>This year, the Chinese national team has a new coach, Coach Sam Mortensen, replacing Coach Parker, who had been coaching for many years. Regarding the adaptation to the coaching systems of the two coaches, Artino said, \"The systems of the two coaches are indeed slightly different, but I think both of them are great coaches. My job is to fulfill any tasks given by the coach. The most important job for me is to protect the paint and score for the Chinese national team as much as possible.\" From losing his father to becoming a father, this significant transformation in life has given Artino a different understanding of basketball. After settling down in Taiwan, his growing ambition and emotional investment in the game are qualities that cannot be taken away. Whether he can channel these qualities in the right direction and bring positive contributions to the team will test Artino's wisdom as he enters this new stage of life.</p>"},{"location":"20230822132252100297/","title":"Temporary Stagnation in the Eye of the Free Agent Market Storm","text":"<p>For more articles, join the \"Bulls Fans Discussion Group\" or visit the new \"AhUtopian Sports Talk\" page   Temporary Stagnation in the Eye of the Free Agent Market Storm</p> <p>For more articles, join the \"Bulls Fans Discussion Group\" or visit the new \"AhUtopian Sports Talk\" page.

It could be related to the injury exception they applied for.</p> <ol> <li>Andre Drummond's Revelation: A recent video of Drummond has been widely circulated, where he advises young players not to focus solely on statistics and complain, but rather on becoming better team players. This advice resonates with Drummond's own experience, going from a player with a multi-million-dollar contract to someone who struggled to find a team.</li> </ol> <p>Drummond's speech to young players during his time with the Bulls has been meaningful for his self-awareness and mindset, making him willing to stay with the team.</p> <p>During a period when he wasn't playing, there were rumors that Drummond faced self-doubt and questioning, and the coaching staff and organization chose to support him. If you watch the video, you can see the reasons behind the team's approach and the impact it had. It's a lesson in life and broadening perspectives.</p> <ol> <li>Signing Julian Phillips with the New CBA Second Round Exception: According to reports, the Bulls have signed Julian Phillips, the 35th overall pick in this year's draft, to a four-year contract. The contract includes team options and provides Phillips with a guaranteed amount of $5.7 million, making it the second-highest among second-round picks.</li> </ol> <p>Under the CBA, these four-year contracts with second-round picks require teams to decline the fourth-year option after the third year to make the player a restricted free agent. This is similar to previous CBA regulations. Notable cases under the previous CBA include Lu Dort, who had a successful outcome, and Jalen Brunson, whose team failed to exercise the option.</p> <ol> <li>Signing Adama Sanogo to a Two-Way Contract: The Bulls have confirmed the signing of undrafted rookie Adama Sanogo to a two-way contract. Sanogo has shown his strengths and weaknesses during the summer league, and he reminds me of Isaiah Stewart, a recently signed center for the Detroit Pistons. Stewart secured a $64 million, four-year extension with the Pistons.</li> </ol> <p>While I haven't watched Stewart's games extensively, besides his confrontation with LeBron James, his basketball IQ, development, and role have been subjects of discussion among Pistons fans. However, the Pistons evaluated him positively and provided him with an opportunity amidst competition from high-ceiling players like Marvin Bagley III and James Wiseman. Even though the market for traditional centers may be shrinking in today's game, players like Kevon Looney, Wendell Carter Jr., and Steven Adams have proven that by understanding their roles and positively impacting the game through team integration, they can still be recognized.</p> <p>Note: All references to specific social media pages and groups have been removed as per the request.</p>"},{"location":"20230822132330120684/","title":"NBA player Skal Labissiere has signed a partially guaranteed one-year contract with the Sacramento Kings, according to reporter Shams Charania","text":"<p>NBA player Skal Labissiere has signed a partially guaranteed one-year contract with the Sacramento Kings, according to reporter Shams Charania.

It is expected that Labissiere will spend most of his time in the G-League while the Kings evaluate his performance and potentially promote him to the main roster. Labissiere was selected by the Kings as the 28th overall pick in the first round of the 2016 NBA Draft. He averaged 8.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per game in his rookie season and had similar numbers the following year. However, his playing time decreased significantly after being traded to the Trail Blazers in the 2018-2019 season.

The first season depicted the rise of the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s, led by the flamboyant and charismatic owner Jerry Buss (played by John C. Reilly). The team was known for their entertaining style of play and was nicknamed Showtime.</p> <p>However, the series also portrayed the darker aspects of the glamorous era - sex, drugs - which led some of the real-life characters to publicly criticize the show for distorting reality.</p> <p>Continuing reading, how many key characters are there in the series? This includes Magic Johnson (played by Quincy Isaiah), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (played by Solomon Hughes), and coach West (played by Jason Clarke).</p> <p>Coach West even publicly demanded an apology from HBO for the distorted portrayal of his character. In the series, Magic Johnson is still portrayed as a talented and spiritual player, but much attention is given to his rampant sexuality and affairs with different women. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, still in his prime, is depicted as a washed-up, jealous, and difficult former star. As for coach West, he is constantly smashing things and using foul language, showing no signs of stability or composure. </p> <p>The second season of the Lakers dynasty's rise in the TV series trailer enters the period after Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar led the team to win the 1980 NBA championship, forming a dynasty with a new style of play and a fast-paced dominance in the NBA league. The Showtime Lakers went on to win five championships, helping the NBA grow into a multi-billion dollar sports industry.</p> <p>Continuing reading, the second season covers the period from 1980 to 1984, where the Lakers won their first championship but then faced elimination. The series explores what happens after achieving ambitions, especially why it becomes so difficult to win again after the first time. Max Borenstein says, \"You will find that those who achieve their goals will stand in front of the mirror, doubting themselves, and wondering what to do next. What is the next step?\" From 1982 onwards, the Lakers reached the NBA Finals eight out of ten years, which was an incredible era.</p> <p>However, behind the ups and downs of their performance, there are stories. In 1982, the Lakers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers led by Julius Erving, only to be swept by their old rivals in 1983.</p> <p>In 1984, the Lakers finally faced the Boston Celtics and Larry Bird (played by Sean Patrick Small) in the NBA Finals. To create dramatic storytelling, the script may not fully adhere to the actual events. Making a basketball-themed drama believable also requires a lot of effort. Producer Idan Ravin has helped with the basketball-related preparations in the past, including casting and choreography.</p> <p>The challenge is that not many actors have the same height and athleticism as NBA players, making it difficult for them to perform high-level moves.</p> <p>That's why when Idan Ravin received a call from HBO's production unit asking him to \"turn a professional actor into Magic Johnson,\" he burst out laughing.</p> <p>Idan Ravin said, \"The NBA has 400 registered players today, and none of them can become Magic Johnson, but HBO wants me to train an actor to become Magic Johnson?\" Continuing reading, Quincy Isaiah, who is 6 feet 3 inches tall, already stands out in Hollywood, but he is still 6 inches shorter than Magic Johnson. Additionally, his muscular physique from playing American football makes him look bulky on camera. Therefore, Idan Ravin helped him develop a weight loss plan to make his appearance closer to Magic Johnson. To make his basketball playing look professional, Idan Ravin had Quincy Isaiah undergo special training, especially in learning Magic Johnson's famous no-look passes, accurately bouncing the ball to his teammates.</p> <p>Executive producer and one of the writers, Rodney Barnes, said that the challenge was to present how Johnson's interactions with his teammates were dramatic, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the storyline. In the second season, Pat Riley (played by Adrien Brody) officially becomes the Lakers' head coach after his friend West is fired. This is described by Max Borenstein as a \"Shakespearean\" transformation, as if a superhero emerges, with Pat Riley's Armani suits symbolizing a cape and his hair styled with gel symbolizing a mask, coming to the rescue of the Lakers. Another key character in the series is Jeanie Buss (played by Hadley Robinson), Jerry Buss's daughter and the current owner of the Lakers.</p> <p>In reality, Jeanie Buss herself expressed her opinion on Instagram after the first season, stating that the portrayal in the series did not reflect her real life, but she commended the overall effect of the first season.</p> <p>Max Borenstein said he had a positive conversation with Jeanie Buss, and the atmosphere was pleasant.</p> <p>Rodney Barnes said, \"We are not simply making things up. Sometimes it's hard to accept that your favorite character has another side to their life, so you may consider it fake or a wrong depiction.\"</p> <p>To address this, the producers made preparations for the second season. They prepared a guide for journalists and the media, explaining the sources used in the series, including scenes from the third episode's awkward brunch and a crazy press conference scene in the fifth episode, which are based on real events. Are you a Lakers fan? Maybe you should go and watch this different portrayal of the Lakers' story.

This year was no exception, as the two teams had the same record of six wins and one loss before the game. The winner of this game would secure second place in this edition of the Jones Cup.</p> <p>The first quarter of the game was intense, with the teams evenly matched. Ateno finally shook off yesterday's gloom against the United States and scored 8 points in the paint in the first quarter. Liu Zheng, Abasi, and Lin Tingqian also contributed points, giving Team Chinese Blue a 22-18 lead. In the second quarter, Ateno continued to demonstrate his dominant presence in the paint, scoring 13 points.

Their home attendance had declined for eight consecutive seasons, with an average of 8,009 fans attending games during the 1986-87 season. They were not only the smallest market in the NBA, but San Antonio's television market was also ranked 42nd in the United States. The Spurs were at the bottom in terms of revenue, season ticket sales, and any other relevant indicators.</p> <p>The main problem was the team's performance. Since the departure of their star player \"The Iceman\" George Gervin in 1985, the Spurs, who had reached the Western Conference Finals for two consecutive years in the early 1980s (and had made it to the playoffs for 10 consecutive years in the ABA and NBA), began to decline. Their winning percentage never exceeded fifty percent. \"The team was dead,\" said McCombs.</p> <p>\"We are at a critical moment as a team,\" said Bob Bass, the general manager at the time. \"We need to do something to bring the fans back to the arena.\"</p> <p>If the Spurs hadn't been lucky enough to win the first overall pick in 1987, it is likely that the last professional sports team in San Antonio would not have stayed. McCombs recalled that NBA Commissioner David Stern told him in 1987 that the Spurs might not survive in San Antonio, and McCombs couldn't argue against it.</p> <p>However, with the first overall pick, the Spurs rewrote the basketball history of South Texas. All hope in the Alamo City was placed on a seven-foot naval officer: David Robinson.</p> <p>Typical NBA top picks usually start to shine in seventh or eighth grade, taller, faster, and better skilled than their peers. They dominate in high school, participate in high-level basketball camps, are pursued by college basketball coaches, make a name for themselves in college basketball, and become highly sought-after top picks surrounded by fans.</p> <p>But in 1987, Robinson, the consensus top pick, didn't follow the typical path. He only had one year of high school basketball experience, didn't attend basketball camps, and when he entered college, he was only 6 feet 6 inches tall and weighed 175 pounds. He attended the United States Naval Academy, and his dream was only to become a naval officer. Professional basketball was not even on his wish list.</p> <p>However, the maximum height limit for admission to the Naval Academy was 6 feet 6 inches, and Robinson grew seven inches after enrolling, instantly becoming the center of attention. He grew taller, but his coordination and speed remained outstanding. On the court, he was faster and taller than anyone else. \"I didn't even notice how fast I was growing,\" said the 7-foot-1-inch Robinson. \"I just noticed more and more people looking at me and saying, 'Man, you have to play basketball!'\"</p> <p>Approximately 5% of Naval Academy students continue to grow to 6 feet 8 inches after enrollment, but this height is still not enough to establish oneself in Division I college basketball. Moreover, the Naval Academy is not primarily a basketball school. Since 1933, no player from the Naval Academy has been selected to the All-American team.</p> <p>However, having a 7-foot giant at the Naval Academy allowed the team, led by Robinson, to become a powerhouse in the NCAA. They not only returned to the NCAA Tournament's round of 64 for the first time since 1960 but also made it to the Elite Eight, breaking the school record. Robinson also grew into a super beast, receiving transfer invitations from many colleges and becoming the highly coveted future top pick in the NBA. Getting a multi-million-dollar contract in the professional league was not a problem.</p> <p>But being at the Naval Academy raised questions about Robinson's basketball career. When asked about Robinson's weaknesses, Bob Ferry, the general manager of the Washington Bullets (now the Wizards), bluntly said, \"Yes, his weakness is that he is in the Navy.\" Because Naval Academy graduates have to serve for five years, whether Robinson should transfer to another basketball powerhouse to solve his military service issue became a headline discussion at the time.</p> <p>However, Robinson's father was a loyal navy man, which made Robinson determined to stay in the Navy, effectively blocking his path to the NBA. This caused a big controversy. However, the Navy found a win-win solution. Having Robinson stay not only proved the loyalty of a Navy man, but the perfect gentleman Robinson also became a ready-made advertising face for the military. However, his 7-foot stature still had limitations for some submarine missions. Therefore, the Navy adjusted Robinson's service period to two years, achieving a situation where everyone was happy.</p> <p>Robinson could remain loyal, and the NBA could have the next generation of centers. For the Spurs, who were in dire straits both on and off the court at the time, having the opportunity to choose Robinson in the lottery was a godsend for the entire team. Robinson not only played the crucial center position in the NBA at the time but also excelled off the court. He scored 1320 on the SAT, majored in mathematics at the Naval Academy, and was talented in music and computers. Besides basketball, he also dabbled in gymnastics, bowling, golf, taekwondo, and tennis, and was known for being humble and easygoing.</p>"},{"location":"20230822132459881258/","title":"Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, suffered his first playoff defeat against a Western Conference team as they were eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the series with a 2-4 score","text":"<p>Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, suffered his first playoff defeat against a Western Conference team as they were eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the series with a 2-4 score. This loss could potentially lead to a restructuring of the Warriors' roster in the upcoming years.</p> <p>Steve Kerr, who is 57 years old, has been coaching the Warriors since the 2014-15 season. Prior to this series against the Lakers, the Warriors had a perfect 19-0 record in the playoffs against Western Conference teams. This means that whenever the Warriors made it to the playoffs, they would always reach the NBA Finals and have won the championship four times. Despite finishing sixth in the regular season, the Warriors had to battle until the seventh game against the Sacramento Kings, a team making their first playoff appearance, to advance.</p> <p>Looking at the Warriors' main rotation, it is unlikely that they would trade their star player Stephen Curry, whose contract runs until 2026. However, Klay Thompson, one of the \"Splash Brothers,\" is a possible target for the team. According to reports from US sports media, Thompson will be in his final year of contract next year with a salary of $43.21 million. Although the Warriors have the option to extend his contract, there have been rumors that the team wants Thompson to take a pay cut. Additionally, Draymond Green, although having a player option for the next season, must decide whether to execute it before June 30, 2023. While the Warriors are interested in re-signing him, it is uncertain whether they would offer him a maximum contract. If Green becomes a free agent, there are several teams interested in acquiring him. Besides the three main starters, Jonathan Kuminga, who only averaged 6.3 minutes per game in the series against the Lakers, has expressed his desire to be traded to a team that will give him more opportunities.</p> <p>In the Western Conference Semifinals of the NBA playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the defending champions, the Golden State Warriors, with a final score of 122-101. The Lakers will now face the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers had a 3-2 advantage going into the game, and they outperformed the Warriors in various aspects. LeBron James scored 30 points, grabbed 9 rebounds, and had 9 assists, while Anthony Davis contributed 17 points and 20 rebounds, despite suffering a head injury in the game against Kevon Looney. Austin Reaves scored 23 points, making 4 out of 5 three-pointers, contributing to the Lakers' dominant performance throughout the game.</p> <p>On the Warriors' side, Andrew Wiggins, who had a rib injury, played in the game, and Stephen Curry scored a game-high 32 points. However, Klay Thompson struggled, and the team's three-point shooting, usually a strong suit, only made 13 out of 48 attempts. The Lakers led by a small margin of 31-26 after the first quarter. In the second quarter, the Warriors continued to struggle with their three-point shooting, making only 5 out of 23 attempts in the first half. Curry and Thompson combined for only 20 points in the first half.</p> <p>LeBron James scored 15 points in the first half, including three-pointers. Before the end of the first half, Austin Reaves made a buzzer-beating three-pointer, giving the Lakers a 56-46 lead. In the second half, Reaves continued to make three-pointers, and D'Angelo Russell also contributed, extending the Lakers' lead to double digits.</p> <p>With a 91-77 lead going into the fourth quarter, the Lakers maintained their advantage. The Warriors showed some improvement in the fourth quarter, but Draymond Green faced foul trouble, and Rui Hachimura blocked Klay Thompson's shot. With over 8 minutes remaining in the game, there was already a 20-point difference between the two teams.</p> <p>As the Warriors struggled on the road this season, their morale was shaken. With 6 minutes and 20 seconds left in the third quarter, both teams received technical fouls due to a collision under the basket, and Lakers' starter Dennis Schroder was ejected from the game.</p> <p>The Lakers entered the fourth quarter with a 91-77 lead, and the Warriors could only make a slight comeback. Draymond Green faced foul trouble, while the Lakers' Rui Hachimura blocked Klay Thompson. With over 8 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, there was already a 20-point difference between the two teams, sealing the Lakers' victory. The seventh seed in the Western Conference, the Lakers defeated the second seed Memphis Grizzlies in the first round and then eliminated the defending champions Warriors in the second round. They will face the top-seeded Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals, creating a rare occurrence in this year's NBA playoffs where both the Eastern and Western Conference Finals feature the seventh or eighth seed.</p> <p>In the earlier game, the eighth seed Miami Heat eliminated the New York Knicks, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals.</p>"},{"location":"20230822132526274485/","title":"SBL2023 Rookie Draft Results Announced with 11 Players Selected, the Most in the SBL","text":"<p>The SBL held its 2023 Rookie Draft today, selecting a total of 11 players, the highest number among all leagues    SBL2023 Rookie Draft Results Announced with 11 Players Selected, the Most in the SBL</p> <p>The SBL held its 2023 Rookie Draft today, selecting a total of 11 players, the highest number among all leagues.

If you're interested in legal and business collaborations, go to [Yuyu Lawyer - Yu Zongming]. </p> <p>The \"Just down the bull's head but up the heart\" series focuses on players who have recently left the Chicago Bulls and moved to other teams. The first article in this series discussed Lauri Markkanen and was completed last September. I am delighted that he has validated my belief in him during his time with the Utah Jazz. Now, let's talk about Wendell Carter Jr., who was traded to the Orlando Magic as part of the Nikola Vucevic trade.</p> <p>But the discussion points I want to focus on are not just about the success or failure of this trade, as his current performance along with Franz Wagner can already determine that. Nor is it about WCJ's development with the Magic, as I do not have enough knowledge to provide a better judgment on that. What I want to discuss is whether the Bulls had better options at the time, even in hindsight. </p> <ul> <li>The trade dilemma caused by developmental issues Is it all his fault? Before discussing Wendell Carter Jr.'s trade, let's take a look at WCJ when he was traded and WCJ in the Orlando Magic. Can they be compared? To put it bluntly, when the Chicago Bulls traded WCJ, many Bulls fans disliked his on-court performance and felt that the 7th overall pick was wasted.</li> </ul> <p>When I say \"many Bulls fans,\" it means that it wasn't my view at the time. I believe WCJ did face challenges and difficulties, but it included factors such as coaching and team composition, not just his individual abilities.</p> <p>At this point, I want to discuss something. A phenomenon is often caused by various factors and effects to different extents. For example, when we mentioned earlier that WCJ couldn't overcome the coaching and team composition issues, we are not saying that the player has no ability to solve it autonomously or that the player doesn't need to take responsibility. We need to consider to what extent and under what circumstances the player should be held accountable. The reason I bring up this concept is that we need to discuss who should be held responsible for WCJ's challenges, and many people believe it is Jim Boylen. But when I say \"many people,\" it means I have some differing views.</p> <ul> <li>Not knowing what happened before the problems arose I don't know the age range of friends here, but do you remember a character named Wang Yuyan in Jin Yong's novels? She didn't possess martial arts skills herself, but she had a deep understanding of martial arts, and through her guidance, she could greatly enhance the effectiveness of her allies in battles.</li> </ul> <p>In NBA games, occasionally, there are players with similar qualities. Their unique skills and talents, coupled with their understanding of the game, always allow them to unite their teammates and bring out performances that surpass their individual talents.</p> <p>To put it in less martial arts terms, they possess the effects of a \"Glue Guy\" and a catalyst. On one hand, they bring together many individual and team aspects of the game, and on the other hand, they catalyze better chemistry on the court. So if you find such a rare player, wouldn't you want to maximize their qualities in your team composition? Good and lucky examples are Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Poor examples are Lonzo Ball and Otto Porter Jr. from the Chicago Bulls. As for OPJ, besides his recent role as an important bench player for the Golden State Warriors in the 2021-22 season, does he possess the unique qualities I mentioned to the same extent? In OPJ's performance after being traded from the Washington Wizards to the Bulls in the 2018-19 season, he achieved the following statistics:  - Points: 17.5 - Rebounds: 5.5 - Assists: 2.7 - Steals: 1.2 - Blocks: 0.6 - Shooting percentages: 48.3/48.8/90.6 - Average 2.6 three-pointers made per game</p> <p>To describe it qualitatively, at that time, OPJ was a versatile forward who could defend from the wing to the rim, act as a secondary defender, and serve as a defensive leader. On the offensive end, he had ball-handling skills, transition playmaking abilities, the ability to space the floor, and a high shooting accuracy, both in pull-up and catch-and-shoot situations.</p>"},{"location":"20230823100629136207/","title":"Review of the Top Keywords in June 2022: Warriors Win NBA Championship, BTS Announces Solo Careers without Disbanding","text":"<p>In just one more week, 2022 will come to an end    Review of the Top Keywords in June 2022: Warriors Win NBA Championship, BTS Announces Solo Careers without Disbanding</p> <p>In just one more week, 2022 will come to an end.

As seen in the chart, many keywords were related to the NBA due to the NBA Finals taking place this month.</p> <p>The NBA Finals featured a competition between the Warriors and the Celtics. In the end, on June 17th, the Golden State Warriors won with a score of 4-2, making NBA the most popular keyword of the day. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 in Taiwan had passed its peak, and the daily number of confirmed cases continued to decline.</p> <p>However, there was concern about Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which could appear in children about a month after being diagnosed with COVID-19. The Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center announced the number of MIS-C cases and related information during their daily press conferences. During this wave of the pandemic, a tragic incident occurred in New Taipei City where a child may have passed away due to delayed medical treatment. The child's father believes that the city government should take responsibility, and the investigation into this incident is still ongoing.</p> <p>Another popular keyword in June was \"Amazon Rainforest,\" which appeared on May 24th. This keyword trended not because of any local events related to the Amazon Rainforest, but because someone discovered that Google Maps displayed incorrect photos for locations in the Amazon Rainforest. Instead of showing photos related to the rainforest, it displayed explicit photos of a couple in a bathroom, leading to a surge in search volume. In terms of finance and economics, Bitcoin experienced a significant drop this month, falling below $20,000 and returning to its price from the end of 2020. The cryptocurrency market faced a harsh winter.</p> <p>On the 16th, the Federal Reserve announced a three-digit interest rate hike to combat inflation, which was the first time in 28 years for the United States. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen continued to depreciate, reaching a new low in 20 years. As a result, both Bitcoin and interest rate hikes became hot search terms.</p> <p>In terms of entertainment and cultural news, the release of \"Jurassic World: Dominion\" and the free availability of the game \"Among Us\" were trending keywords. Additionally, the exhibition \"Hell and Ghosts of Asia\" at the Tainan Art Museum gained popularity on social media, particularly the section featuring zombies, making the museum a trending keyword. In society, earthquakes and typhoons remained topics of interest. On June 16th, a fire in Hsinchu resulted in the death of eight family members and one injury.

In late March 2023, when the Lakers were still seeking a playoff spot, I wrote an essay called \"Peak Essays\" about the rise and excellent performance of Austin Reaves, a white shooting guard known as AR15. Please continue reading. Reaves has been in the spotlight in Los Angeles, playing for the prestigious Lakers, and news and various comments about him have never stopped.</p> <p>In an anonymous NBA player poll before the end of the season, Reaves was selected as one of the most overrated and underrated players.</p> <p>His career started with going undrafted, which made him underrated (although later it was proven that it was deliberately planned by Reaves' camp). In his second season, he became a key player for the Lakers, which may have led to him being overrated (perhaps due to his skin color), leaving Reaves' true value and abilities shrouded in mystery. Former NBA player Rashad McCants said on a podcast that Reaves was overhyped simply because he is a white player on the Lakers and happened to rise up when the Lakers had many injured players. Who is McCants? He is a notable figure in college basketball, a scoring guard with explosive athleticism, and a product of the prestigious University of North Carolina, where he won a championship and was selected 14th overall by the Timberwolves in 2005.</p> <p>However, limited by his playing style and physique, McCants is a glaring example of a college scoring guard who failed to transition successfully.</p> <p>After his four-year rookie contract expired, he couldn't secure a second contract and couldn't make a name for himself in Europe either. He could only play in weaker leagues, and his professional career had nothing noteworthy. It's reasonable to say that McCants is bitter about not being able to taste the grapes, especially considering that Reaves has indeed received more opportunities.</p> <p>However, opportunities must be seized in order to make an impact. Otherwise, the Linsanity phenomenon wouldn't have been so precious. Please continue reading. Is Reaves overrated or underrated? Judging from his performance in the latter part of the season and throughout the playoffs, I personally believe that Reaves is without a doubt the real deal, at least a qualified starter. At just 25 years old, he still has room for improvement.</p> <p>If we say that regular season performance has limited reference value, then what about the intensity of the playoffs? Reaves' performance in the play-in tournament was average, but he shone brighter in the playoffs.</p> <p>In his first-ever playoff journey, Reaves started in all 16 games, playing over 36 minutes per game and averaging 17 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 4.6 assists with only 1.6 turnovers per game.</p> <p>His performance dipped in the second round, but he bounced back strongly in the Western Conference Finals, averaging over 20 points per game with an impressive shooting percentage, solidifying his role as the Lakers' third option after LeBron James and Anthony Davis.</p> <p>After the season ended, he was selected to represent the national team in the Basketball World Cup, continuing to write a remarkable chapter. Steve Kerr, coach of the USA national team and also the coach of the Golden State Warriors, the Lakers' opponent in the second round, said, \"Based on Reaves' performance in the Western Conference playoffs, it's an easy decision to choose him.\" International games value physicality, shooting, and on-court decision-making abilities. They hope that the primary ball handler can also possess the skills of shooting, cutting, and passing, as well as the ability to defend multiple positions without being exploited.</p> <p>Reaves possesses all these abilities and has a high understanding of the game, making his selection for the national team not accidental. Former Lakers teammate, now playing for the Philadelphia 76ers, Patrick Beverley, praised Reaves on his personal podcast, saying, \"What makes Reaves impressive is his basketball IQ, but he has been underestimated because of his appearance. From my experience playing with him, Reaves has a great understanding of the game, which is why he frequently gets to the free-throw line.\"</p> <p>In the NBA, there are two types of players who can get to the free-throw line in large numbers. One is those who possess incredible athleticism and physicality to dunk over opponents, and the other is those who are extremely smart.</p> <p>It's obvious that Reaves belongs to the second category. Reaves' abilities are well recognized by those in the basketball community, but due to his status as a restricted free agent, he didn't receive much interest in the market. With only two years of experience, he had no salary cap space to work with on the Lakers, so he had to settle for an early bird exception contract, signing a 4-year, $56 million contract with a player option in the fourth year, along with a 15% trade kicker. This contract is clearly lower than his market value, considering that Jordan Poole, who has a slightly stronger offensive firepower but weaker organization and defense, signed a 4-year, $128 million contract, and Miami Heat guard Tyler Herro signed a 4-year, $120 million contract, making Reaves' contract a steal for the Lakers. In recent years, NBA salaries have risen rapidly, and a young, high-quality starter is expected to earn at least $20 million per year, so Reaves' salary falls below his production. Whether it's with the Lakers or in the upcoming World Cup, Reaves plays a similar role.</p> <p>Offensively, he mainly serves as a playmaker, occasionally initiating pick-and-rolls, and can make quick decisions when time is running out. He can switch between on-ball and off-ball roles, has a low turnover rate, and poses a threat from the perimeter. Defensively, Reaves is willing to fight and compete, making him a valuable asset for coaches. In preseason games, there were scenes where three guards were on the court at the same time. When Reaves first entered the league, he earned playing time through his defense, fearlessly guarding top guards like Ja Morant and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He also received praise from his fellow Lakers alum and defensive stalwart, Alex Caruso, who went from being undrafted to earning a big contract. In the recent playoff journey, Reaves didn't neglect his defense, especially when he chased after the Warriors' Splash Brothers in the second round, and even his shooting was affected in the later stages of the series.</p>"},{"location":"20230823100748742203/","title":"Video: NBABruceBrown believes the toughest series was against the Timberwolves, not the Lakers","text":"<p>Video: NBABruceBrown believes the toughest series was against the Timberwolves, not the Lakers.

There are still some players who are worth a salary above the starter level, although they may not be superstars. They possess both a high ceiling and practical skills, and they are still lingering in the free agent market. Considering that there are at least two big names, James Harden and Damian Lillard, with the latter still searching for a solution, it may be difficult for the teams directly involved to complete a fair trade. Therefore, discussions should focus on how each team can predict the direction and directly or indirectly benefit their own team in this chess game. It feels like a temporary lull in the eye of the storm.</p> <p>Please continue reading. So, what can the Bulls do to join the battle? It may be related to the injury exception they applied for.</p> <p>Further reading: \"Season Summary,\" \"Bulls' Draft Day,\" \"Bulls' Free Agency Market,\" \"Bulls' Free Agency Market Initial Stage,\" \"Opinions on Other Teams' Free Agency Market Operations.\" Please continue reading.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Andre Drummond's Revelation: A recent video has been circulating wildly, featuring Drummond advising young players not to focus solely on statistics and complain, but rather on how to become a better team player. He shares his own experience of going from a player with a multi-million dollar contract to someone who is ignored. This speech to young players truly resonates. His year with the Chicago Bulls has been a meaningful one in terms of self-awareness and mindset, which is why he is willing to stay. If you remember, there was a period when he wasn't playing, and many people were criticizing the coach for freezing him out. However, it was later revealed that during that time, Drummond was questioning himself psychologically, and the coaching staff and team chose to support him through it. If you watch this video and still can't understand why the current coaching staff and coach have taken this path, and what the results are, then I truly believe that it is a matter of life experience and perspective.</p> </li> <li> <p>Signing Julian Phillips with the New CBA Second Round Exception: According to reports, the Chicago Bulls have signed Phillips, the 35th overall pick this year, to a four-year contract: 2023-24/1.6M, 2024-25/1.9M, 2025-26/2.2M, 2026-27/2.4M (Team Option). I initially thought this was part of the mid-level exception used to sign contracts, but after being reminded by netizens, it should be a standard contract under the new CBA for second-round picks. It is evident that the team values this rookie, as they have guaranteed him $5.7M, which is the second-highest among second-round picks. According to CBA rules, with this four-year contract signed by a second-round pick, the team must waive the fourth-year contract after the third year to make the player a restricted free agent. This is similar to the previous CBA regulations. The most famous recent cases under the previous CBA were the successful operations by the team to secure Lu Dort and the failed attempts with Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo, who claimed to have no emotional connection with their college teammate Jalen Brunson.</p> </li> <li> <p>Signing Adama Sanogo to a Two-Way Contract: The Chicago Bulls have confirmed the signing of undrafted player Sanogo to a two-way contract. This rookie has shown both strengths and weaknesses in the current summer league. However, he reminds me of Detroit Pistons' Isaiah Stewart, who recently signed a 4-year, $64M contract extension with the Pistons. I haven't watched Stewart play much, except for the incident where he directly confronted LeBron James. Of course, I am aware of the discussions within the Pistons' community regarding his basketball intelligence, skill development, and role. However, it seems that at least within the Pistons organization, he has been given recognition and secured a place for himself amid competition from high-ceiling players like Marvin Bagley III and James Wiseman.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Even though the modern style of play seems to be shrinking the market for this type of center, players like Kevon Looney, Wendell Carter Jr., and even Steven Adams have proven with their performances that even if they don't possess the talent or basketball awareness of Jaren Jackson Jr. or Draymond Green, they are willing to integrate into the team, understand each teammate's movements, and do what needs to be done to positively impact the game.</p>"},{"location":"20230823100838970781/","title":"Proud of the Li family: NBA player Kyle Anderson named Li Kai'er becomes the first naturalized basketball player in China","text":"<p>On the 24th, the Chinese Basketball Association announced that Kyle Anderson, who currently plays for the NBA's Timberwolves, has officially become a Chinese citizen, becoming China's first naturalized foreign basketball player   Proud of the Li family: NBA player Kyle Anderson named Li Kai'er becomes the first naturalized basketball player in China</p> <p>On the 24th, the Chinese Basketball Association announced that Kyle Anderson, who currently plays for the NBA's Timberwolves, has officially become a Chinese citizen, becoming China's first naturalized foreign basketball player. He also announced on social media that he will wear the Chinese national team jersey to participate in the FIBA Basketball World Cup in August.</p> <p>Kyle Anderson was born in Fairview, New Jersey, USA. In the 2014 NBA Draft, he was selected by the Spurs in the first round as the 30th pick and played for them for 4 years.</p> <p>He has played for the Spurs, Grizzlies, and Timberwolves throughout his career. Anderson is 206 cm tall and weighs 104 kg. He has an impressive wingspan of 220 cm. In the previous season, he played 69 games for the Timberwolves, averaging 9.4 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.9 blocks per game. He also had a three-point shooting percentage of 41% and a field goal percentage of 50.9%.</p> <p>In international competitions, Anderson has previously participated in the USA U16 and U17 training camps but has never represented the USA in games. This qualification aligns with FIBA's requirements for naturalized players, giving him the opportunity to switch nationalities and play for China. Anderson's connection to China comes from his maternal ancestry. His great-grandfather was a Chinese immigrant, giving him one-eighth Chinese heritage.</p> <p>Five years ago in 2018, he traveled to China with his mother to explore his roots and left the name Li Kai'er on his family's genealogy. It was then that news spread about the Chinese Basketball Association actively targeting Anderson as a naturalized player. After announcing his Chinese citizenship on the 24th, Anderson shared his journey of becoming a Chinese citizen on Weibo under the account name \"Big Hammer Li Kai'er.\" He recalled that the root-seeking trip in 2018 was very important to him, as it showed him where his roots lie and how deep they are. He also expressed pride and honor in having his name written in the Li family genealogy.</p> <p>He also announced on social media that he will represent the Chinese national team in the upcoming FIBA Basketball World Cup in August.</p> <p>With Anderson becoming Li Kai'er, he becomes China's first naturalized basketball player. This not only involves a change in China's basketball style but also accelerates the transformation of Chinese basketball.</p> <p>Sports commentator Li Yishen believes that Anderson is an all-around player who can handle the ball, control the game, and pass effectively. He has a high basketball IQ and can activate China's inside game with his height and playmaking ability. Especially since China lacks sufficient power and defensive presence in the inside, Anderson's addition can help the tall players in the team by creating space, organizing plays, and creating scoring opportunities.</p> <p>However, Anderson's joining also brings concerns. Although he comes from the NBA, he does not possess the explosive athleticism or one-on-one scoring ability commonly seen in international competitions. It remains to be seen whether Anderson's unique playing style and slower pace can fit into China's basketball system. Li Yishen believes that Anderson is not the solution for the Chinese men's basketball team. Although he is unique, he is not an NBA superstar who can dominate major opponents in Asia by relying solely on ball handling, superhuman drives, and individual scoring. China needs top-level coaches and has room for improvement in player skills, physical training systems, and more.</p> <p>[Join Key Opinion Leaders website] Receive exciting articles directly in your inbox every day, exclusive selections from editors, current affairs, and arts and culture reports in weekly newsletters.

Subsequently, the Los Angeles Lakers turned a closely contested game into an easy away victory.</p> <p>Shortly after, a similar scene played out in Milwaukee, with Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo lying on the court in pain, clutching his back.</p> <p>Without Antetokounmpo, the Bucks also lost the chance to win their first game of the series.</p> <p>Morant and Antetokounmpo, the two star players of their respective teams, share a commonality in addition to their injuries: the way they got injured.</p> <p>Both Morant and Antetokounmpo fell hard after drives, with defenders trying to create offensive fouls. Anthony Davis successfully blocked Morant, while Kevin Love was called for a foul, sending Antetokounmpo to the free-throw line. With star players spending less and less time on the court, the league needs to start thinking about how to get them on the court more.</p> <p>In addition to raising the threshold for awards, another issue worth discussing is whether the penalties after fouls are enough to protect players from unnecessary injuries caused by dangerous landings.</p> <p>Although Morant and Antetokounmpo were both absent from the following second game, they did not suffer career-ending injuries and returned to play in their respective series. However, we have seen many promising young stars whose careers were cut short due to injuries, so avoiding the next player with a similar experience has become a top priority. The most extreme possibility is to prohibit any help defenders from creating offensive fouls, an idea proposed by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban in his personal blog in 2004.</p> <p>Cuban acknowledges that the Mavericks have done well in creating offensive fouls, and players who are willing to endure physical pain for defensive purposes deserve praise, but he believes that this rule is \"terrifying\" for the NBA. In his article, he mentioned that \"it not only exposes both players to the risk of injury, but also weakens some of the most exciting and watchable performances in basketball.\"</p> <p>Players no longer focus on launching spectacular and incredible shots towards the basket, but instead keep their heads down, looking to see if someone will try to block them by creating offensive fouls.</p> <p>It is worth noting that this proposal does not reduce the blocks made by primary defenders to prevent players like Antetokounmpo from attacking the rim. According to ESPN Stats &amp; Info, he committed 233 ball-handler charging offensive fouls in the past 10 seasons, and those were only against opponents who tried to stop him from driving to the basket.</p> <p>Furthermore, even if players can knock down help defenders without being called for traveling, NBA rules also prohibit players from making \"non-basketball contact\" outside the concept of their body cylinder, meaning that intentionally pushing or shoving against help defenders is not allowed. However, in this era where offensive efficiency is higher than ever, such changes seem to favor the offense too much.</p> <p>When Cuban proposed in 2004, offensive efficiency was at its lowest, so they had to find ways to make offensive players more advantageous.</p> <p>The league's average offensive efficiency in the 2003-04 season was 101.4 points per 100 possessions.</p> <p>This season, that number has risen to 114.1. It is commendable that long before Morant was born, the NBA already had a rule aimed at preventing player injuries, which is the \"restricted area\" under the basket, and since the 1997-98 season, the restricted area has been expanded to its current size (four feet in diameter). The NBA was the first league to introduce the restricted area, and later the NCAA and FIBA also adopted this rule.</p> <p>However, since the implementation of this rule 26 years ago, the game has undergone significant changes.</p> <p>Back then, the offensive range was much smaller than it is now. In the 1997-98 season, only 16% of shots came from three-pointers, while this season, the proportion of three-point attempts has reached 39%.</p> <p>With the increasing popularity of long-distance three-pointers, the average shooting distance has also continued to increase. According to ESPN's statistics, in the 1997-98 season, the average distance of jump shots outside the paint was 18.4 feet (excluding logo shots), while this season, the average shooting distance outside the paint is 22.8 feet, an increase of more than 4 feet compared to the past. The expanded offensive space requires defenders to cover more area, which means they are more likely to actively move to their legal defensive positions when the ball handler takes off from outside the paint. According to the rules, this \"delayed establishing\" defensive action is prohibited.</p> <p>If defenders try to block offensive players by creating offensive fouls, they are \"not allowed to move into the path of the offensive player when he starts his upward shooting motion.\"</p> <p>In other words, as long as the offensive player takes off to attack the basket after receiving the ball, the defender cannot try to step into a position outside the restricted area to create an offensive foul. This is the reason why Love's defense against Antetokounmpo was called a foul. However, in reality, it is difficult for referees to accurately judge the defender's position and the timing of the offensive player's takeoff. Therefore, whether the defender is inside the restricted area often becomes the main criterion for distinguishing between blocking fouls and offensive fouls, which is why Cuban advocates for increasing the radius of the restricted area to five feet.</p> <p>This suggestion was not haphazardly proposed. As early as 2006, Cuban publicly suggested expanding the restricted area to cover the entire paint. If the restricted area were larger, Morant's injury case would be regarded as a foul by Davis, and Davis would not attempt to create an offensive foul in the first place.</p> <p>Instead, Davis may focus on preparing to block Morant's shot - something he is good at, as he contributed a total of seven blocks on Sunday, repeatedly thwarting the Grizzlies' attacks.</p>"},{"location":"20230825055642459996/","title":"T1 League Secretary-General is taken over by Wang Zhiqun, who is expected to create more benefits for the league based on his own experience","text":"<p>T1 League Secretary-General is taken over by Wang Zhiqun, who is expected to create more benefits for the league based on his own experience.</p> <p>T1 Taiwan Sports Lottery x T1 League made organizational adjustments in the offseason, and the position of Secretary-General will be taken over by former Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Basketball Association, Wang Zhiqun.</p> <p>The new Secretary-General will enter the league with the advantage of multiple roles in the past, including the experience of operating teams in order to strengthen communication channels between the league and teams.

Today, legislator Lin Wei-zhou specially held a press conference to express concerns and stated that T1 League newcomer Taishin Bank is the team behind the poaching of Lin Ping-sheng. After Attack Lions officially announced Lin Ping-sheng's joining, he contradicted it on his personal social media, announcing his refusal to join. Today, the Attack Lions team also held a press conference with legislator Lin Wei-zhou, during which consultant Chen Zhi-zhong mentioned that Lin Ping-sheng had approached Attack Lions on May 25 expressing his willingness to join. After reaching a consensus, Attack Lions informed New Taipei CTBC Attack Team, with whom Lin Ping-sheng had a contract at the time. CTBC Attack also requested a quote from Attack Lions before deciding whether to match it, and later Attack Lions successfully signed a contract with Lin Ping-sheng. Chen Zhi-zhong also revealed that in late May and early June, Lin Ping-sheng had contract issues with a Chinese basketball team, which prevented him from being available for national team selection. At that time, he asked Attack Lions for help in resolving the issue, \"This also shows that he recognizes himself as a member of Attack Lions. Two weeks ago, he told us that he wants to wear the number 3 jersey, and we discussed with Wang Zi-gang to give it to him, which shows that Attack Lions welcomes him with open arms. I don't know why he suddenly wants to go to other teams these past two weeks.\"</p> <p>Representative Hu Long-zhi of Attack Lions Cultural and Creative Co., Ltd. stated that during the period after Lin Ping-sheng signed the contract, both parties continued to add to the contract content. Even when he expressed his desire to join the CBA, we were still making adjustments. However, later he expressed that he didn't want to join, and they couldn't actively approach Taishin Bank since the contract was signed with Attack Lions. \"Of course, we still hope to resolve this through negotiation rather than filing a lawsuit. We judge players based on their performance on the court, and we can teach them off the court. This is the principle we uphold.\" Legislator Lin Wei-zhou also revealed that it is understood that it was Taishin Financial Holding that signed the contract with Lin Ping-sheng. He also faced some pressure before this press conference, hoping that he wouldn't hold it. \"Malicious poaching is not regulated. PLG has its own regulations, and T1 also has its own regulations, but the other league's malicious poaching is not subject to PLG regulations, which is not very healthy for the development of both leagues and basketball. The team plays in the season, and halfway through, they are poached. I'll compensate you for the damages as long as you can pay, you'll be poached. What can we do?\"</p>"},{"location":"20230825055724136190/","title":"Jones Cup: Chinese Blue Team Scores Over 100 Points, Easily Defeats UAE","text":"<p>The Chinese Blue Team, who had a day off, faced the United Arab Emirates (UAE) today   Jones Cup: Chinese Blue Team Scores Over 100 Points, Easily Defeats UAE</p> <p>The Chinese Blue Team, who had a day off, faced the United Arab Emirates (UAE) today. Before the game, the UAE presented gifts to the audience, causing a commotion. However, this did not affect the good condition of the Chinese team.

In addition to the shocking Bradley Beal trade, they have signed Drew Eubanks, Keita Bates-Diop (KBD), Chimezie Metu, Yuta Watanabe, and Eric Gordon in free agency. They have also reached contract extensions with Josh Okogie and Damion Lee. After finalizing their roster for the upcoming season, the Suns have made some adjustments through signings and trades. They first sent backup point guard Cam Payne along with a second-round pick to the Spurs in exchange for a protected future second-round pick. They then acquired 23-year-old forward Bol Bol, who was recently released by the Magic. They also made a trade involving draft rights with the Magic.</p> <p>Bol Bol, like the previous acquisitions of Eubanks, KBD, Metu, and Watanabe, is a versatile forward who can play multiple positions in the frontcourt. However, he stands out as a unique player due to his exceptional physical attributes. Standing at 7 feet 2 inches (approximately 218 cm) with a wingspan of 7 feet 8 inches (approximately 234 cm), Bol possesses remarkable athleticism and skill set. His physical stature and skill package bear some resemblance to this year's top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama, who stands at 7 feet 4 inches (approximately 224 cm) with a wingspan of 7 feet 10 inches (approximately 240 cm). As a result, Bol has been dubbed the \"original version of Wembanyama\" by some.</p> <p>Bol had his best season yet in the NBA while playing for the Magic. He appeared in 70 games and averaged 9.1 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game, all of which were career highs. However, his performance showed some inconsistency throughout the season. In the first two and a half months, Bol played 37 games, with 32 of them as a starter, averaging 26.1 minutes per game. During this period, he contributed 12.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, and a shooting percentage of 58.8%. However, as injured players like Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, and Jalen Suggs returned to the Magic's lineup in 2023, Bol's playing time and opportunities diminished. In the remaining 33 games, he started only once and saw his minutes reduced by 10. As a result, his averages dropped to 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds per game. The most significant impact of the unstable playing time on Bol was seen in his three-point shooting consistency. In the first two and a half months, he had a catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage of 38.1%, but after 2023 began, it plummeted to a dismal 8.6%.</p> <p>However, when examining advanced statistics, Bol's uniqueness becomes apparent. His height and smooth touch around the basket make him difficult to defend during cuts to the basket, ranking him in the top 5% of the league in efficiency in this aspect. Additionally, his height combined with his wingspan gives him an advantage in grabbing offensive rebounds, with his put-back efficiency also ranking in the top 5% of the league.</p> <p>Furthermore, Bol's excellent ball-handling skills allow him to initiate his own drives and push the ball up the court. This enables him to make decisions based on defensive alignments, either attacking the basket or taking a quick stop-and-pop jumper from beyond the three-point line. His contribution in offensive transition plays accounted for 27.6% of his overall offensive involvement last season, ranking him 15th in the league and higher than any other player on the Suns' roster.</p> <p>Unlike most tall players who primarily serve as screeners in pick-and-roll situations, Bol, with his versatile ball-handling skills, can also handle the ball in those scenarios. The trend of positionless basketball in the league has made it common for big men to handle the ball, while guards and forwards set screens. Nikola Joki\u0107, for example, frequently initiates the Invert P&amp;R. However, the percentage of plays involving a pick-and-roll ball handler accounts for only 5.1% of the total offensive involvement. Bol, on the other hand, has a staggering 8.6% involvement in such plays, making him the number one among 7-footers in the league.</p> <p>In summary, Bol possesses all-around abilities in shooting, cutting, and passing, making him a valuable asset for the coaching staff's tactical adjustments on offense. However, his impact on the defensive end may not be as significant. Despite his height of over 7 feet (approximately 213 cm), his slender build limits his effectiveness. Within a 6-foot (approximately 183 cm) radius of the basket, his defensive differential percentage was only 1.1%. In other words, when matched up against Bol, opponents' shooting percentages near the basket not only don't decrease but actually increase by 1.1%. This places him in the bottom seven among all 7-footers in the league.</p>"},{"location":"20230825055806700044/","title":"Is Stephen Curry the greatest point guard of all time?

Carter, known for his explosive dunks, is famous worldwide for his memorable \"Death Dunk\" over Weis, a 218cm tall French center, during the 2000 Olympics. His elbow-in-the-rim dunk in the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest is also a classic moment. Carter is the first player in history to have played in four decades, from the 1990s to the 2020s. He has been selected as an All-Star eight times, made the All-NBA Team twice, named the Player of the Month three times, and was the Rookie of the Year in 1999. Throughout his NBA career, Carter played in 1541 games and achieved impressive averages of 16.7 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 3.1 assists. He is highly regarded as a potential Hall of Fame inductee in 2024. </p> <p>Crawford is famous for his flashy dribbling skills and is hailed by fans as \"J.Crossover\" for his unique \"Shake and Bake\" moves. After being selected as the 8th overall pick in the first round of the 2000 NBA Draft, Crawford primarily played as a starter in the early stages of his career. However, after joining the Atlanta Hawks in 2009, he mostly served as the team's sixth man. Despite the drastic change in his role, Crawford not only accepted it without complaint but also excelled as a sixth man. He won the Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2010, 2014, and 2016.</p> <p>Billups, known as \"Mr. Big Shot,\" is highly respected for his tenacious defense and clutch performances. The highlight of his career was in 2004 when he averaged 21 points and 5.2 assists in the NBA Finals, helping the Detroit Pistons win the championship that year. He also earned the Finals MVP award. Billups won the NBA Sportsmanship Award in 2009 and the NBA Teammate of the Year Award in 2013. He has been selected as an All-Star five times, made the All-NBA Team three times, and is currently the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.</p> <p>Noah, known for his passionate play, had an outstanding college career, winning consecutive NCAA championships in 2006 and 2007. After entering the NBA, he won several defensive awards and was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2014. He has been selected as an All-Star twice, made the All-NBA Team once, and has been named to the All-Defensive Team three times. Unfortunately, injuries plagued him in the later years of his career, and he only played in 672 games, which is fewer than the other inductees.</p> <p>Stoudemire, also known as \"STAT,\" was one of the few high school players to jump straight to the NBA. In his rookie season, he averaged 13.5 points and 8.8 rebounds per game, outshining the number one pick Yao Ming and winning the 2003 NBA Rookie of the Year award. He has been selected as an All-Star six times and made the All-NBA Team five times. Throughout his career, Stoudemire averaged 18.9 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game.</p> <p>Marion, known as the \"Matrix,\" was a versatile player who could guard positions one to five.

Despite not making the playoffs last season, and even missing out on the play-in tournament, most fans should be very pleased with the team's performance considering our initial expectations. Executive Danny Ainge let go of the obsession with the playoffs before the trade deadline, trading some veteran players for future assets, which is the operational model that fans hoped for after Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert left.</p> <p>Big man Walker Kessler has the opportunity to take his game to the next level after an impressive rookie season, where he had a shooting percentage of 72% and blocked 173 shots, ranking fourth in the league.</p> <p>Furthermore, Lauri Markkanen, who was selected for the All-Star team and won the NBA Most Improved Player award, will also be returning. He had a career year last season, averaging 25.6 points and 8.6 rebounds per game with a near 50% shooting percentage. In addition, the trade for 25-year-old John Collins represents a low-risk, high-reward investment that adds more depth to the Jazz's core lineup. </p> <p>Early last season was a pleasant surprise, as most people did not anticipate Markkanen's significant improvement. Without Mitchell, it was expected that the team would lack a scoring leader and the ability to go toe-to-toe with opponents in crucial moments. Surprisingly, Markkanen not only excelled in three-point shooting (39.1%), but also showed good ball handling skills, forcing defenders to limit his driving routes and counterattacks.</p> <p>As for other players, veteran Jordan Clarkson has started to develop his own organizational skills, and Talen Horton-Tucker occasionally has scoring outbursts. This team seems to have a certain level of competitiveness in the future.</p> <p>However, the biggest concern is whether the Jazz can compete for a playoff spot in the highly competitive Western Conference. Despite their defensive potential and Kessler getting more playing time in his second season, it's hard to imagine the team having an above-average record. Last season, they ranked eighth in defense in the league, allowing opponents to score 116 points per 100 possessions and ranking last in points allowed in the paint and points off turnovers.</p> <p>With center Kelly Olynyk potentially seeing reduced playing time to make room for Kessler, and Collins possibly entering the starting lineup, the Jazz may be slightly lacking in frontcourt playmaking.</p> <p>Last season, the combination of Markkanen, Collins, and Kessler averaged only four assists per game. However, Collins' addition is still hard to oppose, even with his large contract amount. The Jazz acquired him affordably during a low point, and last season his three-point shooting percentage was the worst of his career at 29.2%. However, it's undeniable that Collins had finger health issues. If the finger problems decrease, there is reason to believe that Collins' three-point shooting can approach his career average of 35% or even better, providing considerable value to the Jazz's contract.</p> <p>Regardless, the rebuilding Jazz team should still be intriguing.

With about a month left until the Hangzhou Asian Games, they will move to Australia for a two-week training camp and play six friendly matches against local professional teams.</p> <p>He mentioned that Chen Yingjun, the main guard, will still not be able to join the team on this trip to Australia, but his injury is recovering well, and it is expected that he will return before the Asian Games. \"We don't need to worry about Yingjun's personality. He has already started training again, so he will definitely be brought to the Asian Games.

He mentioned that throughout the Jones Cup, from the first game to the last day, it was evident that the players made breakthroughs, and he believes that these players have the opportunity to represent the Chinese team on the international stage. The He brothers, He Dan and He Bo, were the most popular figures of this Jones Cup. They thanked the Chinese Basketball Association for the invitation, coach Xu Haocheng for his guidance, and all the senior players from the Chinese Blue and White teams for their selflessness and willingness to share their experiences. They also thanked the passionate fans who joined them on this amazing journey in Taiwan this summer and expressed their hope to continue fighting together on the court and meet again next year.

The Chinese White Team's last win was on the previous Sunday's game, so their goal for today was definitely to end the tournament with a victory and leave a good impression. The Chinese White Team continued their good momentum from yesterday's game against the South Korean Team, performing better both offensively and defensively than in their previous losses. They took a 12-6 lead, with Ma Jianhao, Chen Fanbayi, and Hong Kaijie making shots from the perimeter. The first quarter ended with the Chinese White Team leading 25-15.</p> <p>In the second quarter, the White Team maintained their lead with two fast break points and a three-pointer from Hong Kaijie. The Iranian Team's offense awakened in this quarter, repeatedly scoring from outside the three-point line. The White Team called two timeouts to address this issue and temporarily held an 8-point lead at halftime. In the second half, the Ho brothers continued to contribute to the White Team's scoring record, but the Iranian Team still put significant pressure on them, demonstrating patience in handling every possession. With a little over 3 minutes left, Ma Jianhao's fast break dunk ignited the emotions of the home fans, but unfortunately, it didn't reduce the Iranian Team's scoring in this quarter.

Shortly after, Ma Jianhao made another three-pointer, extending the White Team's lead to 6 points with 2 minutes remaining.</p> <p>At a critical moment, with 1 minute and 29 seconds left, Ma Jianhao scored a turnaround fadeaway shot. Bai Yaocheng made a left-side cut to score, evading the defender, but when the White Team had an 8-point lead, they allowed the Iranian Team to score three-pointers and make fouls on drives, reducing the deficit to 2 points. Then, a turnover occurred during a backcourt inbound pass with 2 points remaining.</p> <p>Fortunately, after the Iranian timeout, the White Team successfully defended against the Iranian Team's offense. Chen Fanbayi calmly made two free throws after being fouled. The Iranian Team missed their shot again, and the game ended with a 91-86 victory for the White Team, finally breaking their five-game losing streak. In this tournament, the Chinese White Team achieved 3 wins and 5 losses.

Both teams are from the Baltic region.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this is a short-term tournament, so it is difficult to objectively compare whether it is Puerto Rico's back-to-back games that are too tiring, a clash of European playing styles, or Lithuania's superior performance. In any case, Latvia, which won by a slim margin against Puerto Rico in the previous game (13 points for Lithuania vs 12 points for Latvia), suffered a heavy defeat, trailing by 35 points at halftime and losing by 24 points in the end. * Analyzing the performance of the teams and the quality of the players, it is evident that Latvia is not on the same level as Lithuania. However, in the author's opinion, the difference between the two teams is not as significant as it appears on paper. The cumulative effects of several key factors led to Latvia's major loss in this game. Please continue reading.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The difference in bench strength: From the start of the game, it was apparent that Lithuania was more focused and intense compared to their game against Puerto Rico. They aggressively utilized their two main players, Valanciunas and Jokubaitis, in a 2-Men Game pick-and-roll offense, displaying greater aggression and efficiency than in the previous game. Despite this, Latvia, led by the 7'2\" center Pasecniks, managed to keep up with Lithuania's aggressive offense, leading to a 12-12 tie. * In this game, Valanciunas played aggressively from the first quarter and even added pressure with strong attacks in the fourth quarter. He showcased his NBA-level skills, even using Harden-style drawing fouls, and celebrated his success with a smile. However, once both teams made substitutions, the difference became apparent. Perhaps if they played again, Latvia would not substitute their starting lineup so thoroughly. Without an effective pick-and-roll offense in the paint, Latvia resorted to testing their luck from the outside against Lithuania's solid defense. On the other hand, Lithuania still had NBA-level backup center Motiejunas and Canadian naturalized player number 9, Brazdeikis, who played with an American playing style. They continued the ball-handling offense initiated by Jokubaitis, resulting in a widening gap. This ultimately led to a devastating 18-0 run by Lithuania in the second half of the first quarter, turning the score from 12-12 to 12-30, effectively sealing the game.</p> </li> <li> <p>Defense, defense, defense! Although many fans praise Lithuania's smooth team tactics, selflessness, and emphasis on spacing on the offensive end, their advantage compared to Latvia is limited. Their main strength lies in the individual skills of their players. When Latvia increased their defensive intensity in the second half, applying more aggressive pressure, Lithuania's smooth offensive flow was disrupted, and they had to rely on individual abilities.</p> </li> </ol> <p>What truly impressed spectators at the venue was the defense, possibly the highest intensity ever witnessed in a basketball game in Taiwan (whether it be an NBA team or Barcelona in the Spanish League).</p> <p>From man-to-man defense at the start of the game to suffocating zone defense later on, Lithuania's defensive rotations, help defense, whether it be screens or defensive positioning, were incredibly swift. The team's aggressiveness and cohesion were commendable, even inspiring the author. Please continue reading.</p> <p>In this game, Lithuania demonstrated remarkable selflessness and unity. Even their two main centers, Valanciunas and Motiejunas, were seen frequently switching or chasing their opponents beyond the three-point line. Without everyone's relentless effort, regardless of their position or status, such tight team defense would not have been possible.</p> <p>It was precisely because of Lithuania's strong defense that they were able to easily extend their lead through defensive counterattacks from the second half of the first quarter to the second quarter. By the time Latvia also increased their defensive intensity in the second half, the point difference was already insurmountable. It was even more surprising that despite most of the second half being garbage time, Lithuania, once again, launched a full-court intense man-to-man defense in the supposed fatigued fourth quarter. Such physical and mental dedication is truly exceptional!</p> <ol> <li>Disparity in the ability to capitalize on opportunities: Lithuania's strong defense prevented Latvia from scoring opportunities unless it was through the presence of their tall players in the paint or occasional short passes to exploit gaps in the defense. Outside shooting opportunities were often fleeting, and when they did manage to find open space, their shooting accuracy was poor. Lithuania continued to focus on defense, not allowing easy shots from the outside. Latvia's three-point shooting percentage was only 21.4% (6/28). Even when they made cuts to the basket after receiving the ball, they often lacked execution power, resulting in frequent counterattacks.</li> </ol> <p>On the other hand, Lithuania, despite facing a slightly weaker defense from Latvia, had players who were just as effective at catching the ball after pick-and-rolls. Whether it was the accuracy of shooters positioned in the corners or the 45-degree angle (30% three-point shooting percentage throughout the game) or the individual ability to finish at the basket after receiving the ball (competitive one-on-one skills), Lithuania excelled.

For seasoned basketball fans, they may have witnessed the iconic moment when the USA Dream Team, consisting of players like Michael Jordan and Karl Malone, won the gold medal undefeated at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.</p> <p>However, more attention may be drawn to Lithuania, who won the bronze medal. Each player wore a colorful jersey with a skull dunking pattern during the awards ceremony.</p> <p>Read on, as this jersey is not just a piece of clothing, but a symbol of freedom and belief.</p> <p>Basketball in Lithuania is not just a sport, but a spiritual pursuit. Arnoldas Kulboka, who briefly played for the NBA's Charlotte Hornets, once said, \"Basketball in Lithuania is like a religion.\"</p> <p>And the numbers prove that Kulboka is not exaggerating. In 2015, the four highest-rated TV broadcasts in Lithuania were all games of the Lithuanian men's basketball team in the 2015 EuroBasket.</p> <p>During the 2018-19 season, \u017dalgiris Kaunas, a Lithuanian team, attracted an average of 14,737 spectators per game in the regular season of the European league, setting a historical record for European leagues.</p> <p>According to official statistics, Lithuania's total population in 2023 is less than 2.9 million, even fewer than New Taipei City, only slightly more than Taichung and Kaohsiung. However, this country in Eastern Europe, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, holds a significant position in the history of world basketball. As early as 2018, outstanding Lithuanian players like Lamelo Ball, Arvydas Sabonis and his son Domantas Sabonis, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas have successfully made their mark in the NBA. Frank Lubin is hailed as the father of Lithuanian basketball.</p> <p>Why does Lithuania, in a Europe where football is almost a national obsession, have such a deep love for basketball? The answer can be traced back to the 1930s when Frank Lubin, a Lithuanian-American known as Pranas, brought basketball culture to Lithuania. As a player and coach, Lubin led Lithuania to win consecutive championships in the 1937 and 1939 EuroBasket. Soon, basketball became the most popular sport in Lithuania.</p> <p>On June 14, 1940, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia were militarily occupied by the Soviet Union and later annexed as Soviet republics. Basketball became the greatest spiritual belief for the Lithuanian people who lost their sovereignty. The pride that Lithuanian basketball players could feel was to reclaim their dignity through basketball. \"During the Soviet era, basketball was the only way to show that you are Lithuanian, especially when you defeated CSKA Moscow,\" explained Arvydas Sabonis, who experienced both the Soviet and post-independence eras.</p> <p>CSKA Moscow, established in 1923, is one of the oldest basketball teams in Russia and won four European league championships during the Soviet era. They were one of the main teams where Soviet basketball national team players played. CSKA's biggest rival within the Soviet Union was \u017dalgiris Kaunas from Lithuania. \u017dalgiris Kaunas defeated CSKA in 1985, 1986, and 1987, winning the Soviet Super League championship consecutively. \"It was a peaceful battle through sports,\" said Alvydas Pazdrazdis, a member of the Lithuanian team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. \"To outsiders, it was just a game, but for us, it was more than just a game.\" \"The games between \u017dalgiris Kaunas and CSKA actually helped us establish national consciousness and contributed to the rise of national sports organizations like S\u0105j\u016bdis, eventually leading to our independence,\" added Arvydas Sabonis.</p> <p>However, basketball also brought frustration to Lithuanian players who were still under Soviet rule. Although players like \u0160ar\u016bnas Mar\u010diulionis successfully challenged the NBA in 1989 after much effort, most Lithuanian players had no say in which team's jersey they would wear. \"CSKA took me away like that,\" said Rimas Kurtinaitis, born in 1960, who played for CSKA from 1981 to 1983 before returning to his hometown team, \u017dalgiris Kaunas. He recalled, \"For me, playing for CSKA was better than serving in the regular army or being assigned to some forest in Siberia.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230826083206990057/","title":"NBA Irving talks about representing Australia in international games, but fails to fulfill his wish","text":"<p>Kyrie Irving    NBA Irving talks about representing Australia in international games, but fails to fulfill his wish</p> <p>Kyrie Irving.

He even mentioned during the livestream that when representing the United States, he considers himself an international player on the team. At the end of the livestream, Irving added that he chose to join the United States team because his college coach, Coach K (Mike Krzyzewski) from Duke University, recruited him when he was 17 or 18 years old. Irving also said, \"Coach K wouldn't let me join the Australian team.\" In 2012, there were rumors that Irving would join the Australian national team for the London Olympics, but he chose not to join.

Established in 2013, South Sudan only played its first official international game in 2017. Led by former NBA player Luol Deng, the team has recruited players with South Sudanese heritage from around the world. The team's players are mainly descendants of the Dinka tribe, known for their long limbs and exceptional athleticism. While lacking experience and strength compared to European powerhouses, South Sudan has a chance to secure victories against lower-ranked teams and represent Africa in the Paris Olympics next year.</p> <p>Puerto Rico, one of the shortest teams in the World Cup, relies heavily on their guards to establish a fast-paced style of play. Tremont Waters, a former NBA player, is the team's main player. Despite his small stature, Waters consistently contributes to Puerto Rico's offense with his skills. The team also has a solid frontcourt to counter opponents known for their physique. George Conditt IV and Ismael Romero are the main interior players for Puerto Rico. However, the team faces a tough challenge in their group as their opponents have taller and stronger players. Puerto Rico needs to play to their strengths and avoid being dominated in the paint.</p> <p>China, as the host of the previous World Cup, failed to qualify for the Olympics, disappointing many Chinese fans. This year, China has a new coach, Aleksandar Djordjevic, and a naturalized player, Kyle Anderson. The team has a balanced roster, and the addition of Anderson brings versatility. However, the absence of injured player Guo Ailun may affect their backcourt depth. China's key player is Anderson, who can contribute in various aspects of the game. Other players like Zhang Zhenlin, Zhou Qi, and Cui Yongxi are expected to make significant contributions. With Djordjevic's coaching and Anderson's presence, China aims to represent Asia in the Paris Olympics.</p> <p>Serbia, ranked 6th in the world, is known for its deep pool of talented players. Although they are missing Nikola Jokic in this World Cup, they still have NBA players Bogdan Bogdanovic and Nikola Jovic. Serbia's style of play emphasizes ball movement and involves the frontcourt players in decision-making. Despite the absence of Jokic and Vasilije Micic, Serbia remains a strong contender in their group. Their main challenge may come from South Sudan, who play an unpredictable style of basketball.</p> <p>Note: The original article contains information about the authors and photo captions, which have been omitted in this translation.</p>"},{"location":"20230826083316677717/","title":"Memories of Mamba: A Tearful Recollection","text":"<p>Do you remember what you were doing on January 26, 2020?

It must be admitted that for the author, that day in Taiwan was just an ordinary day.</p> <p>It wasn't until the morning of January 27, when scrolling through Facebook, that I was inundated with messages of R.I.P. At first, I thought it was some cruel hoax, so I quickly went downstairs and turned on the TV to watch CNN news. That's when I realized it was all true: a helicopter had crashed near Los Angeles on the morning of January 26, and all the people on board had tragically perished. The list of casualties shockingly included Kobe Bryant. Strictly speaking, I cannot be considered a die-hard Kobe fan, but I have a complex web of emotions towards him... is it love? Perhaps! After all, I witnessed his career from his debut until retirement.</p> <p>Is it hatred? Perhaps! His confidence, his determination, and his audacity in repeatedly challenging Michael Jordan's legendary status made me feel impatient and annoyed. So when I learned of his departure, instead of feeling sadness, I felt as if a piece of my heart had been hollowed out, a sense of loss and melancholy. Today, August 23, is Kobe's birth anniversary, and tomorrow, August 24, is \"Kobe Day.\" I always feel obligated to write something to commemorate him, but Kobe's career story is as rich as an encyclopedia, and everyone knows it by heart. It is beyond my abilities to recount every detail. So, instead, I will reminisce about the connection between Kobe and myself... </p> <ol> <li>KB8: Please continue reading. When Kobe left Adidas after his contract expired in 2002, KB8 was also renamed Crazy8. (Image source: Adidas) When Kobe first entered the NBA, he was a signed athlete for Adidas, and it was Sonny Vaccaro who recommended Adidas to sign him.</li> </ol> <p>At that time, the basketball shoe market no longer belonged to Adidas, but to Nike, all thanks to Nike signing Michael Jordan in 1984! Sonny Vaccaro's strategy for Adidas at the time was to sign student players with the potential to become stars (such as Kobe in 1996 and T-Mac in 1997). And what I am about to mention next is the first signature shoe that Adidas released for Kobe: the Equipment KB8 (hereinafter referred to as KB8). Interestingly, Nike's signing with MJ was also facilitated by Sonny Vaccaro (for those who want to know this story, you can watch the movie \"AIR\").</p> <p>Please continue reading. In 1998, it was Kobe's second NBA season, and he, along with his three Lakers teammates, S. O'Neal, E. Jones, and N. Van Exel, were selected for the NBA All-Star Game.</p> <p>At that time, Kobe was still the sixth man for the Los Angeles Lakers, but with his popularity, he became a starter for the Western Conference All-Star team through fan voting! The spirited Kobe wore his KB8 sneakers and went head-to-head with MJ in the All-Star Game. Although the Eastern Conference All-Star team emerged victorious, and MJ scored the highest with 23 points, winning the MVP, the debutant Kobe also had an impressive 18 points! With similar builds and skills, and the confidence of a young calf unafraid of tigers, it seemed as if he was declaring, \"I will carry on the legacy of the league's iconic torch!\" The initial three colorways of KB8. The face pattern represents the symbol of Feet You Wear, indicating that the technology concept originated from human feet. (Image source: Adidas)</p> <p>My connection with KB8 began in junior high school. It was my first pair of celebrity-endorsed shoes (Black/White edition). The upper was made of suede, and the sole featured the well-received \"Feet You Wear\" technology. My personal evaluation of these shoes is that they were both stylish and comfortable. The black suede exuded a luxurious and upscale feeling, while the \"Feet You Wear\" technology made it feel like walking barefoot \u2013 truly comfortable! It's just a pity that my feet were still growing at the time, so I couldn't wear them for more than a year. Additionally, suede was difficult to maintain for a mischievous junior high school student! </p> <ol> <li>Magazine Covers: Since high school, I have had the habit of buying Chinese basketball magazines. The ones I regularly bought were HOOP and SLAM, and I would decide to buy XXL based on the cover or freebies. Kobe has been a hotshot in the league since his debut, naturally becoming the darling of magazine covers!

In an anonymous poll among NBA players at the end of the season, Reaves was chosen as one of the most overrated and underrated players.

His professional career has nothing noteworthy.</p> <p>It's fair to say that McCants is bitter because he couldn't achieve what Reaves has achieved. However, having opportunities is one thing, but making the most of them is another. Just look at the Linsanity phenomenon. Please continue reading to find out whether Reaves is overrated or underrated. Based on his performance in the latter part of the regular season and throughout the playoffs, I personally believe that Reaves is the real deal, at least a qualified starter. At just 25 years old, he still has room for improvement. If we say that his value in the regular season is limited, then his performance in the playoffs is enough, right? Although his performance in the play-in tournament was mediocre, he significantly improved in the playoffs.</p> <p>In his first career playoffs, Reaves started in all 16 games, played over 36 minutes per game, averaged 17 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 4.6 assists, with only 1.6 turnovers per game. Although his performance dropped in the second round, he bounced back strongly in the Western Conference Finals, averaging over 20 points per game with an impressive shooting percentage. He became the third option for the Lakers after LeBron James and Anthony Davis.</p> <p>After the season, Reaves was selected to represent the national team in the Basketball World Cup, continuing to impress. Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, the Lakers' second-round opponent, said, 'Based on Reaves' performance in the Western Conference playoffs, it was an easy decision to choose him.' International games value physique, shooting, and decision-making on the court. They want primary ball handlers who can also shoot, cut, pass, and defend multiple positions without being exploited.</p> <p>Reaves possesses all these abilities, and his understanding and impact on the game are very high, making his selection for the national team no coincidence.</p> <p>Former Lakers teammate and current Philadelphia 76ers guard Patrick Beverley praised Reaves on his personal podcast. He said that Reaves' intelligence is what makes him impressive. Due to his appearance, Reaves has been underestimated.</p> <p>Based on my experience playing with him, Reaves has a great understanding of the game, which allows him to frequently get to the free-throw line.</p> <p>In the NBA, there are two types of players who can get to the free-throw line in large numbers. One type is those with incredible athleticism and physique who can dunk over opponents, and the other type is those who are very smart.</p> <p>It's obvious that Reaves belongs to the second type. Reaves' abilities are well-known among basketball circles, but due to his restricted free agency status, he didn't attract much attention in the market. With only two years of experience, he had no salary cap space available with the Lakers and could only accept the early bird exception contract, signing a 4-year, $56 million deal with a player option for the fourth year and a 15% trade kicker. It is clearly below market value considering Reaves' skills. In comparison, Jordan Poole, who has a slightly stronger offensive firepower but weaker organization and defense, signed a 4-year, $128 million contract. Tyler Herro of the Miami Heat signed a 4-year, $120 million contract, offering even higher cost-effectiveness. In recent years, NBA salaries have rapidly increased, and a young quality starter's annual salary of $20 million is considered the baseline. Reaves' salary is lower than his output.</p> <p>Whether with his mother team, the Lakers, or in the upcoming World Cup, Reaves plays a similar role.</p> <p>Offensively, he mainly acts as a playmaker, occasionally initiating pick-and-rolls and defusing time bombs. He can switch between on-ball and off-ball roles, has low turnover tendencies, threatens from the perimeter, and defensively, Reaves is a coach's valuable chess piece. In warm-up games, it was not uncommon to see three guards on the court at the same time. When he first started, Reaves earned playing time through his defense. In his rookie year, he fearlessly guarded top-tier guards like Ja Morant and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, earning praise from fellow Lakers alum and defensive stalwart Alex Caruso. In the recent playoff journey, Reaves didn't neglect his defense, especially when he chased the Warriors' splash brothers. In the later stages of the series, it even affected his own shooting.</p> <p>In summary, Austin Reaves is a versatile player who is both underrated and overestimated. He has proven himself in the playoffs and international games, showcasing his abilities and basketball IQ. Despite his restricted free agency status, he has shown his value on the court. Whether for the Lakers or in the upcoming World Cup, Reaves will play a crucial role as a playmaker and a smart defender.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230827120255132381/","title":"The arrival of the San Antonio Spurs' first overall pick, Admiral David Robinson:","text":"<p>\"He saved the entire team   The arrival of the San Antonio Spurs' first overall pick, Admiral David Robinson:</p> <p>\"He saved the entire team. That's it.\" </p> <p>Please continue reading as former Spurs owner Red McCombs talked about how important David Robinson, also known as the \"Admiral,\" was to the San Antonio Spurs before the start of the 1999 NBA Finals.</p> <p>In 1987, the Spurs were in trouble. Their home attendance had been declining for eight consecutive seasons, with an average of only 8,009 fans attending games during the 1986-87 season. They had the smallest market in the NBA and ranked 42nd in the US television market. In terms of revenue, season ticket sales, and any other relevant indicators, the Spurs were at the bottom of the league. The main problem was the team's performance. Since the departure of their star player George Gervin in 1985, who was known as the \"Iceman,\" the Spurs had been in decline. They had never been able to break a winning percentage of .500. \"The team was dead,\" said McCombs. Please continue reading (the disappointing number of spectators on the sidelines) \"We were at a critical moment.\"</p> <p>That's what the team's general manager, Bob Bass, said at the time. \"We need to do something to bring the fans back to the arena.\" Please continue reading. If the Spurs hadn't been lucky enough to get the first overall pick in 1987, San Antonio might not have been able to keep its last professional sports team, McCombs recalled. NBA Commissioner David Stern told him in 1987 that the Spurs might not survive in San Antonio, and McCombs couldn't argue. However, the Spurs did get the first overall pick, and the basketball history of South Texas was rewritten.</p> <p>All the hope of the Alamo rested on a seven-foot Naval officer: David Robinson.</p> <p>Typical NBA top draft picks usually start to shine in seventh or eighth grade. They are taller, faster, and have better basketball skills than their peers. They dominate in high school, attend high-level basketball camps, and are pursued by coaches from top basketball colleges. They make a name for themselves in college basketball and become highly sought-after prospects, with everyone vying for them to become the top draft pick. However, Robinson, the consensus top pick in 1987, didn't follow this standard path. He only had one year of high school basketball experience, didn't attend any basketball camps, and when he entered college, he was only 6'6\" and 175 pounds. He attended the Naval Academy, and his dream was to become a naval officer; professional basketball was never on his list of aspirations.</p> <p>However, the height limit for admission to the Naval Academy was 6'6\", and Robinson grew seven inches after enrolling. Suddenly, he became the center of attention. His height increased, but his coordination and speed remained outstanding. On the court, he was faster and taller than anyone else. \"I didn't even notice how fast I was growing,\" said the 7'1\" Robinson. \"I just noticed more and more people looking at me and saying, 'Man, you have to play basketball!'\" About 5% of Naval Academy students continue to grow to 6'8\" after enrollment, but even with that height, it was still not enough to establish a foothold in Division I college basketball. Moreover, the Naval Academy was not primarily a basketball school, and no player had been selected to the All-American team since 1933.</p> <p>However, having a 7-foot giant at the Naval Academy allowed the team, under Robinson's leadership, to become a powerhouse in the NCAA. They not only made it back to the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16 for the first time since 1960 but also reached the Elite Eight, setting a new record for the team. Robinson also grew into a super beast, receiving many invitations from colleges to transfer and becoming the coveted future top draft pick for NBA teams. Getting a million-dollar contract in the professional league was not a problem. However, being at the Naval Academy raised questions about Robinson's basketball career. When asked if Robinson had any flaws, Washington Bullets (now the Wizards) general manager Bob Ferry bluntly said, \"Yes, his flaw is that he's in the Navy.\" Because Naval Academy graduates had to serve for five years, the discussion about whether Robinson should transfer to another basketball powerhouse to resolve his military service issue became the headline of newspapers and magazines at the time. However, Robinson's father was a loyal Navy man, which led Robinson to decide to stay at the Naval Academy, effectively cutting off his NBA path, causing a major controversy.</p> <p>However, the Naval Academy's high-ranking officials found a win-win solution. After all, having Robinson stay not only proved the loyalty of Naval Academy graduates but also made Robinson a ready-made advertising face for the military. However, being 7 feet tall still posed limitations for certain submarine missions, so the Navy willingly adjusted Robinson's service period to two years, creating a situation that pleased everyone.</p> <p>Robinson could remain loyal, and the NBA could gain a future generation of centers.</p> <p>For the struggling Spurs at the time, both in terms of on-court performance and off-court ticket sales, having the lottery pick to choose Robinson was a godsend.</p> <p>Robinson not only played the crucial position of center in the NBA but also excelled off the court. He scored 1320 on his SAT, majored in mathematics at the Naval Academy, and was skilled in music and computers. Apart from basketball, he had dabbled in gymnastics, bowling, golf, taekwondo, and tennis, and he was known for his humility and openness.</p>"},{"location":"20230827120330102455/","title":"\"Lost in the East, Collected in the Sunset: Jaden Ivey Emerges as a Strong Ball Handler\"","text":"<p>The mountains stand tall, layered and majestic    \"Lost in the East, Collected in the Sunset: Jaden Ivey Emerges as a Strong Ball Handler\"</p> <p>The mountains stand tall, layered and majestic.</p> <p>The main discussion revolves around interesting topics or players, occasionally commenting on current events. Among the speedy and athletic guards, the first recommendation is Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies, who has faced off-court scandals. Another player is Russell Westbrook, who won MVP but has moved around in his later career. The focus of this article is Jaden Ivey, who stands at 6-4 and possesses excellent athleticism. Prior to the draft, he was compared to explosive guards like Victor Oladipo and Donovan Mitchell, but the best version of him would be someone who can handle the ball like Morant. Please continue reading to find out more.</p> <p>Compared to Morant, Ivey bears a closer resemblance to former MVP Westbrook. In college, Morant was already a great ball handler, averaging over 10 assists per game in his sophomore year. Westbrook, on the other hand, had Darren Collison as the primary ball handler during his time at UCLA. Westbrook became a starter in his sophomore year, but his numbers were not impressive, with only 13 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. His unstable outside shooting was a significant flaw.</p> <p>However, with his extraordinary physical abilities, Westbrook was still regarded as a top ten pick in the draft. Sam Presti, the Thunder's general manager at the time, saw something different in Westbrook and selected him with the fourth overall pick in the 2008 draft, surprising many experts.</p> <p>In hindsight, it must be said that Presti had a keen eye, as Westbrook exceeded everyone's expectations. With Kevin Durant being selected second overall the previous year and James Harden being selected third overall the following year, the Thunder became the big winners of the draft for three consecutive years, building the strongest young core in the early 2010s.</p> <p>Returning to the main character of this article, Ivey did not have standout teammates in college, so he became the primary ball handler due to his athleticism and cutting abilities that surpassed others in a different dimension.</p> <p>However, generally speaking, his ball handling skills are not highly regarded. His ability to dribble with his non-dominant hand needs improvement, and once he cuts inside, he often only focuses on the basket. He has excellent dribbling skills, but lacks the ability to read defenses, making him, at best, a highly athletic work in progress.</p> <p>Please continue reading. In the summer of 2021, Ivey was selected by the U.S. U19 national team and made it to the finals, where they faced off against the newly drafted French monster, Victor Wembanyama.</p> <p>In the championship game, Ivey scored the highest 16 points for the team, helping the U.S. defeat France by just two points. Throughout the tournament, he averaged 12 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. Ivey, together with Thunder center Chet Holmgren, was also selected as one of the five best players in the U19 World Cup. After entering the NBA, Ivey was selected fifth overall by the Pistons. At that time, it was widely believed that his excellent athleticism would complement the weaknesses of the 2021 top pick, Cade Cunningham, in terms of explosiveness.</p> <p>The Pistons had already designated Cunningham as their main ball handler, so Ivey could focus on developing his off-ball skills and outside shooting without bearing heavy ball handling responsibilities initially.</p> <p>However, for the Pistons, tragedy struck soon after the season started. Cunningham suffered a shin injury, and after resting for a month without improvement, he decided to undergo surgery and miss the entire season.</p> <p>With the Pistons already having one of the worst records in the league, losing their backcourt commander meant that the season was no longer in suspense, and they ultimately finished with the worst record in the league. Please continue reading. Cunningham's injury provided more opportunities for other players, and the biggest beneficiary was French third-year guard Killian Hayes.</p> <p>He once again earned a starting opportunity, which meant more than being compared to veteran Cory Joseph. This time, he did not let the opportunity slip away and showcased his talents.</p> <p>Finally completing a healthy season, Hayes averaged 10 points, 6 assists, and 3 rebounds, displaying excellent defense and a good passing vision, which should earn him a new contract.</p> <p>For Ivey, this situation was both fortunate and unfortunate. He became the only Pistons player with penetrating abilities and took on the majority of the ball handling responsibilities.</p> <p>The fortunate aspect is simple - apart from a few exceptional rookies, there are not many newcomers who can handle the ball extensively. Some things need to be faced head-on to understand, such as the level of competition, height, and speed in the NBA. The unfortunate part is that after taking on the ball handling responsibilities, Ivey was unable to strengthen and improve his weaknesses, especially in reading defenses and making correct decisions. In college, Ivey had several offensive weaknesses, including using his non-dominant hand (left hand) for penetration, lacking mid-range scoring ability, having a subpar three-point shooting percentage, and most importantly, lacking the ability to read defenses and make correct decisions. Fortunately, Ivey is naturally talented, and throughout the season, he significantly improved his decision-making abilities. His weaknesses in mid-range scoring also started to become threatening, hinting at the potential of a qualified ball handler.</p>"},{"location":"20230827120358853380/","title":"Olympic Qualifiers Nurkic and Musa Complain Again About the Inability of the Bosnian Basketball Federation to Provide Basic Needs","text":"<p>According to Bosnian players Jusuf Nurkic and Dzanan Musa, the Bosnian Basketball Federation has repeatedly failed to meet the basic needs of the players due to financial constraints. This has severely impacted their treatment, as they have been unable to afford warm-up matches and have had to form temporary teams without a conditioning coach. In addition, they have had to share beds and sleep in cramped conditions to save expenses. These issues came to light during last year's EuroBasket, when Nurkic posted a time-limited story on Instagram showing the players flying in economy class to Germany, sparking a lot of discussion. Many media outlets subsequently interviewed Bosnian players, including Nurkic, who openly expressed their dissatisfaction with the poor conditions provided by the federation. They emphasized that playing for the national team is the easiest part, as they have to take care of many things themselves before the matches.</p> <p>Jusuf Nurkic. Photo / basketnews IG</p> <p>Currently, Bosnia is participating in the Olympic Qualifiers in the European region, and Nurkic, Musa, and others are representing their beloved country. However, they haven't forgotten to mention what the federation has prepared for them.</p> <p>Nurkic said, \"This issue has plagued our country for the past 30 years, and we are here to deliver a strong message. We cannot get the most basic needs, and there is no one we can turn to for help. Our performance consistently exceeds the environment provided by the association. We are still sleeping four people in one room.\"</p> <p>\"We are going to Poland for a game, but we don't have a conditioning coach. We want to ensure that future players who want to play for the national team have a proper environment. We feel like a circus here, and more players will eventually choose to play for other national teams,\" added Nurkic.</p> <p>Musa, who was selected by the Brooklyn Nets and currently plays for Real Madrid, also expressed his thoughts. He stated that he doesn't know what else to say and that playing for the national team during the off-season is purely driven by his passion, not for money or fame. Regarding the situation of four players sleeping in the same room, Musa said, \"Nurkic has made this issue known to everyone. The team must resolve it quickly. We cannot let this continue. When four basketball players sleep together, our feet keep touching each other.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230827120436764144/","title":"Bronny James and Shareef O'Neal, both living under the shadow of their famous fathers, also face heart problems","text":"<p>Bronny James and Shareef O'Neal, both living under the shadow of their famous fathers, also face heart problems.</p> <p>Article: Yesterday, Bronny James, the eldest son of LeBron James, collapsed during basketball practice and experienced a momentary cardiac arrest. Fortunately, after receiving immediate medical attention, he is now out of the intensive care unit and is expected to be fine. However, this collapse could potentially undermine all the efforts he has put in so far. As the son of LeBron, Bronny has had to face more attention and pressure than the average \"baller generation\" player. After all, he is not just the son of a player, but the son of a legendary figure with a historic position in the entire NBA. This naturally amplifies the scrutiny of his basketball talent.</p> <p>However, compared to his father's high school years, Bronny's dominance is not as remarkable. Although he still possesses good innate qualities, he has not displayed the same level of dominance that his father did in high school. He was even considered a \"tiger father's son\" at one point. Despite facing unfriendly criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continued to improve his skills. In his senior season, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, earning him a spot on the McDonald's All-American high school team. He was also given the title of a five-star high school player by some basketball media outlets and received basketball scholarships from some NCAA Division I schools.</p> <p>These achievements have significantly boosted Bronny's draft projection, going from a possible undrafted player to having the chance to compete for a first-round or even lottery pick.</p> <p>Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father LeBron's fame. LeBron himself has stated that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, there is a high chance he will join his son's team and play alongside him. This \"selecting a son for the father\" move undoubtedly has had an impact on Bronny's market value. However, we must not overlook Bronny's own efforts. He ultimately chose to attend the University of Southern California and plans to enter the draft after completing his freshman season. Before starting his college career, he posted on his social media, expressing his determination to prove the doubters wrong.</p> <p>However, the heart problem that has arisen before the start of his college season casts a shadow over his future. Similar to Bronny's case, this situation reminds me of another \"baller generation\" player, Shareef O'Neal, the son of basketball star Shaquille O'Neal. Shareef had achieved some success in high school, being regarded as a four-star high school player. He also intended to enter the NBA after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, he was diagnosed with a heart abnormality that posed a high risk to his life and required emergency surgery.</p> <p>The post-surgery rest and rehabilitation forced Shareef to stay away from high-intensity competition for a whole 11 months. This setback was detrimental to a rising player like him. Losing a year during the golden development period could significantly impact his skill level and competitiveness. Furthermore, considering Shareef's condition, which is less dominant even in the more intense NCAA, college coaches were hesitant to give him too much time. As a result, his college performance plummeted, and he ultimately faced the possibility of going undrafted. \"I have always told Shareef that he will never be the next me,\" Shaquille said. \"I want him to play his own game, his own style. Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the name O'Neal, but he still needs to create his own path.\" Shareef is currently waiting for an opportunity in the developmental league. Despite only averaging 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the previous season, overcoming the shadow of his heart condition is a significant progress. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be shackled by his father's achievements and reputation and to bravely pursue his own chosen path.</p> <p>I believe LeBron sees Bronny in the same way. Regardless of whether it affects his draft position or not, it will not diminish LeBron's love for his child. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by injuries and can showcase his value in the upcoming season.</p> <p>This article is published with permission from the author.

The last time Chinese White Team won a game was last Sunday, so their goal today was to end the tournament with a win and leave a good impression. Chinese White Team started the game with the same momentum they had against the South Korean team yesterday, performing better both offensively and defensively than in previous games. They took a 12-6 lead, with Ma Jianhao, Chen Fanbayan, and Hong Kaijie making shots from the outside. The first quarter ended with Chinese White Team leading 25-15. In the second quarter, the White Team continued to maintain their lead with two fast break layups and a three-pointer from Hong Kaijie. Iran's offense woke up in this quarter, with multiple shots from beyond the arc. As a result, the White Team called two timeouts and temporarily led by 8 points at halftime.</p> <p>In the second half, the He brothers continued to contribute points for the White Team, but Iran still put significant pressure on them. Iran showed great patience in handling each possession.</p> <p>With just over 3 minutes left, Ma Jianhao made a fast break dunk, igniting the emotions of the fans in the arena. However, Iran managed to close the gap in this quarter, entering the final quarter with a 3-point difference.</p> <p>At the start of the final quarter, He Dan immediately hit two consecutive three-pointers, and He Bo's fast break dunk broke the stalemate. Shortly after, Ma Jianhao made another three-pointer, extending the White Team's lead to 6 points with 2 minutes remaining.</p> <p>In a crucial moment with 1 minute and 29 seconds left, Ma Jianhao made a fadeaway jumper, and Bai Yecheng cut in from the left side to score, eluding the defender. However, when the difference was 8 points, Iran scored three consecutive three-pointers and drew fouls on drives to narrow the gap to 2 points. Then, a turnover occurred during a backcourt inbound pass. Fortunately, after Iran's timeout, the White Team successfully defended against Iran's offense. Chen Fanbayan calmly made both free throws after being fouled, and Iran once again failed to make a shot. The game ended with a 91-86 victory for the White Team over Iran, finally breaking their five-game losing streak. In this tournament, Chinese White Team achieved 3 wins and 5 losses. He Bo scored the highest with 18 points, while He Dan and Ma Jianhao both scored 14 points, Chen Fanbayan scored 13 points, and Ban Ba contributed 10 points.</p>"},{"location":"20230827120529707436/","title":"Review of Derrick White, the Unsung Hero of the Boston Celtics in the 2022-23 season","text":"<p>Data Comparison: GP: 75 \u00bb 82   MIN: 29    Review of Derrick White, the Unsung Hero of the Boston Celtics in the 2022-23 season</p> <p>Data Comparison: GP: 75 \u00bb 82   MIN: 29.3 \u00bb 28.3 Continue reading PTS: 13.2 \u00bb 12.4 FG%: 42.1 (4.5/10.7) \u00bb 46.2 (4.3/9.2) 3P%: 31.2 (1.5/4.9) \u00bb 38.1 (1.8/4.8) Continue reading FT%: 86.4 (2.7/3.1) \u00bb 87.5 (2.0/2.3) REB: 3.5 (3.0/0.5) \u00bb 3.6 (3.0/0.6) AST: 4.9 \u00bb 3.9 TOV: 1.6 \u00bb 1.2 Continue reading STL: 0.9 \u00bb 0.7 BLK: 0.8 \u00bb 0.9</p> <p>Since joining the team in a mid-season trade last year, White has seamlessly integrated into the Celtics. Despite the emphasis on team basketball in the Spurs, he has proven to be the best supporting role alongside the duo of J's. After further assimilation into the system during the offseason, he became the team's third most important player in the current season. He played the entire season without missing a game, earning a spot on the All-Defensive Second Team and even being selected as the Player of the Week. His performance has exceeded the expectations of all fans.</p> <p>With Smart's departure, White unquestionably became the starting point guard. His off-ball movement and receiving skills are excellent, especially his improved shooting from the perimeter, with a nearly 7% increase in three-point shooting percentage. This is the much-needed weapon alongside the duo of J's, allowing for better cohesion in the team's overall strategy.</p> <ul> <li>[Offensive Analysis] Since joining the team last year, White has briefly showcased his ball-handling abilities. When he demonstrates aggression with the ball, the team's offense always manages to break through. However, the offensive system last year was not as complete, and during the playoffs, he had very few opportunities to handle the ball. He was often left waiting as a spot-up shooter when the ball was given to the duo of J's, and he didn't always receive opportunities for cuts. Therefore, he couldn't fully unleash his offensive threat. As expected at the start of this season, after more time to gel with the team, White has transformed. Although his shot attempts have slightly decreased with Brogdon's arrival, his spot-up three-point shooting percentage has risen to 37.8%, greatly enhancing his value in half-court offense. He has near 40% shooting from both the top of the arc and the corners, overcoming the lack of confidence he showed in shooting last year.</li> </ul> <p>In addition to improving his three-point accuracy, White has reduced pull-up jump shots and increased his attempts at drives and floaters. Especially when he has the ball, he no longer hesitates as much, and with his physique, he can easily penetrate past many guards. It is common to see him taking floaters near the free-throw line after driving from the middle, and when the duo of J's attracts the defense on the sides, White's aggressiveness is sure to yield great results. Furthermore, he has done well in leading the second unit. When Williams III was absent at the start of the season, White was able to lead players like Kornet, Hauser, and Griffin to achieve good results. He has been a key factor in the team's success in the first half of the season.</p> <p>The most impressive aspect is White's performance in February. When Brown suffered a facial fracture from a hit by Tatum and Smart's ankle injury was recurring, White's role naturally increased. His shot attempts multiplied, but his shooting efficiency increased as well. He averaged nearly 20 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game that month. He even won Player of the Week and scored a career-high 33 points, including eight three-pointers, against the Hornets. This performance showed that he is capable of replacing the team's main players.</p> <ul> <li>[Defensive Analysis] In addition to his offensive improvements, White has made a significant contribution to the team's backcourt defense this year. Alongside Smart, they form a formidable defensive duo. His greatest contribution, in my opinion, is his ability to defend at the point of attack. He can use his speed and leaping ability to chase and defend against all guards in the league. Even when facing taller scoring guards, his defensive discipline and accuracy do not put him at a disadvantage. In addition to one-on-one defense, whether it's defending pick-and-rolls or guarding shooters off-ball, you can see that White is the most proactive player in bypassing screens and recovering on defense. He anticipates and disrupts lobs to the roller, contests jump shots after defending screens, and steals the ball during low-post matchups with centers. He has taken over the role that Smart used to fulfill.</li> </ul> <p>Although White hasn't shown much in terms of directing the defense, which is a concern after Smart's departure, it will be a challenge for the new season. Instead of focusing on his command, it's more about establishing better communication and understanding among the players. Paying attention to his pick-and-roll defense with KP and his defensive chemistry with the perimeter defense of the duo of J's will be crucial to the team's overall defense.</p> <ul> <li>[Playoff Performance] In the first round of the playoffs, White excelled in locking down Young on defense. Utilizing his size advantage and defensive footwork, he was able to anticipate and defend against every drive and floater attempt by the opponent. He also frequently disrupted high lob passes, forcing Young to rely on mismatches and outside shooting for offense. He held his matchup to a shooting percentage of only 31.4%.</li> </ul> <p>Offensively, he performed on par with the Hawks' guards, providing a consistent scoring threat outside the duo of J's with his shooting percentages of around 50.</p> <p>(Note: The statistical data provided in this review may vary slightly due to the removal of editor names and photo captions.)</p>"},{"location":"20230827120655152268/","title":"Terance Mann used to feel indignant when someone said that LeBron was better than Kobe","text":"<p>Terance Mann used to feel indignant when someone said that LeBron was better than Kobe.</p> <p>Terance Mann, forward for the LA Clippers, recently appeared on the show \"Sessions\" to discuss the importance of Kobe Bryant in his life.

The Bahamas performed exceptionally well this year and achieved their goal of advancing.</p> <p>For this qualifying tournament, the Bahamas assembled two local-born players, Deandre Ayton from the Phoenix Suns and Buddy Hield from the Indiana Pacers, both of whom are stable NBA starters. Additionally, they applied to FIBA, the International Basketball Federation, to transfer Eric Gordon to the Bahamas so he could represent the country. Earlier today, they successfully advanced. The transfer process was quite complicated because Gordon previously represented the United States in the 2010 FIBA World Championship. To complete the transfer, the player must not only apply to FIBA but also have the willingness to play for the new country and coordinate with the player's original country to relinquish their future eligibility. After FIBA's approval, the player can transfer to a developing national team that benefits the basketball community the most. Eric Gordon's mother is from the Bahamas, which allows him to play for the country. During the interview, the president of the Bahamas Basketball Association expressed his focus on Golden State Warriors player Klay Thompson because Klay Thompson's father, Mychal Thompson, was also born in the Bahamas.</p> <p>However, it may be difficult for Klay Thompson to transfer nationalities this time. In addition to Thompson still being in his prime, there is a chance that Steve Kerr will be selected to coach the US national team for the Paris Olympics next year. The criteria for FIBA's approval of nationality transfers is not clearly defined, so it is uncertain how many players can transfer through this rule. If there is a real opportunity for Thompson to transfer before the 2024 Olympic qualifiers, the Bahamas may have to choose between Gordon and Thompson to represent the country.</p>"},{"location":"20230828091858333204/","title":"Kyle Anderson changes his jersey number to 1 in the World Cup, Zeng Fanbo not selected due to injury in the final roster","text":"<p>Kyle Anderson changes his jersey number to 1 in the World Cup, Zeng Fanbo not selected due to injury in the final roster.</p> <p>According to local Chinese media reports, naturalized Chinese player Kyle Anderson, also known as Li Kai'er, will change his jersey number from 32 to 1 for the upcoming World Cup.

The first article in this series discussed Lauri Markkanen and was completed last September. I am glad to see that his performance with the Utah Jazz this year has validated my belief in him.</p> <p>Now, let's talk about Wendell Carter Jr., who was traded to the Orlando Magic in the trade involving Nikola Vucevic. However, I would like to focus on a different aspect of this trade, rather than just evaluating its success or failure based on their current performance, along with Franz Wagner. I am more interested in discussing whether the Bulls had better options at the time. </p> <p>Before we delve into the discussion, let's remove all references to editors' names and photo descriptions. </p> <p>One issue that led to the trade dilemma is the development problem (1) Was it all his fault? Before discussing Wendell Carter Jr.'s trade, let's take a look at WCJ when he was traded and WCJ after joining the Orlando Magic. Can they be compared? When the Bulls traded WCJ, he was criticized by many Bulls fans for his on-court performance, believing that the 7th overall pick was wasted. However, I personally didn't share the same view. I believed that WCJ was indeed facing difficulties and obstacles, but it was due to factors such as the coaching staff and the team's roster, rather than solely his own capabilities. </p> <p>Before we continue, let's address a concept. A phenomenon is often caused by multiple factors with varying degrees of effects. When we mentioned earlier that WCJ couldn't overcome the coaching staff and roster's challenges, it doesn't mean that the player has no autonomy or responsibility to solve the problem. It's about determining the extent to which the player should be held accountable under reasonable circumstances. Bringing up this concept is because we need to discuss who should be responsible for WCJ's difficulties, and many people believe it is Jim Boylen. However, I have a slightly different view.</p> <p>(2) Friend, do you remember a character named Wang Yuyan in Jin Yong's novels, who had no martial arts skills but could significantly enhance the effectiveness of her side's combat through her understanding of martial arts and guidance? Sometimes, you can find players in the NBA who possess similar characteristics. Their unique skills, talents, and interpretation of the game allow them to enhance the collective performance of their teammates beyond their individual talents. They act as glue guys and catalysts, bringing together various aspects of the game and catalyzing better chemistry on the court. If you find such a rare player, wouldn't you consider maximizing their potential through roster configuration? Good examples include Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo, while examples with less success include Lonzo Ball and Otto Porter Jr. in the Chicago Bulls. Regarding Otto Porter Jr., aside from his recent contribution as an important bench player in the Golden State Warriors' 2021-22 championship season, does he possess the unique qualities I described earlier? When Porter Jr. was traded from the Washington Wizards to the Bulls during the 2018-19 season, he had the following stats:  - Points: 17.5  - Rebounds: 5.5  - Assists: 2.7  - Steals: 1.2  - Blocks: 0.6  - Shooting percentages: 48.3% / 48.8% / 90.6%  - Average of 2.6 three-pointers made per game. </p> <p>In qualitative terms, during that time, OPJ was a versatile forward who could defend from the wing to the rim, serve as a secondary defender, and act as a defensive leader. He had ball-handling skills, transition playmaking abilities, perimeter passing, and a complete offensive arsenal. He had a high shooting accuracy for both pull-up and catch-and-shoot situations.</p>"},{"location":"20230828092013667277/","title":"The Educational Significance of the 2023 Jones Cup is Greater than Basketball: Russell Turner's Coaching Philosophy","text":"<p>\"This is not my first time here,\" said Russell Turner slowly    The Educational Significance of the 2023 Jones Cup is Greater than Basketball: Russell Turner's Coaching Philosophy</p> <p>\"This is not my first time here,\" said Russell Turner slowly. After a three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Jones Cup is back this year, inviting the University of California Irvine (UCI) to represent the United States. Turner, who has been in charge of UCI since 2010, is once again setting foot on the island. The last time he came \"here,\" referring to 27 years ago in 1996, the Jones Cup also had a US team, with ACC stars from the NCAA participating. At that time, Turner was an assistant coach at Wake Forest University and accompanied the US team to Taiwan. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Having participated in the Jones Cup before, Turner has a deep understanding of the competition and schedule. Although it may not be a tournament with official rankings or scores, having teams from various Asian countries participating is still a special and meaningful challenge for NCAA teams. \"Playing 8 games in 9 days, just like 11 games in 12 days back then, is a very intense schedule that puts us to the test. In mid-August, many universities in the US have already started their new semester, but UCI is still on vacation due to scheduling arrangements. Therefore, it is a perfect opportunity for us to train before the new semester begins.\" About two months before the start of the Jones Cup, UCI announced on its official website that its basketball team would participate. According to NCAA regulations, each university is allowed to have an international program once every four years, and UCI chose the Jones Cup for their journey this time.</p> <p>\"A lot of people in the US only watch American basketball,\" Turner said. \"The US is undoubtedly the best country in basketball, but basketball is not limited to just one style. Different countries, talents, and strategies in basketball require NCAA players to learn in order to understand the various ways the game operates.\"</p> <p>Although UCI started the Jones Cup with three consecutive victories, scoring over 100 points and winning by a margin of more than 60 points each time, Turner believes that this does not mean they are a superpower far superior to other teams, or that the Jones Cup lacks challenges for UCI. \"Many of our players are seeing how Asian teams play for the first time. In reality, teams like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates improved as the tournament went on. The result of losing to us on the first day may not truly reflect their strength. We just had enough depth in our roster this time to change strategies based on the on-court situation. We performed well in the Jones Cup, even better than I expected, and that's why we won.\"</p> <p>UCI brought 17 players to the Jones Cup this time. Turner mentioned that they usually maintain a roster of 16 players for the university team. Bringing an extra player this time was due to the need for depth in the lineup for intensive back-to-back games and the requirement to adjust tactics against different countries. Among the six players over 205 cm, four of them are over 210 cm, which is taller than Turner's usual lineup plan of having at least two players on the court to maintain a \"twin towers\" formation. However, in games against the Chinese Taipei Blue and White teams, Turner changed to a lineup with one big and four small players when he believed that spacing and defensive coverage were more important. \"My forwards also performed well and lived up to my expectations of changing the lineup. That's where we excelled.\"</p> <p>Over twenty years ago, Turner was an assistant coach at Wake Forest University. He then moved to Stanford from 2000 to 2004 and joined the NBA's Golden State Warriors as an assistant coach in 2004. In 2010, he left the NBA to become the head coach at UCI. While being a head coach carries more prestige than an assistant coach, Turner believes that the educational significance that college basketball brings is more important than professional basketball. \"Compared to professional basketball, college coaches can have a greater impact on players. College players may not be mature, but college coaches don't necessarily have to immediately help players secure better contracts. Instead, they can help them grow from boys to better men through their presence on the court. Of course, I still need to help the team win in college. But if I can help players become better individuals and bring more positive influences to themselves and their environment, that would be an achievement as a college coach,\" said Turner.</p> <p>In Turner's philosophy, winning is certainly important in basketball. Whether it's his original \"twin towers\" formation or the tallest starting lineup in NCAA history, which stood at 7 feet 6 inches and 6 feet 8 inches in a game in 2015, Turner wants to convey to his players that there is more to basketball than just winning. \"When I first came to UCI, none of the players were taller than me (6 feet 7 inches). We played fast, like Asian teams. Now, I usually use two big players, and we can still win. What I want to say is that basketball is always related to physique and skills. Having a better physique and better skills can give you an advantage. However, the most beautiful thing on the basketball court is that you always have different ways to improve. As long as you focus on your own path to success, you can make great things happen.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230828092046613536/","title":"Unemployed Players in the NBA Free Agency","text":"<p>If you have been following the NBA, you would know that the popular time for free agent signings is usually in July    Unemployed Players in the NBA Free Agency</p> <p>If you have been following the NBA, you would know that the popular time for free agent signings is usually in July. However, it is already late August, almost September, and there are still a group of players who have not found a new team. Among them, there are quite a few quality players who can provide valuable contributions. Today, we will discuss the unemployed players in the free agency. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Christian Wood is currently the biggest name in the free agency market. Surprisingly, he has not been signed by any team yet. It is speculated that his asking price may be too high, resulting in a lack of interest from potential suitors. Wood is the type of player that playoff teams would want, as he averages 16 points and 7 rebounds per game. With a field goal percentage of 50% and a three-point shooting percentage of 37%, he is above average and even considered close to being a top player. However, most playoff teams have limited salary cap space and can only offer minimum contracts. It would be somewhat disrespectful to offer Wood a minimum contract considering his skill level. Unfortunately, the reality is that the teams interested in Wood can only offer him the minimum salary. I believe the reason why Wood is still unemployed is not because no one wants him, but rather the inability to agree on contract terms.</p> <p>The Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers have been rumored as potential destinations for Wood. Personally, I think both teams would be a good fit for him, but it ultimately depends on whether he is willing to accept a lower salary. I believe in his abilities, and if he is utilized correctly, he can perform at a high level and even reach All-Star caliber. To illustrate, Wood's efficiency as a roll man in pick-and-roll situations surpasses 93% of players in the league. This statistic is better than that of players like Sabonis or Adebayo.</p> <p>Although Wood may not excel in defense, his offensive prowess is top-notch. Having a scoring threat like him coming off the bench is highly valuable, as he can change the momentum of a game at any moment.</p> <p>Taking the Lakers as an example, imagine having D'Angelo Russell and Wood leading the second unit. Who in the league could defend against their pick-and-roll plays? Even when LeBron James and Anthony Davis are resting, this combination of an inside and outside threat could outperform many starting lineups. Wood's abilities are strong, and his strengths and weaknesses are apparent. He is a player who can make a significant impact. If I were part of his management team, I would advise him to quickly sign a one-year contract with the Lakers, showcase his skills under the spotlight, and then pursue a larger contract. Just like how Dewayne Dedmon successfully rejuvenated his career and went to Toronto happily, there's no need to linger here. Sign a one-year contract, perform well in a big city, and the money will follow.</p> <p>Please continue reading.</p> <p>Kelly Oubre Jr.'s situation is similar to Wood's. He is also currently unemployed because good teams are interested but are offering less money, while teams with money are not interested in signing Oubre.</p> <p>Although Oubre's offensive efficiency may not be as good as Wood's, he is still a capable scorer, especially as a bench player. Last season with the Charlotte Hornets, he averaged nearly 20 points per game due to having the freedom to score. However, his shooting percentages are not impressive, with only a 31% three-point shooting percentage and a 43% overall shooting percentage. It would be a stretch to consider him a quality starter based on these efficiency numbers.</p> <p>You might think, \"Isn't Oubre a 3-and-D wing? Why hasn't he found a team yet?\" Regarding the defensive aspect, his 6'7\" height and excellent athleticism make him a decent defender. However, when it comes to his three-point shooting, I can confidently say that Oubre's accuracy is not great. You might be surprised, but throughout his career, he has never surpassed a 38% three-point shooting percentage, with only one season reaching a 35% mark. If this level of accuracy qualifies as a 3-and-D player, then the standard for such a designation is quite lenient.</p> <p>Please continue reading.</p> <p>If I were to evaluate Oubre, I would say that his best role is as a scoring wing off the bench. He has the ability to score in large quantities. If the game's pace is fast and there are many transition opportunities, he can easily contribute 20 points. However, should he be a starter for an entire season? Perhaps only a team like the Hornets from last season, who were in rebuilding mode, would be able to do that. Currently, there are rumors of interest from the Cleveland Cavaliers, Dallas Mavericks, and Miami Heat. Out of these teams, Cleveland seems like the best fit for him as they have limited wing depth, with players like Strus, LeVert, and Okoro who do not possess the same physical attributes as Oubre. If he joins the Cavaliers, he would undoubtedly receive playing time, as they lack scoring options off the bench. However, it is interesting to note that the three teams rumored to be interested in Oubre, namely the Mavericks, Heat, and Cavaliers, are also the slowest-paced teams in the league. Do you remember what I said earlier? Oubre excels in fast-paced games. His two best seasons were in 2020 with the Phoenix Suns and this year with the Hornets, both coinciding with these teams ranking 9th in pace. Given this background, it remains uncertain whether Oubre can fit in with his new team. However, at the moment, he does not have many options. He should quickly find a team in need of a wing player, just like Wood. Forget about the salary for now and focus on getting playing time.</p>"},{"location":"20230828092118388505/","title":"Rough Growth: DeAndre Hunter's Development Position","text":"<p>By 2023, the Atlanta Hawks began to feel dissatisfied with their current situation   Rough Growth: DeAndre Hunter's Development Position</p> <p>By 2023, the Atlanta Hawks began to feel dissatisfied with their current situation. With a new coaching staff and a completely different strategy from the previous season, the Hawks decided to rebuild the forgotten years. Please continue reading to learn more.</p> <p>In the summer of this year, even before the start of the free agent market, the Hawks quickly cleared John Collins, showing their determination to reshape the team's brand. Collins' high salary and declining on-court efficiency were some of the reasons for this move. In the 2022-23 season, he struggled to play alongside Clint Capela and his on-court role was once again in question.</p> <p>On the other side of the Hawks' roster, De'Andre Hunter, who is about to turn 26 this December, has a career resume that falls short compared to Collins' peak performance of nearly \"20-10\" per game. Although Hunter is a more reliable shooter than Collins and can create offensive space for the team, his rebounding and offensive creativity are below average compared to other wing and forward players in the league.</p> <p>Most concerning is that Hunter's plus-minus value has been below -1.5 in the past two seasons from a per 100 possessions perspective.</p> <p>Photo source: Getty Images This brings us to the next question: How should De'Andre Hunter develop? Compared to when he was drafted, he now faces tougher competition. Bogdan Bogdanovic is an efficient shooter and can be a primary playmaker, Saddiq Bey showcased his skills after joining the team midway through last season, and sophomore AJ Griffin is ready to spread his wings again. What about Hunter?</p> <p>During the Hawks' rebuilding period, he quickly established himself on the team after being selected with the fourth overall pick in the 2019 draft. In the past four years, he has started 200 out of 206 regular season games, averaging 31.1 minutes per game.</p> <p>In summary, he has been the undisputed starting small forward on this team. However, if Hunter struggles at the beginning of the new season and other wing options on the bench show promise, he will face the first positional crisis of his career. Last summer, he signed a four-year, $90 million contract extension with the team, but his current performance has not lived up to that price tag.</p> <p>The Hawks need him to provide defensive impact on the wing and even at the point of attack, especially in specific matchups. However, advanced defensive statistics show that his impact is still limited, and his defense has even declined in recent years. According to Basketball-Reference's Stathead database, in the 2022-23 season, only six players in the league played at least 2,000 minutes but had a Box Plus/Minus (BPM) value below -3.0, and a defensive BPM below -1.0. Among these six players, only three are not rookies, and Hunter is one of them.</p> <p>This explains why there have been frequent trade rumors surrounding Hunter, with Pascal Siakam often being mentioned in those discussions, possibly due to salary matching.</p> <p>Photo source: Getty Images Brad Rowland of Uproxx recently stated on the \"Locked on Hawks\" podcast, \"There is one person that I'm very, very, very confident will be on the trade block, about 99% sure, and that's Hunter.\"</p> <p>We'll wait and see. In conclusion, from various angles, it is evident that the Hawks have a strong motivation to trade Hunter in order to get rid of his high-priced contract.</p> <p>However, with Collins gone, Hunter may have the opportunity to play a larger role at the power forward position, where his spot-up shooting skills can be more effectively utilized. For example, when Trae Young and Clint Capela execute a pick-and-roll, defenders will be hesitant to help too much due to Hunter's outside shooting threat. Some may question if Hunter can handle the defensive responsibilities against bigger forwards and how efficient he will be on the boards. These are the accompanying questions that will arise. However, in the short term, he should be a competent versatile power forward according to the standards of a non-traditional one.</p> <p>In summary, the Hawks are facing an awkward crossroad. Can they afford to let Hunter go in a lineup that lacks perimeter defense? And if they keep Hunter, can they handle the ensuing salary pressure?</p>"},{"location":"20230828092616518097/","title":"The contract dispute involving former T1 League basketball star Lin Bing-sheng has recently garnered attention","text":"<p>The contract dispute involving former T1 League basketball star Lin Bing-sheng has recently garnered attention. Lin's statement indicates that he has become a sought-after talent due to his skills and abilities. However, the signing of the contract with the Lion City Builders indicates Lin's initial intention. Nevertheless, Taiwan Bank later presented a more enticing contract, including the influence of Lin's network, leading to a love triangle.</p> <p>While Lin is known for being nice, the signing process itself is serious and formal. Lin's situation can be compared to a beautiful woman who, due to momentary confusion, hastily marries one man but later falls for another. Lin's actions are similar to many cases in society, such as homeowners selling their houses in hopes of receiving the best offer or job seekers hoping for the best conditions and treatment from a company. This is human nature.</p> <p>Regardless of how good Lin is, from a legal standpoint, it is akin to selling a house to two buyers simultaneously. In the market, this not only involves a matter of trust but also compensation issues. According to the contract, the party that did not ultimately secure the transaction can indeed seek legal compensation, as has been seen in similar cases in the real estate industry.</p> <p>This is the first clear case of contract duplication in Taiwanese professional basketball. It raises questions regarding whether it can be handled similarly to breaches of contract in real estate or if there have been similar cases of punitive measures for contract duplication in the technology industry, serving as a reference for relevant parties involved in player recruitment. It would certainly contribute to the professional development of the basketball league.</p> <p>Ultimately, competition and excitement are crucial in sports. Apart from the abilities of players and coaches, the professionalism of white-collar workers and administrators plays a significant role in ensuring the longevity of professional sports. This incident involving Lin reveals the immaturity of the player himself and the inappropriate actions of a specific team (Taiwan Bank), resulting in dissatisfaction between teams. In the end, each team will continue to act independently, and fans will enjoy the spectacle, but the two leagues will diverge, and the new season will begin, leaving the issue unresolved.</p> <p>Lin's case should be seen as an opportunity for reflection. Although professional basketball tends to lean toward market freedom and competition, relevant sports organizations or entities should still take this incident seriously and propose practical solutions. This is an essential aspect that fans are concerned about and eager to see addressed.</p> <p>However, the current reality of the two major basketball leagues' inability to integrate, coupled with the recent Me Too scandal involving the former PLG CEO, creates a chaotic situation. It is doubtful whether any \"adult\" can resolve the issue between Lin and Taiwan Bank.</p> <p>The Lion City Builders' magnanimous statement has left a positive impression. In this turmoil, the team is the immediate and greatest victim.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the Lion City Builders, including their official press conference, displayed restraint and a polite attitude. The team provided clear explanations and maintained a calm tone throughout the recruitment process and timeline. In terms of image and marketing, the Lion City Builders have indeed lived up to their reputation, displaying a regal and majestic demeanor. This deserves recognition. In contrast, this incident has caused significant damage to Lin's professional image in the short term and will continue to be a source of pressure in the long term. Recent comments on social media overwhelmingly point out the player's significant lack of credibility. While Lin's performance in the Jones Cup may temporarily shift the focus, the stain of this contract signing issue will linger in the minds of teams and fans. In the long run, Lin must continue to prove his worth and counterbalance the negative news.</p> <p>If he fails to maintain competitiveness, it could affect his basketball career and future development. The parties involved will carefully evaluate this aspect. While Lin may currently receive lucrative offers, credibility is a lifelong assessment. Regardless of the final outcome, the pressure will always be on Lin. The individuals from Taiwan Bank who were involved in the negotiations also bear significant responsibility. Beauty and skill are temporary, but a person's character will receive the greatest recognition and praise. In conclusion, let us continue to hope for a dedicated and united professional basketball league. For the development of Taiwanese basketball, we need a prompt integration across leagues.</p>"},{"location":"20230828092639420694/","title":"Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic made history as the first player in NBA history to record 250 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in just five games","text":"<p>Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic made history as the first player in NBA history to record 250 points, 50 rebounds, and 50 assists in just five games.

Although the other league also has problems to face, T1 has also generated many areas for consideration. In this article, the author will explore the current situation of the league from three aspects: \"not choosing any rookies,\" \"prioritizing immediate effectiveness,\" and \"the impact of foreign player system.\" The author will share some opinions with everyone. Please continue reading \u25bc</p> <p>Choosing not to play if there is no playing time, is it an excuse or a plan? The focus of this draft was almost exclusively on Taiwan Steel Eagles giving up the draft in the first round. GM Qian Wei Cheng and head coach Liu Meng Zhu mentioned in interviews that the team still has players to develop, so they did not want to make forced selections and were concerned about affecting the players' development. In addition, there are restrictions on rookie signing contracts, so they decided to give up this draft. From these words, it is clear that the thinking of selecting immediate effectiveness is more prominent. However, considering the current situation, there was not much opportunity for teams with lower draft positions, and with players like Gu Mao Wei Jia and Han Jie Yu to develop, the author can understand this choice. However, along with the fact that both leagues have fewer players joining the draft, it has sparked discussions about the system and the thinking of the teams.</p> <p>From the author's perspective, completely giving up the draft is not a good move. The most significant consideration is definitely \"funds.\" Rather than investing in uncertain rookies, it is better to save them and use them in the free market.</p> <p>Such thinking is common in professional sports, but it may not be a good phenomenon for Taiwan, which does not have other mature secondary league environments. It is not necessary to provide actual playing time to grow. If there is adaptability and understanding, practicing with the team can also lead to progress. Time for adjustment can also allow players to smoothly integrate into the team's system. This is the bonus that goes beyond the performance of professional sports and can ensure a continuous supply of talent for the national team. If the goal is only to find experienced players to join the team, with the aim of competing for championships, it is not wrong. However, it is not beneficial for the overall development of the environment. Unless the three leagues discuss and merge or establish a hierarchical system to integrate a more orderly system, the problem may not be so significant. But in the absence of such a situation, it is better for teams to take on the responsibility of nurturing rookies.</p> <p>Although we don't know the true intentions of Taiwan Steel, it is still possible to receive rookies in the case of not choosing. There is a channel because those who are not selected become free agents and can negotiate lower salaries or not be limited by contract years. They may even choose to train without receiving payment. Invisibly, the system becomes an endorsement that favors the labor side, which is what the author meant by \"plan.\" Please continue reading.</p> <p>Of course, as the author has mentioned many times, professional sports is an industry based on business. It is not wrong for teams to think and operate in this way. However, from the perspective of the overall environment, continuous development is not ideal. Currently, the players' level is not sufficient, and if no one is willing to nurture them, a gap will appear over time, and it may even interrupt the motivation of those players in the intermediate level who want to move up to a higher level.</p> <p>Therefore, whether the league can observe this phenomenon and discuss adjustments with the teams will lead to better development and benefits for the players. It can also bring more motivation for players to pursue their dreams, which is what we expect and want to see.\u25bc</p> <p>The demand for immediate effectiveness or the long-term operation mindset. In the draft of the two professional leagues this year, both exhibited a mindset that prioritized immediate effectiveness, and the idea of nurturing players or long-term development was diminished. From the author's perspective, although the number of players is gradually saturating, their abilities have not reached a level where they can significantly affect the team's performance and strength. There are still many imbalances in each team's capabilities.</p> <p>Short-term speculation in professional sports is not a problem since there is no salary cap yet. Teams can invest heavily and become evil empires, not caring about rookies and only focusing on star players or experienced players in the competition. However, this cannot bring benefits to the long-term development of the environment.</p> <p>Considering this, integrating or positioning the roles of each league is probably the problem to be faced in the future. In addition to the excitement of the games, the cultivation of talent pool will be another consideration. Just like professional baseball has the first and second teams or the social team system, and Japan's B LEAGUE has a grading system, perhaps \"farm teams\" will be the next point of consideration for Taiwanese basketball. The long-term operation of the SBL may be the best solution.</p> <p>If most teams believe that the UBA cannot cultivate immediate effectiveness, another feasible model the author has considered is to cooperate with the basketball association and require players participating in the professional draft to have at least one year of experience in the SBL. This way, they can start from the farm teams to gain experience and provide teams with more observation periods. It will also enable players to showcase their performance in a higher-intensity league, bringing more competition and screening effectiveness. Even if they are not favored by teams, players can choose to continue to hone their skills. Combining this with the recent mention by the basketball association about companies wanting to expand teams, it may be a viable solution. Lastly, instead of focusing solely on immediate effectiveness, the long-term cultivation system operation is actually more important. Players are not magic potions or shape-shifters. It cannot be assumed that they can adapt to any system in the shortest time. Different coaches' guidance will produce various team styles. There are teams like Special Forces and Sea Gods that emphasize the system, and there are teams like the Sun and Clouded Leopards that allow players to play their natural game. But regardless of which style it is, it takes time to adapt, especially for rookies who are experiencing professional sports for the first time.</p> <p>Instead of rushing to put them in the game and eliminating them if they don't perform well, it may be more mature for players to fully understand the team's system before stepping onto the court. It can also provide them with a longer opportunity for survival. However, that requires teams to invest in long-term cultivation, which is actually a thankless task.</p>"},{"location":"20230901161433745159/","title":"2023 World Cup Germany vs Finland Live Notes","text":"<p>Germany advances as the first-place team in their group with a dominant performance, while Finland finishes the group stage with no wins    2023 World Cup Germany vs Finland Live Notes</p> <p>Germany advances as the first-place team in their group with a dominant performance, while Finland finishes the group stage with no wins.</p> <p>In the previous game between Finland and Germany, despite Finland taking an early lead, Germany proved to be the only undefeated team in the group. After making adjustments and increasing the pressure in the second quarter, Germany pulled away, and Finland ended up losing all their games, finishing at the bottom of the group. After the game, surprise guest Nowitzki appeared near the interview area and exchanged handshakes with Schroder. Germany came prepared for this tournament, as they managed to come back and win against Australia, one of the top contenders for a medal. However, they faced some difficulties in the first quarter.</p> <p>In the first quarter, Finland had good three-point shooting and defended Schroder, causing him to struggle. They managed to take a lead of 22-19. Before the start of the game, an interesting scene was Markkanen sitting on the bench and practicing his shooting form. However, after that, things didn't go well for Finland. Germany started to play zone defense and put pressure on the ball handlers. Finland lacked the necessary skills and physicality to counter this defensive strategy. Their shooting accuracy dropped after multiple attempts, and their overall lineup was not as strong as Germany's. They lacked scoring options apart from sporadic firepower and struggled to create good scoring opportunities due to their guards' inability to pass the ball to advantageous positions.</p> <p>You may argue that Finland still had their star player Markkanen on the court. However, Germany made it a priority to target and limit him throughout the game. They assigned tough NBA forward Theis to guard him, making it uncomfortable for Markkanen to receive the ball. Even when Theis was off the court, Germany had MVP Bonga and Moritz Wagner to cover for him. The physical advantage of Germany's wing players in both offense and defense made it difficult for Markkanen. Finland's guards were also unable to pass the ball to Markkanen in positions where he could effectively initiate the offense, resulting in limited scoring opportunities for him. With the absence of three-point shooting threats and a lackluster overall lineup, Finland struggled to score.</p> <p>As long as Theis was on the court, the game was focused on limiting Markkanen. However, it is worth admiring that Theis also had an excellent performance on the offensive end. In simple terms, for Germany, containing Markkanen meant almost defeating Finland. Throughout the game, there were intense collisions and double teams against him. Bonga, who had NBA experience, was unstoppable in attacking the rim and became the game's MVP. As Finland's energy declined and their three-point shooting disappeared, Germany reduced Schroder's ball-handling time. The German team emphasized ball movement and tried to stretch and exhaust Finland's defense, taking advantage of their declining energy levels. As the defense was pulled apart and Schroder found his rhythm, Germany went on a scoring spree. Finland stopped struggling, and Markkanen was taken off the court early. The game ended in garbage time. Initially, Schroder's play was too individualistic and ineffective, but after adjusting the balance between scoring and passing, and as the opponent became fatigued, he found his rhythm, and the game ended in Germany's favor. Finland's group stage performances were similar, starting strong but fading towards the end. They had some success when their energy levels were high, but as their stamina decreased, their three-point shooting became inconsistent. Opponents could easily defend Markkanen by double-teaming him, and Finland had few effective offensive options. In simple terms, Finland still has a long way to go to reach the level of their star player within the national team. It is difficult for their playing style and roles to single-handedly turn the tide in international competitions. If Finland wants to become a stable force in European basketball, they still have a lot of work to do.</p> <p>What impressed me the most was that Finland is likely the team that had to travel the farthest to Okinawa for this tournament. However, they had the largest group of traveling supporters from their home country. I learned from chatting with them that each supporter had arranged around two weeks of time just to cheer for the national team. This passion for basketball in their home country is admirable. Let's see if Finland can develop a more long-term training system and if other players can bridge the gap with Markkanen. In this pre-tournament phase in Okinawa, many countries have organized travel groups to support their teams, and Finland's cheerleading squad is the largest. However, they still have to face the remaining two ranking matches, hoping to at least avoid going winless and increase their points difference (they are currently sixth in terms of points difference in the group stage). They have a higher chance of winning against Venezuela, but they are unfamiliar with Cape Verde, who gave Slovenia a tough time yesterday. If Cape Verde can maintain the performance that scared Slovenia, Finland might face another unexpected challenge. The good news is that this game will start today, and after a day of rest, Finland will face Cape Verde, who just had a hard-fought game against Slovenia. Let's see if Finland can perform well in the ranking matches and deliver some impressive performances for themselves and the fans who have traveled from afar. Finland did not have a game yesterday, and they went to the adjacent sports field for practice. Let's see if they can use their rest advantage to secure their first victory!</p>"},{"location":"20230901161522077384/","title":"Pre-season PLG S4 Familiar and Tasty: Can the Warriors' Trio Reunite and Make History Again?","text":"<p>The Taipei Fubon Warriors have always had the lowest turnover rate for foreign players in the league   Pre-season PLG S4 Familiar and Tasty: Can the Warriors' Trio Reunite and Make History Again?</p> <p>The Taipei Fubon Warriors have always had the lowest turnover rate for foreign players in the league.

However, the question remains whether their age will become a hindrance and if they can overcome the challenges from other teams.</p> <p>Please continue reading below \u25bc</p> <p>Zaytsev is known for his outstanding performance in the paint and his ability to work well with the team. Although he was affected by injuries in the first half of last season, he quickly became a key player after his return. With a high shooting percentage and strong rim protection, he, along with Cheng-Chun Tseng and Johnson, solidified the team's presence in the paint and overcame the previous decline in dominance.</p> <p>He played in all 9 games of the playoffs and championship series, with increasing playing time.

Warriors fans, we will see each other soon!\" Singletary, the veteran who joined the Warriors after the PLG started, formed a perfect combination with Zaytsev. Their strong lineup was unstoppable. With his robust physique and versatile offensive skills, Singletary could attack like a tank inside the paint and shoot from the perimeter like a sniper, even from a far distance. He was the ender of many critical moments.</p> <p>He averaged 23.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.6 steals per game last season, consistently ranking among the top players in various statistical categories. He was a key player for the Warriors to overcome the turbulence in the first half of the season. In addition, his experience can lead young players to grow and serve as a guide for new foreign players. His conversations with Johnson on the bench, especially during the championship series, ignited his fighting spirit and helped overcome challenges. His importance is undeniable.</p> <p>Singletary, who achieved many milestones last season, said, \"This is the only team I want to play for. This place has become my home, and I am excited to return to the Warriors in the new season. I can't wait to join the team and fight for the championship again!\" Johnson joined the Warriors only last year but quickly became an inside force. Known as the \"Highlight Generator,\" he ignited the enthusiasm of the Peace Memorial Library with his spectacular dunks. He never hesitated to entertain the fans with his skills. In the first half of the season, he single-handedly held the paint, averaging 21.5 points, 14.5 rebounds, 4 assists, 1.6 steals, and 2.2 blocks per game. His twin towers combination with Zaytsev dominated the championship series, and he was awarded the Finals MVP with his unstoppable firepower. The 38-year-old veteran once again won favor in the spring with his terrifying athleticism, soft touch, and basketball IQ. He often became the team's offensive initiator at the start of the game, and his ability to continuously score was unstoppable, just like flowing mercury.</p> <p>Johnson, entering his second year with the Warriors, said, \"Last season was an incredible experience. Returning means a lot to me, and I am grateful and will never forget it. I can't wait to welcome the new season with the team!\" </p> <p>With the retention of the trio of foreign players, the Warriors have successfully secured their strong backbone. They will once again fight alongside local talents to challenge for the highest honors in the PLG and EASL Eastern Conference. Their solid cohesion will be an essential weapon on the path to consecutive championships.</p> <p>Please continue reading below \u25bc</p> <p>The table above shows the performance of the Warriors' foreign player combination in the previous season. Apart from Perry Jones, who left the team early, any combination of foreign players demonstrated a certain level of dominance. The twin towers' lineup, in particular, had a win rate of 77.7%, giving Coach Chin-Che Chou more flexibility in adjusting to different opponent lineups.</p> <p>One common characteristic among the trio is their excellent team awareness. The Warriors typically prefer foreign players who understand the team's tactics and can execute them perfectly. They are unselfish on the court, always making the right decisions and sharing the ball. Their seamless teamwork is among the best in the league and is a key factor in the successful integration of local and foreign players.

There have also been similar terms such as \"Self-High Cup\" or \"Poor Loser Cup.\" However, even if the Jones Cup is considered a self-indulgent or self-high cup, so what? The William Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament, which was held after a three-year hiatus due to the pandemic, took place in Taipei Peace Basketball Gymnasium this year and officially concluded on August 20th. In the women's division, the Japanese team won the championship, while the Chinese teams finished in the third and fourth places. In the men's division, the United States won the championship, with the Chinese teams finishing in second and sixth places. The tournament's All-Star Five consisted of Liu Zheng, Lin Tingqian, Atino, Du'Vaughn Maxwell from the South Korean team, and Pierre Crockrell II from the American team.</p> <p>Before discussing this topic, it is important to understand the brief history of the William Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament. Renato William Jones, born in 1906, was one of the founders of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) in 1932 and served as its secretary-general for over 40 years. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the development of basketball, including making basketball an Olympic sport and promoting it worldwide.</p> <p>Since 1966, William Jones organized invitation tournaments around the world, including in countries like Spain and Argentina.</p> <p>In 1971, China officially joined the United Nations, and in 1974, the Chinese Basketball Association joined FIBA. As a result, Taiwan lost its membership. However, William Jones authorized the Chinese Basketball Association to organize international invitation tournaments in his name. Due to his significant influence in the world of basketball, the William Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament attracted countries from all over the world, including the United States, France, Denmark, South Korea, the Philippines, and Saudi Arabia. The first edition of the William Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament was held in 1977. Today, the tournament has reached its 42nd edition, with some interruptions due to the Chinese Taipei Gymnasium fire, SARS, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, the Jones Cup remains significant to Taiwanese basketball fans.</p> <p>In recent years, the Jones Cup has been referred to as the \"Self-Indulgence Cup\" or \"Self-High Cup,\" among other similar terms. The main reasons for such comments are twofold.</p> <p>First, there is a significant gap in the strength of participating teams. It is a fact that some teams in the Jones Cup have a much higher or lower level of competitiveness compared to international tournaments. For example, the South Korean team, which has traditionally sent their national team, had to send the championship team of the previous KBL season, Anyang KGC, due to scheduling conflicts this year. The Philippines also sent a professional team, the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters, from the PBA.</p> <p>Second, Taiwan often faces challenges in international competitions. The absence of Hamed E. Haddadi, who used to dominate in the Asian basketball scene, has weakened the Iranian team. The Japanese team consists of university players without the inclusion of players who participated in the World University Basketball Championship or the main players of the runner-up and champion teams of the WUBS. The United States is represented by the NCAA Division I team, UC Irvine.</p> <p>Given the above, it is understandable why there are comments about significant gaps in strength.</p> <p>However, even if the Jones Cup is considered a self-indulgent or self-high cup, so what? Looking back at the history of Taiwanese basketball, there was a dark period when Taiwan couldn't interact or compete with the outside world. Thanks to the efforts of previous generations, the authorization from William Jones and the birth of the Jones Cup became possible. Moreover, due to the continuous efforts of many people, including players, coaches, team administrators, organizers, staff, sponsors, and supporting fans, the Jones Cup has been able to continue for 42 editions. How many international invitation tournaments worldwide have reached such a milestone? In this process of 42 editions, everyone involved deserves recognition.</p> <p>Furthermore, how many opportunities does Taiwan have to host international tournaments, especially in basketball? Besides the Jones Cup, looking back at the data, there were only a few events such as the 2nd Asian Basketball Championship held at the Chinese Taipei Gymnasium in 1963, the 2002 Asian U18 Women's Basketball Championship, the inaugural 2004 Asia Challenge Cup, the 2017 World University Games, and the ongoing 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Warm-up Games organized by the T1 League at the Xinzuang Gymnasium. The chance to witness basketball talents from around the world in Taiwan is rare. So even if the Jones Cup is considered a self-indulgent or self-high cup, so what? Its existence allows Taiwan's basketball to connect with the world, exchange ideas with other countries, and evaluate the progress made throughout the year. It is a valuable opportunity. In the end, the players, coaches, and other members of the Chinese Taipei national team often feel the most neglected.</p> <p>As fans, we all have experiences in our lives where we have the opportunity to showcase our achievements, compete, or perform on a stage. When such hard-earned opportunities arise, don't we hope that our loved ones or fans can witness the glory? With the advantage of a home court filled with supportive fans, wouldn't there be more fighting spirit? The answer to these questions is undoubtedly yes. The members of the Chinese Taipei national team rarely have the opportunity to enjoy the advantage of a home court in most international competitions. The rare chance to experience the support of the entire crowd and have family and friends present to witness their best performances at the Jones Cup can be incredibly moving.</p> <p>The Jones Cup International Basketball Tournament has a long history. Regardless of whether Taiwanese basketball is going through a low period, the Jones Cup has persevered and become one of the most representative events in Taiwanese basketball, indirectly representing Taiwan's basketball culture. This tournament and culture cannot be solely protected by the organizers and participants. As fans, we should also come together and support it. We can consider the Jones Cup a self-indulgent or self-high cup, but so what? Excessive criticism and negativity will not help Taiwanese basketball progress. Most fans genuinely hope for the improvement of Taiwanese basketball. However, creating a supportive environment requires not only the willingness of corporations and organizations to provide support but also the support of fans. Be a rational fan. Believe that one day, Taiwanese basketball will be seen by more people worldwide.</p>"},{"location":"20230901161720246612/","title":"The Revolutionary Impact of the 2023 NBA Finals Vol","text":"<p>The Revolutionary Impact of the 2023 NBA Finals Vol.2: Three-Pointers Are No Longer a Guarantee of Victory, Nuggets' Championship Ignites the Renaissance of the League</p> <p>This year's NBA Finals have been full of surprises. The Nuggets and the Heat, who made it to the finals, were not favored to reach this stage before the playoffs began. The Heat started from the play-in tournament and after losing their first game to the Hawks, they fought their way through to become the second eighth-seeded team in history to reach the NBA Finals. Similarly, the Nuggets faced adversity and defeated the Timberwolves with their twin towers, eliminated the Suns with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker, and swept the Suns led by LeBron James and Anthony Davis. They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history and lifted the championship trophy. Please continue reading to learn about the Nuggets' 46-year journey and their historic wait, which is unmatched by any other team in NBA history.</p> <p>The Nuggets' key player in their championship run, Nikola Joki\u0107, is also an atypical MVP. He was selected by the Nuggets as the 41st pick in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft. Interestingly, when his name was called, there was a Taco Bell advertisement playing during the draft broadcast.</p> <p>Now, Joki\u0107 has become the first player in history to win both the regular season MVP and the NBA Finals MVP despite being drafted outside of the lottery.</p> <p>The matchups and the FMVP winners mentioned above highlight the uniqueness of this year's NBA Finals, and the Nuggets and Heat's unique experiences have brought many insights to the league's ecosystem.</p> <p>In this series, through four articles, we will analyze the revolutionary impact of the Nuggets and Heat series on the basketball world. The Revolutionary Impact of the 2023 NBA Finals Vol.1 - Nuggets' Championship Symbolizes the Decline of Small Ball and the Return of Big Men? Please continue reading the previous article to learn about how Joki\u0107 and the Nuggets changed people's perception of big men. This article will discuss the characteristics of this year's NBA Finals.</p> <p>The fast-paced small-ball trend is prevalent in today's league, but the Nuggets go against the grain in many aspects.</p> <p>This year's NBA Finals were filled with a retro vibe. The series had a pace of 91.70, making it not only the second slowest-paced series among all the playoff matchups this year but also the slowest-paced NBA Finals in the past decade. The last time an NBA Finals had such a slow pace was in the 2014 Spurs vs. Heat series (Pace 88.50). In the era of fast-paced basketball, the Nuggets and Heat's slow-paced battle stood out.</p> <p>However, both teams naturally play at a slower pace. The Heat emphasize physical and aggressive defense, while the Nuggets focus on half-court organization. In terms of offensive and defensive pace in the regular season, they ranked second to last and seventh in the league, respectively. Please continue reading to learn about the defensive slugfest between the Nuggets and Heat, which resulted in low-scoring games. The Heat have consistently been one of the top defensive teams in terms of defensive efficiency in the league.</p> <p>As for the Nuggets, despite having a size advantage with all five starters standing at 6 feet 4 inches (approximately 194 cm) or taller, their defensive performance in the regular season was less than ideal, ranking 15th in defensive efficiency. They were the worst-ranked championship team in the past 22 years (the 2000-01 Lakers ranked 22nd).</p> <p>Fortunately, the Nuggets regained their focus in time. In the five games of the finals, they allowed the Heat to score over 100 points in only one game. From Game 3 to Game 5, the Nuggets limited their opponents to 100.0 points per 100 possessions, showcasing their best defensive performance of the season, including the regular season and playoffs.</p> <p>Once again, it confirmed the iron rule that \"offense wins games, but defense wins championships.\" In the past few years' playoffs, traditional centers have often been targeted and exploited. Rudy Gobert, wearing the Jazz jersey, was the best defensive player in the regular season but became the primary target for opponents to attack in the playoffs. In last year's NBA Finals, the Warriors constantly set screens to create opportunities for Stephen Curry against Celtics' big men Al Horford and Robert Williams III. Although Nikola Joki\u0107's mobility is not particularly good, the coaching staff knows how to hide his weaknesses and highlight his strengths.</p> <p>The Nuggets' versatile forwards and guards have above-average defensive abilities, allowing Joki\u0107 to stay in the paint without needing to switch frequently to guard the perimeter. In addition, Joki\u0107's defensive instincts are excellent, enabling him to timely help defense and disrupt opponents' offense, performing well as a rim protector. Nice work from Jokic to get a deflection, Denver again turns defense into offense.pic.twitter.com/3VUCXsAm2s\u2014 Steve Jones Jr. (@stevejones20)June 13, 2023 Another characteristic of this year's retro-themed NBA Finals is that the Nuggets do not rely heavily on three-pointers. Attacking the paint has been the key to their success.</p> <p>Although the Heat had a better three-point shooting percentage than the Nuggets in the series and made three more three-pointers per game, they couldn't make up for their lack of interior presence. The Nuggets averaged 13.6 more points in the paint than the Heat in the series, making it the largest paint scoring differential among the 15 playoff series this year. It also set a new record for the largest paint scoring differential in the NBA Finals in the past 23 years. The last time there was such a disparity in interior scoring between the two teams was in the 2000 NBA Finals, where Shaquille O'Neal's Lakers averaged 21.3 more points in the paint than the Pacers.</p>"},{"location":"20230901161813918173/","title":"World Cup: Dominican Republic defeats Italy with a three-point rain by Towns, scoring 24 points and 11 rebounds","text":"<p>In the third day of the FIBA World Cup, the highly anticipated match between Dominican Republic and Italy in Group A took place   World Cup: Dominican Republic defeats Italy with a three-point rain by Towns, scoring 24 points and 11 rebounds</p> <p>In the third day of the FIBA World Cup, the highly anticipated match between Dominican Republic and Italy in Group A took place.

These countries have limited talent pool and tend to be conservative in their player selection. One example is Angola, the traditional powerhouse in Africa.</p> <p>Angola has been a regular participant in the World Cup, but their team has been slow in rejuvenating. Eduardo Mingas, who played for Angola in the 2006 FIBA World Championship, was still representing the national team at the age of 40 in 2019.</p> <p>In addition to Mingas, the previous World Cup roster also included Olimpio Cipriano, who played in the Olympics in 2004, Carlos Morais who played in the AfroBasket in 2005, and Leonel Paulo who joined the national team in 2007. Most of them were still part of the rotation in the previous World Cup.</p> <p>Although this phenomenon made the author's research easier, it also raised concerns about Angola. Mingas, the old veteran, was still an important player in the previous World Cup, but in recent years Angola has finally started the rejuvenation process. Angola does have talented players, and the squad they sent to the 2019 World Cup qualifiers was significantly different from the previous editions.</p> <p>The young players in this generation not only helped Angola achieve an impressive record of 10 wins and 2 losses in the qualifiers but also earned their spots in the World Cup roster.</p> <p>It may be the author's perception, but this new batch of Angolan players seems to be more talented. Unlike traditional African teams that rely on physicality and explosiveness, Angola's core players, led by Mingas, have a different style. Players like Armendo Costa, Felizardo Ambrossio, and Reggie Moore, who recently became a naturalized citizen, face difficulties even in dunking.</p> <p>In recent years, the newcomers who made it to Angola's rotation have shown great potential. Bruno Fernando, the first Angolan player to make it to the NBA, and Silvio De Sousa, another promising big man from the same generation, have impressed. The new generation players, Jlson Bango and Deantonio Do, may not have the same level of skills as their predecessors, but they have more talent.</p> <p>Angola, a country that once seemed to be in decline in African basketball, is now rising again. Please continue reading for their journey to the World Cup. Before the World Cup qualifiers, Angola's form was not promising. They lost to Poland and Slovenia in the Olympic qualifiers (although it was unexpected for them to win).</p> <p>In the 2021 AfroBasket, they were eliminated in the quarterfinals. Angola used to dominate the AfroBasket tournament, winning six consecutive championships from 1989 to 2009, but this time they only finished fifth.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Angola is still willing to give coach Josep Claros a chance and time. In the World Cup qualifiers, they sent a relatively unknown but talented roster, aside from a few core players. These new faces from Angola have performed exceptionally well, and with the country's passion for basketball, they have received support from fans both at home and away.</p> <p>Angolan fans are known for their passion, and they showed their support in the qualifiers. Angola started the first game with a 17-0 lead, but eventually lost by a point to the experienced Ivory Coast team.</p> <p>They struggled against Ivory Coast in their second encounter as well, losing by only two points. However, apart from Ivory Coast, they easily defeated Central African Republic and Guinea. In the qualifiers, they finished second in their group, advancing to the second round.</p> <p>In the second round, they faced Uganda, Cape Verde, and Nigeria. Angola's top player, Bruno Fernando, had already faced each of these opponents once. They dominated their opponents without mercy, winning all six games in the second round, and defeating Cape Verde, the team that eliminated them in the AfroBasket quarterfinals.</p> <p>In the second game, with Walter Tavares back in the lineup, Angola's intense defense caused Cape Verde to commit 27 turnovers with only 8 assists, effectively utilizing their physical advantage. In the end, Angola secured their spot in the World Cup in the fifth window. Please continue reading for an analysis of their playing style.</p> <p>Due to the rejuvenation process, Angola's playing style has undergone some changes. After the 2014 World Cup, they had Yannick Moriera, the shot-blocking king, as their defensive anchor. However, apart from him, most players lacked strong shot-blocking abilities. This has changed in the current World Cup. Most players in the squad have impressive jumping and shot-blocking abilities. Although some players may struggle with physicality, they will not allow easy scoring in their paint. The \"hot pot\" defense has become a common sight in Angola's highlight reels. As for the guards, with Armando Costa retiring early, Angola has given opportunities to several young guards to gain experience. Among them, Childae Dundao, who may not have an imposing physique, has stood out. Gerson Domingos and Hermangildo Santos have also had multiple experiences as starting point guards. Dundao and Domingos are both fast, but they may not have the composure of Costa.</p>"},{"location":"20230902180928867532/","title":"The World Cup next season will be held in the Philippines","text":"<p>The World Cup next season will be held in the Philippines.

Initially, it was expected that he would return at the start of the playoffs, but Ball's left knee continued to be painful, forcing him to restart the rehabilitation process, and the team decided to rest him for the remaining time this year.

It was believed that after the second surgery, he would be able to resume on-court activities this year, but that did not happen.</p> <p>Due to the inability to perform simple tasks like jumping and climbing stairs, Ball opted for cartilage transplant surgery on his left knee in March 2023, which is said to be the best option for his NBA career recovery.</p>"},{"location":"20230902181131892950/","title":"Brazil's Raul Neto will be absent for the remaining World Cup matches due to a ruptured patellar tendon","text":"<p>Brazil's Raul Neto will be absent for the remaining World Cup matches due to a ruptured patellar tendon.</p> <p>In yesterday's game between Brazil and Iran at the World Cup, former NBA player Raul Neto suffered a serious injury while driving to the basket on a fast break.

How Emoni Bates fell from being the top high school player in America.</p> <p>For those who follow the NBA draft, the term \"KD 2.0\" is not unfamiliar. Every draft, any player who is over 6 feet 9 inches tall, with long arms, a slim build, smooth shooting form, and the ability to dribble and drive to the basket, is often given this nickname. Everyone hopes for the next Kevin Durant - someone who has the height of a power forward but can play like a small forward, with precise shooting like a guard. These rare qualities make Kevin Durant a lethal offensive weapon, and many teams are eager to find a player with similar talent.</p> <p>Unlike many players who are given the \"KD 2.0\" label in college, Emoni Bates had already been highly anticipated since the age of 15. \"I was ranked as the number one player in the country since sixth grade, all the way until high school graduation.\"</p> <p>In his sophomore year, Bates received the Gatorade National Basketball Player of the Year award, becoming the youngest recipient of this honor. It's worth noting that Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Jayson Tatum, all well-known players, have also won this award in the past. This shows how promising Bates' basketball career started.</p> <p>In fact, even from a young age, Bates had a height of over 6 feet 8 inches and began professional basketball training with his father at the age of 3. This solid foundation allowed Bates to possess excellent skills rather than relying solely on his height. He developed outstanding ball-handling abilities and could quickly maneuver past defenders before they could double-team him. What's even more impressive is his smooth shooting coordination, which is not limited by his height and wingspan. This makes him a versatile player who can shoot from long range and drive to the basket. These qualities are evident in his statistics, averaging 28.7 points and 10.2 rebounds per game in his freshman year, and even scoring an incredible 43 points in a game against Bronny James, son of LeBron James.</p> <p>Such performances led the media to consider him the strongest high school player since LeBron James, and his tall shooting guard style was hailed as the next KD.</p> <p>One would expect that such talent would attract many college scholarship offers. However, many well-known teams were conservative in their approach because Bates was simply too exceptional.</p> <p>There were rumors at the time that the NBA might remove the age restriction for the 2022 season, which meant that Bates, graduating from high school, had a high chance of directly challenging the NBA. If scholarships were offered to Bates, he might not even choose to attend college. As a result, Bates decided to skip his senior year of high school and join the University of Memphis, with the plan to play one year in the NCAA before entering the NBA draft. \"Being 6 feet 9 inches tall and able to dribble doesn't mean you're the next Penny Hardaway,\" said an ESPN commentator, summarizing Bates' freshman season.</p> <p>Previously, Penny Hardaway was a tall point guard, so after witnessing Bates' potential, he actively tried to develop him into a point guard. However, Bates did not have the same level of court vision and passing skills as a true point guard. The play style of finding open teammates limited his natural scoring ability, and the experiment of playing as a point guard did not yield satisfactory results.</p> <p>Jumping straight to college, the 17-year-old Bates had to face many college players who were physically stronger and more competitive than him. This added pressure to his already slim physique and affected his offensive performance.</p> <p>This, in turn, affected the coach's decision to play him. He went from being a starter in every high school game to averaging around 23 minutes of playing time per game in his freshman year. Furthermore, Bates was also hampered by a back injury, which caused his playing time to be inconsistent throughout the season. He only played 18 games, recording an average of 9.7 points and 3.3 rebounds.</p> <p>Unlike his dominating high school years, Memphis University actually showed more stable performance when Bates was absent. This further complicated Bates' role and led him to transfer after his freshman year.</p> <p>Media outlets that once hailed Bates as the top high school player in America, with the potential to become the number one pick in the NBA draft, have now downgraded their expectations, placing him in the later stages of the first round. Just as the transfer and the struggle to adapt were ongoing, another social incident occurred, further labeling Bates as \"controversial.\"</p> <p>\"I take responsibility for my mistakes. I hope everyone will forgive me as I grow. I know this won't be my last mistake, but it will be a stain on my life. It has taught me the consequences of my immaturity.\"</p> <p>Note: This is a modified and translated version of the original text, with all editor names and photo-related descriptions removed.</p>"},{"location":"20230903105316862909/","title":"Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown has signed a record-breaking contract extension with the team, according to a report by ESPN","text":"<p>Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown has signed a record-breaking contract extension with the team, according to a report by ESPN. Brown's new contract is worth $304 million over five years, making it the highest salary in NBA history.</p> <p>Last season, Brown had a career-high average of 26.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game. He played a key role in helping the Celtics reach the Eastern Conference Finals and was selected for the All-Star Game for the first time. As a result, he earned the eligibility for a max contract extension with the Celtics.</p> <p>According to reports, Brown was selected by the Celtics as the third overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. His salary for the upcoming season will be $28.5 million, and his new extension will begin in 2024, with his salary increasing each year. He will earn an average of $60.8 million per year, doubling his current value.</p> <p>Brown's record-breaking contract exceeds the $276 million deal signed by Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic, making it the most lucrative contract in NBA history. Jokic has won the MVP award twice and led the Nuggets to their first NBA championship in the 2022-23 season, earning the NBA Finals MVP title with an average of 30.2 points, 14 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.4 steals per game.</p> <p>However, Brown's reign as the highest-paid player in the NBA may not last long, as his teammate Jayson Tatum will also be eligible to sign a supermax contract next year. The Celtics' decision to invest heavily in their players is supported by the fact that Brown and Tatum formed a formidable duo last season, averaging a combined 56.7 points per game.

After just one weekend, the league announced that Wang Zhiqun, former Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Basketball Association, would be taking over the position. The efficiency of the process can be considered quite high.</p> <p>Wang Zhiqun is not a stranger to the T1 League, as he had previously served as the head coach of the Taoyuan Leopards in the league's first season. However, he stepped down mid-season for various reasons, and veteran coach Liu Jiafa took over the team.</p> <p>After leaving the Leopards, Wang Zhiqun was recruited by the Chinese Basketball Association and served as Deputy Secretary-General. During this time, he also worked as a commentator for various leagues and utilized his own YouTube channel, \"5 After Time,\" as a platform for self-media, which can be considered quite successful. Please continue reading below.</p> <p>Wang Zhiqun has a comprehensive basketball background. He was a key player for the Dacin Tigers in the past and later coached at the first-tier level in the University Basketball Association (UBA) at Taiwan Normal University. After the establishment of the Taoyuan Leopards, he also became the team's first head coach, possessing the qualifications of a professional team head coach. Following that, he joined the basketball association as Deputy Secretary-General, responsible for national team training and assisting Secretary-General Li Yunxiang, with additional experience in uniform management.</p> <p>In the T1 League's system, the Secretary-General can be considered the most important position, especially in an association-based structure where the President and Vice President are honorary roles. The Secretary-General is essentially responsible for the overall operation of the league and plays a crucial role in communicating with the Director of Competition and the Director of Strategic Marketing.</p> <p>Therefore, it is a smart move to have Wang Zhiqun, who has a complete background and a fresh image, take over as Secretary-General.</p> <p>The new Secretary-General of the T1 League is Wang Zhiqun, former Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Basketball Association. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Regarding his appointment as the league's Secretary-General, Wang Zhiqun expressed, \"Observing the league's development over the past year, it has been progressing in the right direction. Returning to the league, I hope to not only ensure stable development but also promote internationalization, fostering cooperation between the league and other countries, with the aim of significantly enhancing the league's international visibility.\" Regarding internal reforms in the league, Wang Zhiqun also emphasized, \"In the future, we will strengthen communication between the league and teams, with the ultimate goal of mutual benefit, and prioritize the interests of the fans to create a diverse and comprehensive professional basketball environment.\" T1 League President Qian Weijuan said, \"Zhiqun's young and promising image in the basketball industry is recognized by everyone. We can see from his attitude towards basketball during his time as a player and coach that he will develop his own style. The position of Secretary-General has been passed down from one capable individual to another, and each one is outstanding!\" Indeed, as President Qian mentioned, the position of Secretary-General is a baton that is passed on. From the beginning, Zhang Yunzhi, the founder of a marketing company, helped the league establish its footing in the first year. In the second year, media professional Zhang Shuren collaborated with the newly joined Director of Strategic Marketing, Cai Shanghua, leading to significant advancements in marketing. In the third year, Wang Zhiqun, with a background in basketball and experience as a coach and in uniform management, took over, raising high expectations for his future performance.

After a three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Jones Cup returned this year, inviting the University of California Irvine (UCI) to represent the United States. Turner, who has been coaching at UCI since 2010, set foot on the island once again. The last time he was here, as Turner mentioned, was 27 years ago in 1996. That year, the Jones Cup also had a team from the United States, consisting of stars from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) of the NCAA. Turner, who was then an assistant coach at Wake Forest University, accompanied the US team as an assistant coach. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Since this is not Turner's first time participating in the Jones Cup, he has a deep understanding of the competition and schedule. Although it may not be a tournament with points and official records, it is still a special and meaningful challenge for NCAA teams to have teams from various Asian countries participating. \"Playing eight games in nine days, just like playing eleven games in twelve days back then, is a very intense schedule that puts us to the test. In mid-August, many universities in the US have already started their new semester, but UCI is still on vacation due to scheduling, so it is the perfect time for us to have this training before the start of the school year.\"</p> <p>About two months before the Jones Cup, UCI had already announced on the university's website that their basketball team would participate. NCAA regulations allow each school to have an international program once every four years, and UCI chose the Jones Cup as their journey this time. \"Many people in the NCAA only watch American basketball,\" Turner said. \"The United States is certainly the best country in basketball, but basketball is not limited to one style. Different countries, different talents, and different strategies require NCAA players to learn in order to understand how basketball operates in various ways.\"</p> <p>Although UCI started the Jones Cup with three victories, scoring over a hundred points and winning by more than 60 points in each game, Turner believes that this does not mean they are a superpower far superior to other teams or that UCI finds the Jones Cup unchallenging. \"Many of our players are seeing how Asian teams play for the first time. In fact, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and other teams played better as the tournament went on. The content that beat us on the first day may not truly reflect their strength. We just had enough manpower this time and were able to change strategies based on the game situation. We performed very well in the Jones Cup, even better than I expected. That's why we won.\"</p> <p>UCI brought a roster of 17 players to the Jones Cup this time. Turner stated that they usually maintain a squad of 16 players for the school team, but they brought an extra player this time to meet the depth requirements for intensive games and to adapt to different countries' tactics. Among the six players over 205 cm, four are over 210 cm, which exceeded Turner's original plan for a lineup with at least two players on the court, maintaining a \"twin tower\" formation. However, Turner changed the formation to one big and four small players when he believed that space on the court and defensive matchups were more important. The forwards performed well and met his expectations, which was the best aspect of their performance in the Jones Cup.</p> <p>Over twenty years ago, when Turner was an assistant coach at Wake Forest University, he later moved to Stanford from 2000 to 2004. In 2004, he joined the NBA's Golden State Warriors as an assistant coach before leaving the NBA and becoming the head coach at UCI in 2010. For Turner, although the title of head coach is higher than that of an assistant coach, the educational significance that a university coach can bring is more important than professional basketball. \"Compared to professional basketball, college coaches can have a greater influence on players. College players may not be mature, but college coaches don't necessarily have to immediately help players get better contracts. Instead, they can help them grow from boys to better men through their presence on the court. Of course, I still need to help the team win in college, but if I can help players become better individuals and bring more positive energy to them and their environment, that would be an achievement as a college coach,\" Turner said.</p> <p>In Turner's philosophy, winning is certainly important in basketball. Whether it's his original twin tower formation or the lineup with the tallest starting lineup in NCAA history at 7 feet 6 inches and the shortest at 6 feet 8 inches, Turner wants to convey more than just winning to his players. \"When I first came to UCI, there wasn't a single player taller than me (6 feet 7 inches). We played fast, like Asian teams. Now, I usually play with two big men and we can still win. What I want to say is that basketball is always related to physique and skills. You can have an advantage because of a better physique or better skills than others, but the most beautiful thing on the basketball court is that you always have different ways to become better. As long as you specialize in your own path to success, you can make wonderful things come true.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230903105531281177/","title":"NBALonzoBall confirms absence for the new season, optimistic about post-surgery recovery","text":"<p>Today, Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball discussed his injury issues on a podcast with Trae Young, where he revealed that he will be missing the entire 2023-24 season    NBALonzoBall confirms absence for the new season, optimistic about post-surgery recovery</p> <p>Today, Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball discussed his injury issues on a podcast with Trae Young, where he revealed that he will be missing the entire 2023-24 season.</p> <p>\"I just underwent a major surgery, and I hope this is the last surgery I have to go through,\" Ball said on Young's podcast, \"From the Point.\"</p> <p>\"It's been a long process.

I always knew my son was talented, but this feels like waking up from a dream,\" Karri Kuzma told Andscape. So, what's next for Karri Kuzma, who will retire at such a young age? She will oversee the Kyle Kuzma Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping children, young people, and families through sports, education, and life experiences.

Dozier. \"Well, I was nervous in my first Summer League game. I came off the bench and scored 9 points with 4 rebounds against the LA Clippers.

Our shooting percentage did not reach the required level, and we did not have enough free throws. These are the issues we need to address.\" Three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Gobert, stated that despite the absence of Yuta Watanabe and Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura, he and the French team were not surprised by Japan's intensity in the first half. \"They are a team with many shooters and fast players,\" said Gobert. \"The first quarter was a bit tough, but later on, we were able to recover and become more physical, dominating our game.\" In the next game, France will continue their warm-up matches against Australia, a contender for the World Cup medals, at the same venue in Tokyo.</p>"},{"location":"20230904103542467061/","title":"Dominican Republic's Karl-Anthony Towns led his team to a surprising victory over Italy in the FIBA World Cup","text":"<p>Dominican Republic's Karl-Anthony Towns led his team to a surprising victory over Italy in the FIBA World Cup.

The video showed his expression of resignation.

In addition to the shocking Bradley Beal trade that shocked the entire league, they have also signed Drew Eubanks, Keita Bates-Diop (KBD), Chimezie Metu, Yuta Watanabe, and Eric Gordon in free agency, and reached contract extensions with Josh Okogie and Damion Lee.</p> <p>After finalizing their roster for the upcoming season, the Suns have made some adjustments through signings and trades. They first sent backup point guard Cam Payne along with a second-round pick to the Spurs in exchange for a protected future second-round pick. They then acquired 23-year-old forward Bol Bol, who was recently released by the Magic, and made a trade involving draft rights with the Magic.</p> <p>Bol Bol, like Eubanks, KBD, Metu, and Watanabe, is a versatile forward who can play multiple positions in the frontcourt. However, he stands out with his unique attributes. Standing at 7'2\" (approximately 218 cm) with a wingspan of 7'8\" (approximately 234 cm), Bol possesses a combination of size and skills that is reminiscent of this year's top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama (who is 7'4\" with a wingspan of 7'10\").</p> <p>Bol had his best season in the league last year while playing for the Magic. In 70 games, he averaged 9.1 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks, all career highs. However, his performance fluctuated throughout the season.</p> <p>In the first two and a half months of the season, Bol played 37 games, starting in 32 of them, and averaged 26.1 minutes per game. During this period, he contributed an average of 12.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, and shot 58.8% from the field. However, as injured players like Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, and Jalen Suggs returned to the Magic lineup in 2023, Bol's playing time and production decreased. In the next 33 games, he only started in one game and saw his playing time reduced by 10 minutes, resulting in averages of 5.8 points and 4.3 rebounds.</p> <p>One area where Bol's performance was affected by inconsistent playing time was his three-point shooting. In the first two and a half months of the season, he had a catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage of 38.1%. However, after 2023, his three-point shooting percentage dropped significantly to 8.6%. Despite this, Bol still possesses unique abilities.</p> <p>His height and smooth shooting touch make him difficult to stop on cuts to the basket, as he ranks in the top 5% of the league in efficiency on cuts. Additionally, his height and wingspan give him an advantage in grabbing offensive rebounds, with Bol's putback efficiency also ranking in the top 5% of the league. Furthermore, his exceptional ball-handling skills allow him to initiate fast breaks and make decisions whether to attack the rim or take a quick pull-up jumper from beyond the three-point line.</p> <p>Bol was involved in 27.6% of the Magic's offensive possessions during the transition from defense to offense, ranking 15th in the league and higher than any player on the Suns. Unlike most big men who typically serve as screeners in pick-and-roll situations, Bol's ball-handling skills allow him to be the primary ball handler in those situations. In today's positionless basketball, where big men handle the ball and forwards and guards interchange positions, it is not uncommon. Bol's usage as the ball handler in pick-and-roll situations is even higher than Nikola Jokic's, who is known for initiating Invert P&amp;R. Bol's usage as the primary ball handler in pick-and-roll situations is at 8.6%, which is the highest among 7-footers in the league.</p> <p>In summary, Bol Bol's versatile abilities in shooting, cutting, and passing make him a valuable asset for the coaching staff in terms of tactical adjustments on offense. However, his impact on the defensive end may be limited. Despite his height of over 220 cm, his thin frame hinders his effectiveness as a defender. Within a 6-foot radius of the basket, his differential percentage was only 1.1% last season. This means that when he defended opponents near the basket, their shooting percentage not only did not decrease but actually increased by 1.1%. This statistic ranked him seventh to last among all 7-footers in the league last season.</p>"},{"location":"20230904111338064224/","title":"San Antonio Spurs Win Top Pick in NBA Draft Lottery, Set to Select French Star Victor Wembanyama","text":"<p>The San Antonio Spurs have won the top pick in the NBA draft lottery, giving them the opportunity to select the highly touted French player, Victor Wembanyama.

Standing at 7 feet 5 inches (226 cm) tall with an 8-foot wingspan (243 cm), Wembanyama possesses exceptional physical attributes and skills, including a guard-like shooting touch and forward-like mobility. He has been hailed as the undisputed top choice for the first pick for the past five months.</p> <p>Wembanyama becomes the third player in Spurs history to be selected as the first overall pick, following David Robinson in 1987 and Tim Duncan in 1997. Both of these legendary centers helped the Spurs win NBA championships. Now, the responsibility falls on Wembanyama's shoulders as the Spurs aim to capture their sixth NBA championship, with their last title coming in the 2013-14 season. The Spurs have also decided to extend the contract of their 74-year-old legendary coach Gregg Popovich for three more years, hoping to leverage his experience coaching French players like Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to assist Wembanyama in adapting quickly to the intensity and lifestyle of the NBA.</p> <p>After being selected as the first overall pick, Wembanyama shed tears of joy. In an interview with ESPN, he said, \"When I heard the NBA commissioner call my name, it was like realizing my lifelong dream. I have dreamed about this moment so many times, which is why I cried.\" </p> <p>Brandon Miller, the second overall pick, stands at 6 feet 9 inches (205 cm) tall and possesses elite 3D physical attributes. He is the only player among the top three picks who played in a US college. Although he was chosen by the Charlotte Hornets, ESPN reported that during his workout with the Hornets, Miller told the team's owner and basketball legend Michael Jordan that Jordan was not his idol and that he had rarely watched Jordan play. Miller's journey to becoming the second pick was full of twists and turns. Just a year ago, he was projected to be a second-round pick or even go undrafted. However, Miller improved his skills and played for the number one seed Alabama University in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, propelling him into lottery territory.</p> <p>However, in February of this year, Miller was unexpectedly involved in a shooting incident with one of his college teammates. Although he was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing, it nearly cost him his basketball career.</p> <p>Han Dosen, who stands at just 188 cm tall but possesses explosive athleticism, had a great chance of becoming the top pick in this year's draft if it weren't for Wembanyama. Han is praised for his passing vision, excellent physical condition, and leadership qualities on the court. Besides needing to improve his three-point shooting, he has few weaknesses and is highly likely to become a highly regarded rookie in the league.</p> <p>Han played in all 19 games as a starter in the development league this year, averaging 16.5 points and 6.8 assists per game. However, his three-point shooting percentage was only 27.5%. It remains to be seen whether the Portland Trail Blazers, who selected Han, will initiate another trade involving their star player Damian Lillard, or whether they will pair him with Han to form a backcourt duo.

He will be playing for SC Rasta Vechta in the second tier of the German league next season.</p> <p>In addition to trash talking Reaves, there were also scenes of celebration captured after the game. Again, it was Vaidas Kariniauskas who was seen wearing a Team USA hat in the locker room. This sparked discussions among the public. The United States suffered a loss against Lithuania yesterday, falling behind by a significant margin in the first half. They made an effort to catch up in the second half but fell short. They only secured a second-place finish in their group and will face Italy in the quarterfinals.</p>"},{"location":"20230907015703513886/","title":"Jeremy Lin Confirmed to Join PLG Kaohsiung Steel in Taiwan, Supports the Great Southern Project to Address the Imbalance in Taiwan's Basketball Scene","text":"<p>PLG Kaohsiung Steel, a team in the P   Jeremy Lin Confirmed to Join PLG Kaohsiung Steel in Taiwan, Supports the Great Southern Project to Address the Imbalance in Taiwan's Basketball Scene</p> <p>PLG Kaohsiung Steel, a team in the P. LEAGUE+ basketball league, announced today that Taiwanese-American former NBA star Jeremy Lin will be joining their team. Lin, who is currently in the United States, posted a photoshopped image of himself wearing the number 7 jersey on social media and wrote, \"Kaohsiung, I'm coming.\"</p> <p>Rumors of Lin joining the Taiwanese professional basketball league have been circulating since the end of last year, but the team had not confirmed it until now. The announcement by PLG Kaohsiung Steel on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year has once again shaken up Taiwan's basketball scene. The 2022-23 season of the Taiwanese professional basketball league has been full of surprises. The Taoyuan Yungshin Leopards of the Taiwan e-Sports Basketball League recently signed Dwight Howard, an NBA All-Star who has been selected eight times, and now PLG has recruited Jeremy Lin, who is highly popular in Taiwan. This sets the stage for a showdown between the two basketball stars.</p> <p>News of Lin's return to Taiwan to play basketball has been brewing since last year. However, at that time, he was still playing for the Guangzhou Long Lions in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). It wasn't until the end of last year when he announced his departure from the CBA that his return to Taiwan gained attention again. Lin's younger brother, Lin Shu-Wei, currently plays for the New Taipei City Kings, a team in the PLG league. Lin Shu-Wei previously expressed his hope of playing alongside his brother during their professional careers. Although they won't be playing on the same team, they will soon have the opportunity to face each other in the same league, taking a big step towards their \"reunion.\" In addition to posting a photo of himself wearing the Steel jersey on social media, Jeremy Lin wrote, \"Kaohsiung, I'm coming.\" Many fans expressed their support online, with one fan writing, \"Welcome to Kaohsiung! Kaohsiung people will support you till the end.\" Another fan wrote, \"Taiwan welcomes you back to play basketball,\" showing their joy and support for Lin's return to Taiwan.</p> <p>PLG Kaohsiung Steel officially announced the recruitment of Taiwanese-American basketball star Jeremy Lin. Recognizing the long-standing imbalance between the basketball scenes in northern and southern Taiwan, Lin Lin has embraced the Steel's \"Great Southern Project\" and hopes to contribute to the team's success. Jeremy Lin, who sparked the \"Linsanity\" phenomenon in the NBA, has played in top professional leagues such as the NBA and CBA for many years. He ended his contract with the CBA early last year and decided to return to Taiwan after the Lunar New Year. Lin's NBA journey was not without obstacles. Although he signed contracts with the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets, he did not have many opportunities to play. He went back and forth between the NBA and the development league until he joined the New York Knicks in 2012. During a game, he scored a career-high of 25 points, along with 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals, leading the team to victory and attracting attention from fans. In subsequent games, Lin continued to deliver impressive performances, scoring double-doubles against star guards like John Wall and a career-high of 38 points against the late Kobe Bryant. The \"Linsanity\" phenomenon became a hot topic in the global basketball community and Lin appeared on the cover of Time magazine and was named one of the TIME 100 most influential people in 2012.</p> <p>After nearly ten years of playing in the NBA, Lin won an NBA championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019 and then decided to join the CBA, signing with the Beijing Ducks. He averaged 22.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. Wherever Lin went, whether it was a home or away game, the arenas were always packed with fans cheering for him. Ending his contract early last year, he joined the Kaohsiung Steel after the Lunar New Year this year. The Kaohsiung Steel team stated in a press release that the \"Linsanity\" phenomenon was not a coincidence. Besides Lin's high level of self-discipline and determination, he never gave up and was always ready for opportunities. During the Knicks' losing streak, Lin seized the chance and led the team to overcome adversity, achieving a winning streak and entering the playoffs, proving himself with his performance. This situation is similar to the current state of the Kaohsiung Steel team.</p> <p>With Jeremy Lin joining the Steel, he is expected to become the team's new offensive leader, filling the gap in experience in the team's backcourt. In addition to providing substantial support to the team, Lin's presence will also benefit rising star point guard Chen Yu-Wei and versatile guard Wang Lu-Xiang, who are being nurtured by the team.</p> <p>As the only team in southern Taiwan in the P. LEAGUE+ league, the Kaohsiung Steel joined the league last year and has been actively promoting the \"Great Southern Project\" to address the long-standing resource imbalance in Taiwan's basketball scene between the north and the south. The addition of Jeremy Lin and his support will further advance the Steel's \"Great Southern Project.\"</p> <p>Jeremy Lin, a devout Christian, has had a long-standing connection with the Fengshan Gymnasium in Kaohsiung, the home stadium of the Steel. In 2016, he shared his life experiences and faith with nearly 5,000 churchgoers and fans in a testimony titled \"Unceasing Breakthroughs in Life.\" After becoming an NBA player, Lin faced many challenges and discrimination, but he adjusted his pace and bravely confronted the obstacles.</p> <p>According to the team's general manager, Gao Jingyan, Lin's sense of responsibility and mission for both himself and the overall development of basketball played a key role in his decision to join. He recognized that basketball development in Taiwan has been concentrated in the north, while the south has been relatively less vibrant. He hopes that his joining the team can change the viewing habits of basketball fans in southern Taiwan and bring more resources and change to the southern market. Lin's basketball career has always been about challenging the impossible. Despite being undrafted in the NBA draft and facing skepticism due to his Asian heritage, he successfully entered the NBA and established his value and market. Now, by joining the Kaohsiung Steel, fans are hoping that he can replicate the success of \"Linsanity\" and become the team's savior.</p> <p>[Join Key Opinion Network] Get exciting articles delivered to your inbox every day, exclusive editor's picks, current affairs selections, arts and culture reports, and more.

Among the international teams, Bundang Business High School from Korea, also known as the \"Korean High School Empress,\" has gained a reputation for its dominance in the Korean high school basketball scene. It has also played a significant role in the development of professional women's basketball in Korea and the nurturing of national team players. Despite its relatively short history, Bundang Business High School has quickly risen to become one of the strongest women's basketball teams in Korea. Since its establishment in December 2007, it has achieved remarkable success, including a third-place finish in the 2010 National Federation Chairman Basketball Championship and a silver medal in the 92nd National Sports Festival in 2011.

However, by the standards set by the basketball world, the USA team, as the number one basketball power in the world, was expected to be the favored side. But Lithuania refused to give up. They once again put the USA team in a position of falling behind at the start of the game. Unlike the previous five opponents of the USA in the World Cup, Lithuania was different in that they only allowed the USA team to lead for 1 minute and 18 seconds in the first two minutes of the game. Even though the USA team made a strong comeback in the second half, Lithuania did not allow them to make any progress and ultimately defeated the star-studded American team with a score of 110-104, maintaining their undefeated record in the World Cup and handing the USA team their first loss in this tournament.</p> <p>Since the Rio Olympics in 2016, the United States has failed to maintain a perfect record in their three most recent international competitions. Please continue reading. Of course, we cannot deny that Lithuania was exceptionally accurate in this game. They were already the most accurate three-point shooting team in the World Cup so far. But today, they not only made 6 out of 6 three-pointers in the first quarter, but also made 14 three-pointers throughout the game, with contributions from 9 different players, including their main center Jonas Valanciunas. In the fourth quarter, with 3 minutes and 52 seconds remaining, Mindaugas Kuzminskas made a difficult three-pointer with Anthony Edwards closely defending him, and with 1 minute and 43 seconds left, Tomas Dimsa successfully hit another three-pointer to extend their lead to 11 points. These two crucial three-pointers dealt a heavy blow to the USA team. Strictly speaking, the USA team's defense had almost no loopholes, but Lithuania still managed to score, as if it was meant to be. They ultimately made the USA team's efforts to catch up in vain.</p> <p>Focusing only on the three-pointers would be overlooking Lithuania's true strength. Center Jonas Valanciunas has always been challenged by NBA teams due to his weakness in defending against high pick-and-rolls. However, under FIBA rules that allow zone defense and allow centers to dominate in the paint, Valanciunas has become a powerful and versatile player with strong low-post offensive skills. Coupled with the synergy and basketball IQ developed from long-term collaboration with the national team, he is a dominant center under FIBA rules. Just like Nikola Vucevic, the main center of Montenegro in the USA team's previous game, both players have shown their brilliance on the FIBA court, allowing the world to see the talent of European star centers. Additionally, Lithuania's shortest player is 6 feet 4 inches, and all their guards have strong defensive abilities. The post players, including Valanciunas, provide solid support and tough defense. Lithuania's strategic positioning and aggressive playstyle, with active movement off the ball and everyone prepared for both offense and defense, make them a formidable force on the world stage, even without the NBA star Domantas Sabonis. Please continue reading. This was fully demonstrated in their competition against the United States. Of course, the unbelievable three-point shooting in the first quarter helped them quickly establish a significant lead. However, the key to Lithuania's victory throughout the game was their aggressive style of play, as mentioned earlier. They established an early advantage in rebounds and off-ball offensive rebounds, with the USA starting lineup, apart from the tall Jaren Jackson Jr. and the strong Edwards, being outmatched in three of the four positions against Lithuania. Even though the USA second unit had Tyrese Haliburton and Brandon Ingram, who are relatively outstanding in terms of physical attributes for their positions, Lithuania always found ways to exploit Austin Reaves with team defense. Lithuania outrebounded the USA with 43 rebounds compared to 27, and had a 17-2 scoring advantage in the second unit. This included Kuzminskas grabbing an offensive rebound and scoring near the end of the third quarter, allowing Lithuania to maintain a safe distance from the USA team's second unit in the fourth quarter. Fortunately, Lithuania had accumulated enough second unit offensive firepower in the first three quarters to maintain their lead. Otherwise, with just one more offensive rebound and score, the USA team's comeback attempt could have been successful. As for the USA, in the preliminary games, to address Ingram's slump, Josh Hart replaced Ingram in the starting lineup, forming a Villanova championship connection with Mikal Bridges and Jalen Brunson. However, this starting lineup was clearly a \"one big and four small\" lineup with no room for ambiguity. This also indicates that only Edwards was the main offensive threat. Bridges and Hart, although praised in recent years as \"functional wing players,\" or Bridges' offensive breakthrough since joining the Nets making him \"more than just a functional player,\" fundamentally, they are not like Valanciunas, who can dismantle opponents' defense with power in the low post, or superstars like Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, or at least Dwyane Wade, who can score at a high level in elite competitions. Indeed, from the USA team's starting lineup and the selection of the entire team, we can see that the USA has many outstanding functional players.

In his rookie season, Gasol averaged 17.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 2.7 assists, making him the undeniable cornerstone of the Grizzlies' rebuilding efforts.</p> <p>Gasol did live up to expectations, leading the team to their first playoff appearance in his third year. However, they faced strong Western Conference teams like the Spurs, Suns, and Mavericks and struggled to secure a win, being swept in the first round three times and leaving behind a playoff record of 0 wins and 12 losses.</p> <p>Unable to break through to the next level and plagued by Gasol's injuries, the team found themselves in a desperate situation. In the middle of the 2008 season, they traded Gasol to the Lakers for a rebuilding effort, and in return acquired his younger brother, Marc Gasol. When Marc joined the team as a second-round rookie before the 08-09 season, he was a relatively unknown player. However, no one expected that he, along with the young point guard Mike Conley and the disgruntled forward Zach Randolph, acquired in a trade the following summer, would create a formidable Grizzlies team in the Western Conference. Photo Credit: AP/ Getty Images/ In the NBA Summer League on July 15th, the Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves. Starting from their legendary upset of the top-seeded Spurs in 2011, the Grizzlies became a force to be reckoned with in the Western Conference. Despite never making it past the Western Conference Finals, they have consistently posed a challenge to division champions such as the Spurs, Warriors, and Thunder. To reach the final stage, teams often have to go through the Grizzlies. Just like the blue-collar atmosphere of Memphis, the Grizzlies' playing style has always been tough, resilient, and relentless. Despite being in a small market, the Grizzlies' strong connection with the local fans is deepened. Players like Conley and Randolph, who are beloved by fans, are both actively involved in community work and have been recipients of the NBA Cares Community Assist Award (Conley has even won it twice). It's not hard to imagine the Grizzlies' position in Memphis.</p> <p>Please continue reading below. As the only major professional sports team in Memphis, the organization is dedicated to fostering community relationships. In addition to actively participating in local education, youth development, health, and fitness initiatives, they are also committed to enhancing the fan experience.

However, accessing the internet inside an enclosed arena is not as straightforward as we might think.</p> <p>The size and design of the venue can create various factors that disrupt signal reception, while the large crowd absorbs radio frequencies, making signal transmission difficult.

Lin, who is currently in the United States, posted a photoshopped image of himself wearing the number 7 jersey on social media with the caption, \"Kaohsiung, I'm coming.\" Rumors of Lin joining the Taiwanese professional basketball league have been circulating since the end of last year, but the team had not confirmed until now. The announcement by P. LEAGUE+ Kaohsiung Steel on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year has once again made a splash in Taiwan's basketball scene. The 2022-23 season of the Taiwanese professional basketball league is full of surprises. The Taoyuan Yongfeng Clouded Leopards of the neighboring Taiwan xT1 League first brought in \"The Beast\" Dwight Howard, an eight-time NBA All-Star. Now, PLG has also recruited the highly popular Jeremy Lin in Taiwan, creating a situation where two star players will face off. </p> <p>News of Lin's return to Taiwan to play basketball had been circulating since last year, but at that time, he was still playing for the Guangzhou Loong Lions in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). It wasn't until the end of last year when he announced his decision to leave the CBA that his return to Taiwan gained attention once again. Lin's younger brother, Lin Shu-wei, currently plays for the New Taipei Kings, a team ranking high in the PLG standings. Lin Shu-wei has expressed his desire to play alongside his brother during their professional careers. Although they won't be playing on the same team, they will soon have the opportunity to compete against each other in the same league, taking a big step towards their \"union.\"</p> <p>In addition to posting a photo of himself wearing the Kaohsiung Steel jersey on social media, Lin also wrote, \"Kaohsiung, I'm coming.\" Many fans have shown their support online, with one fan writing, \"Welcome to Kaohsiung, the people of Kaohsiung will support you to the end.\" Another fan wrote, \"Taiwan welcomes you back to play basketball,\" expressing their joy and support for Lin's return. P. LEAGUE+ Kaohsiung Steel officially announced the recruitment of Taiwanese basketball star Jeremy Lin. Lin identifies with the team's \"Great Southern Project\" which aims to address the long-standing imbalance between the north and south of Taiwan's basketball scene, and he hopes to contribute to the Kaohsiung Steel's success.</p> <p>Lin, who sparked \"Linsanity\" in the NBA, has played in top professional leagues such as the NBA and CBA for many years. He terminated his contract with the CBA's Beijing Ducks at the end of last year and decided to return to Taiwan after the Lunar New Year. Lin's NBA journey was not without its challenges. Although he signed contracts with the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets, he did not have much playing time and had to make several trips in and out of the development league. It wasn't until 2012 when he joined the New York Knicks that he seized the opportunity and scored a career-high 25 points, along with 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals, leading the team to end their losing streak and capturing the attention of fans. In subsequent games, Lin continued to deliver impressive performances, achieving double-double statistics against star guards like John Wall and scoring a career-high 38 points against the late Kobe Bryant. The \"Linsanity\" phenomenon became a hot topic in the global basketball community, and Lin even appeared on the cover of TIME magazine and was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2012.</p> <p>After nearly 10 years of playing in the NBA, Lin won the championship with the Toronto Raptors in 2019 and then joined the CBA's Beijing Ducks, averaging 22.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. Wherever Lin went, whether it was as a home or away player, he attracted a full house and became the center of attention. He terminated his contract at the end of last year and joined the Kaohsiung Steel after the Lunar New Year. The Kaohsiung Steel team stated in a press release that the \"Linsanity\" phenomenon was not a coincidence. In addition to Lin's high level of self-discipline and determination, he never gave up and was always ready to seize opportunities. When the New York Knicks were in a losing streak, Lin took advantage of the opportunity and led the team to overcome adversity, achieving a winning streak and entering the playoffs, proving himself with actual performance. The team sees parallels between Lin's situation back then and the current situation of the Kaohsiung Steel. </p> <p>After joining the Kaohsiung Steel, Jeremy Lin is expected to become the team's new offensive weapon, filling the gap in the team's lack of experienced backcourt players. In addition to providing the team with tangible strength, Lin's presence can also provide more support and development opportunities for the team's rising star point guard Chen Yu-wei and versatile guard Wang Lu-xiang.</p> <p>As the only team in southern Taiwan in the P. LEAGUE+, Kaohsiung Steel joined the league last year and has been actively promoting the \"Great Southern Project\" in an effort to gradually address the long-standing resource imbalance in Taiwan's basketball scene between the north and south. With Jeremy Lin's addition and support, the Kaohsiung Steel's \"Great Southern Project\" can take a big step forward.</p> <p>Jeremy Lin, a devout Christian, has had a longstanding connection with the Fengshan Gymnasium, the home court of the Kaohsiung Steel. In 2016, he shared his life experiences and testimony under the theme of \"Lin's Life of Constant Breakthrough\" with nearly 5,000 churchgoers and fans, sharing the power of faith in his life. After becoming an NBA player, Lin faced many challenges and discrimination, but he adjusted his pace and bravely faced challenges.</p> <p>According to GM Gao Jing-yan, the main reason for Jeremy Lin's decision to join the team is his sense of responsibility and mission towards himself and the overall development of basketball. He is well aware that basketball development in Taiwan has always been concentrated in the north, while the south has been relatively less vibrant. He hopes that his joining the team can change the viewing habits of basketball fans in southern Taiwan and bring more resources and change to the southern market.</p> <p>Jeremy Lin's basketball career has always been about challenging the impossible. When he went undrafted and made it to the NBA as an Asian-American player despite being underestimated, he proved his worth and value. Now, with his decision to join the Kaohsiung Steel, fans are eagerly awaiting whether he can replicate the success of \"Linsanity\" in the NBA and transform into the team's savior.</p>"},{"location":"20230907094538342596/","title":"NBA Eastern Conference Finals: Celtics Stage Epic Comeback, Tie Series with Heat at 3-3","text":"<p>The Boston Celtics, who were once down 0-3 in the Eastern Conference Finals, narrowly defeated the Miami Heat with a score of 104-103 in a nail-biting game on the 28th    NBA Eastern Conference Finals: Celtics Stage Epic Comeback, Tie Series with Heat at 3-3</p> <p>The Boston Celtics, who were once down 0-3 in the Eastern Conference Finals, narrowly defeated the Miami Heat with a score of 104-103 in a nail-biting game on the 28th.

However, he had a remarkable comeback in the fourth quarter, scoring 15 points, including three free throws in the final 3 seconds that briefly gave the Heat a 1-point lead. But Marcus Smart missed a three-pointer in the final seconds, and Derrick White made a last-second shot to secure the victory for the Celtics.</p> <p>In the history of the NBA playoffs, no team has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit to win a series. However, the Celtics have shown incredible resilience by winning three consecutive games after losing the first three. If they can win Game 7 at home on the 30th, they will make history. Jayson Tatum had a game-high 31 points and 11 rebounds for the Celtics, while Jaylen Brown contributed 26 points and 10 rebounds. Marcus Smart provided a boost with 21 points.

Fortunately, he was promptly taken to the hospital and is now out of intensive care.</p> <p>However, this incident may jeopardize his efforts thus far. As the son of LeBron, Bronny has always faced more attention and pressure compared to other \"baller offspring.\" Being the \"Heir to the Throne,\" his basketball talent is naturally scrutinized under a larger microscope. However, compared to his father's dominance during high school, Bronny's skills are not as impressive. Although he possesses good natural abilities, he has not displayed the same level of dominance as his father did in high school. At one point, he was even considered a \"product of his father.\" Despite facing criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continuously improved his skills. In his senior season, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, earning him a spot in the McDonald's All-American team and the title of a five-star high school player by some basketball media outlets. He also received basketball scholarships from some top NCAA Division I schools.</p> <p>These achievements significantly boosted Bronny's draft projection, transforming him from a potential undrafted player to someone with a chance to be a first-round or even lottery pick.</p> <p>Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father's reputation. LeBron himself has hinted that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, there is a high chance he would join his son's team and play together. This \"father follows son\" scenario undoubtedly impacts Bronny's stock, but it should not overshadow his own efforts. He ultimately chose the University of Southern California and plans to enter the draft after completing his freshman season. Before enrolling, he posted on his social media, expressing his determination to prove the doubters wrong.</p> <p>However, the heart issue that arose before the start of the new college season casts a shadow over his future. Just like Bronny, this situation reminds me of another \"baller offspring,\" Shareef O'Neal, the son of basketball star Shaquille O'Neal.</p> <p>During high school, Shareef achieved notable success and was regarded as a four-star high school player by sports media. He also planned to enter the NBA after completing his freshman season. However, his heart abnormality was discovered during his freshman year, and there was a high probability of it posing a life-threatening risk, requiring immediate surgery. Shareef had to rest and rehabilitate for a whole 11 months, which was detrimental to his growth as an emerging player.</p> <p>Losing a year during the crucial development period can result in a significant gap in skills and competitiveness. With Shareef's condition, playing in the more intense NCAA was already challenging. Coaches, concerned about the risk of the condition recurring and considering the team's performance, did not give Shareef much playing time. As a result, his college performance declined drastically, and he ultimately faced the fate of going undrafted.</p> <p>\"I always tell Shareef that he will never be the next me. I want him to play his own game, his own style,\" said Shaquille. \"Unfortunately, he has to carry the O'Neal name, but he still needs to create his own path.\" Shareef is currently waiting for an opportunity in the developmental league. Despite averaging only 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the previous season, overcoming the shadow of his heart condition is a significant progress. Shaquille encourages his son not to be defined by his father's achievements and fame and to bravely pursue his chosen path.</p> <p>LeBron likely shares a similar perspective on Bronny, as his love for his child remains unwavering regardless of his draft position. He also hopes that Bronny can overcome any injury setbacks and showcase his worth in the upcoming season. This article, authorized by the author, was originally published here.

Please continue reading as the Raptors, at great cost, found their claw (The KLAW), and the Spurs received an offer they couldn't refuse, exchanging a top five player in the league for a strong reinforcement who was selected to the All-NBA Second Team this season. Please continue reading as we explore this accurately calculated risk. </p> <p>Since being swept by the Cavaliers this year, head coach Dwane Casey was sadly fired, and many experts believe that the Raptors, who have been dominating the Eastern Conference, have reached their limit in terms of building a championship team. Despite LeBron James' journey to the West, the rise of the 76ers and Celtics, and the presence of the Bucks and Pacers led by Antetokounmpo and Oladipo, the Raptors are facing tough competition.</p> <p>In comparison, the Raptors, whose core players are entering their prime, not only lack future prospects compared to other competitive teams, but also locked in their future by re-signing Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka last year.</p> <p>For Raptors' General Manager Masai Ujiri, there is no better opportunity for a major breakthrough than acquiring Kawhi Leonard, a top five player in the league just one year ago, a two-time MVP, and a former Defensive Player of the Year.</p> <p>If Kyle Lowry's enthusiasm and the $50 million difference can successfully convince Leonard to re-sign next summer, his age and dominant offensive and defensive abilities will definitely allow the Raptors to compete with the powerhouses in the Eastern Conference. If Leonard remains determined to leave, along with Danny Green's expiring contract, the Raptors can clear up $30 million in salary space and trade players like Lowry and Ibaka to teams with significant cap space but lack reinforcements, thus entering a rebuilding phase ahead of schedule.</p> <p>Similar to the Thunder's trade for Paul George with Victor Oladipo as the main piece last year, although this trade carries a gambling element and involves two years of uncertainty, it is also reasonable.</p> <p>Let's not forget how Kawhi Leonard single-handedly led the Spurs to the Western Conference Finals just a year ago. Some may worry that Leonard will replicate Vince Carter's trade-seeking mode of not giving his best effort, but I believe this is an unnecessary concern.</p> <p>With a wealth of talent available in next year's free agency, if Leonard fails to perform as expected upon his return and his future remains uncertain in terms of his abilities or health, there are frontline players such as Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, and Kemba Walker lining up. The two Los Angeles teams are not the only options for him.</p> <p>As for the speculation of boycotting or not reporting to Toronto, it is purely a fantasy. Despite expressing his reluctance to play in Toronto, under the restrictions of the collective bargaining agreement, if Leonard fails to report to the Raptors within a week, he will be heavily penalized by the team and the league for \"harming the league's development.\" Unless Leonard is prepared to pay a hefty fine or even face the worst-case scenario of being expelled from the league, going against a $8 billion organization is an overstatement.</p> <p>Going back to the trade itself, as the cost of upgrading, the Raptors only gave up Jakob Poeltl, a center who would have been blocked by Jonas Valanciunas in the future for two more years, and a well-protected first-round pick, while strictly refusing to include OG Anunoby. Ujiri did not jeopardize his status as the \"Executive of the Year\" with this trade, as his risk management was precise. They received an instant impact player in return when Tony Parker's return from injury did not meet expectations, promptly promoting Dejounte Murray. When their perimeter shooting struggled this season, they immediately brought back the highly compatible old comrade Marco Belinelli.</p> <p>For Aldridge, who is nearing the end of his career, and Popovich, who could retire at any time, capturing the peak performance of these two core players is the most important task for the Spurs. This trade is no exception! Compared to the likes of Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Dario Saric, Robert Covington, and other highly touted young players, DeMar DeRozan is undoubtedly the most immediately impactful option. Even if the Lakers or 76ers were willing to offer them, it wouldn't be easy for them to reach the heights DeRozan has achieved in the next two years. To some extent, the Raptors were lucky to have DeMar DeRozan on the trade table, and the Spurs were fortunate. The most obvious comparison is the 2011 trade involving Carmelo Anthony, where the Nuggets sent Anthony, who only wanted to go to the Knicks, along with Chauncey Billups, and received Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, and Timofey Mozgov, as well as an unprotected first-round pick. The trade was later mocked as the \"Girls' Generation\" for the Nuggets, who saw a 12-win drop the following year.</p> <p>It wasn't until they acquired Andre Iguodala through a trade that the team rebounded from this low point.</p> <p>The talents of Chandler and Gallinari, which were rumored at the time, were no less than Ingram and Kuzma today. However, the reality proved that basketball is not just about individual skills; it is a league where \"finding one true star is more difficult than having a thousand soldiers.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230908091253513250/","title":"Aggressive Leadership Qualities of Dennis Schroder and Germany's Unfinished Mission in the 2023 World Cup","text":"<p>The preparations for the previous EuroBasket tournament clearly had an impact on the present    Aggressive Leadership Qualities of Dennis Schroder and Germany's Unfinished Mission in the 2023 World Cup</p> <p>The preparations for the previous EuroBasket tournament clearly had an impact on the present. Maxi Kleber refused to represent the national team in order to fully prepare for the NBA season, which led to public criticism from Dennis Schroder.</p> <p>A year later, despite Kleber expressing his desire to participate, the comments made by the \"leader\" of the German national team still hurt him, making him feel unwelcome and reluctant to express his stance to the national team head coach, Gordon Herbert.</p> <p>Please continue reading about Germany in the FIBA World Cup - Previous Tournaments and Best Performances: Germany has participated in the World Cup a total of seven times, but they have only reached the semifinals twice, with their best result being a bronze medal in 2002. In that tournament, Dirk Nowitzki had an outstanding performance (24 points, 11 rebounds), but Germany was still defeated by Argentina in the semifinals. In the battle for third place, Nowitzki once again contributed with 29 points, leading Germany to victory against New Zealand.</p> <p>Four years ago, Germany ambitiously participated in the FIBA World Cup, but they suffered a major setback as they were eliminated in the first round by the Dominican Republic. Please continue reading about their path to qualification: Germany unsurprisingly qualified for the FIBA World Cup this year.</p> <p>They only lost one game in the first phase (5 wins, 1 loss), which was against Estonia in the first round. In the second part of the qualification, they maintained their dominance and finished with a total score of 10-2, securing the first place. Please continue reading about the key players: Perhaps this may sound a bit critical, but the current team's leader seems somewhat misnamed due to his own behavior, as the criteria for becoming a leader is recognition from others rather than one's own opinion. However, Dennis Schroder is undoubtedly the most important player, and without his outstanding performance in the previous World Cup, Germany would not have been able to win the bronze medal.</p> <p>Perhaps on the court, this has never been an issue, but when an important player in the lineup decides not to help the national team due to the leader's public statements, it becomes a big problem.</p> <p>Photo Source: Getty Images Regardless, Schroder is here while Kleber is not, and this is the ideal moment to end this story. In the previous season, Schroder played 66 NBA games for the Los Angeles Lakers, averaging 12.6 points and 4.5 assists per game.</p> <p>In addition, the Wagner brothers have already proven themselves to be reliable. Last year, Schroder and Franz Wagner were bronze medal winners in the EuroCup. Moritz Wagner couldn't participate due to injury, but he had an outstanding performance in the Olympics two years ago. Johannes Thiemann and Johannes Voigtmann, as two experienced European league players, should not be overlooked, and Isaac Bonga can defend all positions from one to five.</p> <p>All three of them can threaten opponents from the outside. If we add Daniel Theis' size and abilities inside, it won't be easy for opponents to gain an advantage against Germany in the paint.</p> <p>Maodo Lo in the backcourt will be the backup plan when Schroder is off the court, as he has proven his scoring ability multiple times.</p> <p>However, the most anticipated C&amp;S player is Andreas Obst. Despite missing most of last season due to injury, Obst is now healthy and ready to provide his strongest weapon to the national team, which is three-point shooting.</p> <p>In this aspect, he is undoubtedly one of the best players in the European league. The head coach, Gordon Herbert, is of Canadian descent and has had a successful coaching career.</p> <p>He has led multiple professional teams, including three terms with Frankfurt. In 2004, he led them to win the German Bundesliga and was awarded the Coach of the Year in 2016 for the same team.</p> <p>Furthermore, Frankfurt also won the FIBA Europe Cup in that season. He has also worked with the Canadian coaching staff and served as an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors, as well as the coach of the Georgian national men's basketball team.</p> <p>He took on the role of head coach for the German national team in 2021. In the first significant game, he led \"Die Mannschaft\" to win a medal at the EuroBasket for the first time in 17 years.</p> <p>Currently, they have a perfect record in the preliminary round and have high expectations of winning the gold medal.

Brown will receive a supermax contract extension worth $304 million over 5 years, setting a new record for the highest salary in NBA history.</p> <p>Last season, Brown averaged a career-high of 26.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game. He played a crucial role in leading the Celtics to the Eastern Conference Finals, and he was selected to the All-Star Game and the All-NBA Second Team. As a result, he qualified for a 5-year maximum contract extension with the Celtics. According to Reuters, Brown was selected by the Celtics as the 3rd overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. He has been an All-Star twice, and his salary for the upcoming season will be $28.5 million. Starting in 2024, his salary will increase each year, averaging $60.8 million per year, doubling his current value.</p> <p>Brown's supermax contract amount even surpasses Nikola Jokic's $276 million contract with the Denver Nuggets, making it the most lucrative contract in NBA history. Jokic has won the regular-season MVP award twice and led the Nuggets to their first NBA championship in the 2022-23 season, earning the NBA Finals MVP with an average of 30.2 points, 14 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in the series. However, Brown's position as the highest-paid player in the NBA may not last long, as his teammate Jayson Tatum will also be eligible to sign a supermax contract extension next year.</p> <p>Why is the Celtics willing to invest heavily in the contract extension? According to ESPN Stats &amp; Information research, Brown and Tatum formed a formidable duo last season, combining for an average of 56.7 points per game. They both scored over 30 points in 10 games, a feat achieved only by the \"O'Bryant Connection\" of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the past 30 years.</p> <p>Additionally, according to Second Spectrum, 54% of Brown's scoring last season came from unassisted shots, and he averaged 1.15 points per possession when driving to the basket, setting a new career-high.</p> <p>[Join Key Commenting Network members] Receive exciting articles directly in your inbox daily, exclusive editor's picks, current affairs, arts and culture newsletters, and more.

Photo/New Taipei Kings Provided</p> <p>New Taipei Kings announced today (9/8) that they have signed power forward Billy Preston, a former five-star high school player from the United States, as their third foreign player in the Jingtai Army. The team hopes that the young and experienced player Billy can contribute to both offense and defense.</p> <p>Billy, from California, is 25 years old and stands at 208cm tall. During his student years, he was selected as a five-star high school player and received recruitment offers from prestigious NCAA schools, including the University of Kansas. His remarkable athleticism is his signature, and he also possesses excellent shooting skills from the perimeter. His exceptional ability to drive often creates scoring opportunities. Although he was not highly regarded in the 2018 NBA Draft, he later represented the Cleveland Cavaliers in the summer league and signed a two-way contract with their G League team, the Cleveland Charge, thus starting his professional career. He then played in various professional leagues in other countries, most recently in the South African Basketball League for the Cape Town Tigers, averaging 16.6 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. Regarding Billy's joining, General Manager Mao Gaen said, \"Billy can be considered a modern-day stretch four, with excellent athleticism and offensive disruption skills, being able to slash and shoot. His agility and height also provide strength to the Jingtai Army's defense. At only 25 years old, he is still a young player with immense potential. We are very excited to see his combination with Mullen and Manny in the upcoming season, and we believe it will bring more flexibility to the Kings in terms of lineup adjustments and help the team achieve better results.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230908103150168976/","title":"Bronny James and Shareef O'Neal both live under the shadow of their famous fathers and face heart problems","text":"<p>Bronny James and Shareef O'Neal both live under the shadow of their famous fathers and face heart problems.</p> <p>Bronny James, the eldest son of LeBron James, collapsed during a training session yesterday and experienced a momentary cardiac arrest. Fortunately, after being promptly rushed to the hospital, he is now out of the intensive care unit and recovering well. However, this incident could potentially undermine all the efforts he has made so far.</p> <p>As the son of LeBron James, Bronny has had to deal with more attention and pressure than your average \"hoops prodigy\". After all, he is not just the son of a basketball player, but the son of a legendary figure with a historical standing in the NBA. Naturally, his basketball talent has been scrutinized more closely. However, compared to his father's high school years, Bronny's dominance on the court is not as remarkable. Although he still possesses decent innate abilities, he has not displayed the same level of domination that his father once did in high school. In fact, during his early high school years, he was even considered a \"chip off the old block\".</p> <p>Despite facing unfavorable criticism from the outside world, Bronny has persevered. Through his own efforts, he has continuously improved his skills and achieved an impressive record of 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists in his senior year. He was also selected for the McDonald's All-American High School Team and received the title of a five-star high school player from some basketball media outlets. Additionally, he secured basketball scholarships from some top-tier NCAA Division I schools.</p> <p>These accomplishments have significantly boosted Bronny's draft prediction, from potentially going undrafted to having a chance at being a first-round or even lottery pick. Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father's reputation. LeBron himself has even mentioned that if Bronny makes it to the NBA, there is a high chance he will join his son's team and play alongside him. This \"son picks father\" move undoubtedly has an impact on Bronny's market value. However, it should not overshadow his own efforts. In the end, he chose the University of Southern California and plans to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. Prior to enrolling in college, he posted on his social media, expressing his determination to prove the doubters wrong.</p> <p>However, the heart problem that has arisen before the start of the new college season has cast a shadow over Bronny's future. Just like in the case of Shareef O'Neal, the son of basketball star Shaquille O'Neal. During his high school years, Shareef indeed achieved some notable performances and was recognized as a four-star high school player by sports media. He was also expected to enter the NBA after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, he was diagnosed with a heart abnormality that posed a high risk to his life and required emergency surgery.</p> <p>The post-surgery recovery and rehabilitation caused Shareef to be away from high-intensity games for a whole 11 months. This was a significant setback for a rising player, as it meant wasting a crucial period of development. His skills and competitiveness might have fallen behind significantly. Moreover, considering Shareef's condition, he was no longer a dominant presence even in the more intense NCAA games. Coaches in college, fearing the risk of a relapse and considering his performance, could not afford to give Shareef too much time. As a result, his college performance declined significantly, and he ultimately faced the fate of going undrafted.</p> <p>\"I always tell Shareef that he will never be the next me.\" \"I want him to play his own game, in his own style.\" \"Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the name O'Neal, but he still needs to create his own path.\" \"Back then, I had the pressure to succeed because I needed to improve my life.\" \"But Shareef didn't have that pressure, so I hope he can find his own goals and strive for them.\" Currently, Shareef is still developing in the G League, waiting for an opportunity. Despite only averaging 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist last season, his recovery from the shadow of his heart condition is a significant progress. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be defined by his father's achievements and reputation, and to bravely pursue his own chosen path. I believe LeBron has a similar perspective on Bronny. Regardless of how it may affect his draft position, it will not diminish LeBron's love for his child. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by any injuries and will showcase his own value in the upcoming season.</p> <p>This article was authorized for publication by the author.

They made a strong comeback and defeated Italy, securing a spot in the World Cup semifinals. Their next opponent will be Germany, who gave the United States a tough time in a friendly match.</p> <p>In the friendly match, the United States was trailing by as much as 16 points, and their defense couldn't contain Germany's offense in the first three quarters. It was only in the final quarter, with increased defensive pressure and the outstanding performance of Anthony Edwards, Austin Reaves, and Tyrese Haliburton on the perimeter, that the United States managed to turn the game around. This victory proved that Germany had a well-established team chemistry before the start of the tournament. Germany is the only undefeated team in this World Cup before the semifinals, and their defense is extremely tight. In this World Cup, all teams have shown high offensive efficiency, but Germany's defense has consistently kept opponents' scores below 80 points, with their highest conceded score being 82 against Australia.</p> <p>Their offensive characteristic is low turnover rate, averaging only 10.2 turnovers per game in the first six matches, which is only slightly higher than Serbia's 9.5 turnovers among the top four teams.</p> <p>The primary ball-handler in the FIBA system is Dennis Schr\u00f6der, who has a different level of efficiency. Besides the previous game against Latvia, he has displayed excellent skills in driving, mid-range shooting, and three-point shooting.</p> <p>The Wagner brothers, Moritz and Franz, who both play for the Orlando Magic, are the main players in the frontcourt, contributing to rebounding, defense, and agility. Especially Franz, with his height advantage, can also handle the ball well. His versatile and steady playing style provides stability to the team. After resting for four games, his return against Latvia proved to be crucial.</p> <p>In addition to the usual high pick-and-roll and screens, Germany's offensive tactics involve active and clear player movements and screens. They are willing to make an extra pass to create better opportunities. Apart from Schr\u00f6der, multiple players can assist and quickly change the direction of the play. The main players all have decent passing abilities, ensuring a balanced offense.</p> <p>Isaac Bonga, with a height of 6-8, is an excellent wing defender. Maodo Lo, a guard from Milan, and Andreas Obst, a guard from Bayern Munich, have a three-point shooting percentage close to 45%, making them the main outside shooters.</p> <p>Johannes Voigtmann, a 6-11 center, is the main center with average athleticism and rebounding skills. He, along with NBA-level center Daniel Theis, acts as the guardians of the paint.</p> <p>Despite having four NBA-experienced players (Wagner brothers, Theis, Schr\u00f6der), Germany does not solely rely on them. In the game against Latvia, Germany used a nine-man rotation, with only Schr\u00f6der playing exactly 30 minutes, and no other player exceeding 25 minutes. The team's energy distribution is well-balanced. Except for guard David Kramer, forward Niels Giffey, and young point guard Justus Hollatz, who have fewer appearances, all other players are ready to contribute. The biggest problem for the United States in this tournament is their defense in the paint and rebounding. Germany's frontline, consisting of players over 6-10 such as Voigtmann and the Wagner brothers, as well as the 6-9 Johannes Thiemann and 6-8 Theis, will pose significant challenges to the United States.</p> <p>Although they don't have exceptional rebounders and their physique is not as robust as traditional Eastern European teams, Theis's toughness, Bonga and the Wagner brothers' agility, Thiemann's activity, and Voigtmann's height will cause difficulties for the United States.</p> <p>Even without a heavyweight tank like Jonas Valanciunas, Germany is likely to try to create trouble for Jaren Jackson Jr., the starting center for the United States, by drawing fouls.</p> <p>Under the leadership of head coach Gordie Herbert, Germany has a well-established defensive rebounding system, with a defensive rebounding rate of 77.3%, ranking first in the tournament. They only allow opponents to grab 8 offensive rebounds per game, which is also among the top rankings. It will be challenging for the United States to gain an advantage in offensive rebounds. Defensive transition is crucial for Germany, especially considering that the United States' athleticism has made them the best in fast break scoring.</p> <p>Usually, the United States has an advantage in terms of physical fitness and depth. Thanks to the schedule, they have had an extra day of rest before the semifinals. Germany will need to maintain a high intensity throughout the game to sustain against them.</p> <p>Franz Wagner mentioned in an interview before the semifinals: \"In a 40-minute game, we need to work together as a team. Individual performances won't make a big difference. We must compete as a whole team, and once we do that, we can defeat any opponent!\" It may sound like a clich\u00e9, but it is the key to winning. Germany doesn't have a superstar like Luka Doncic or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander who can single-handedly carry the team; they rely on teamwork. The game where Lithuania defeated the United States is evidence of this. Lithuania's highest scorer in that game had only 15 points, but they had seven players scoring in double digits, and two players scored 9 points each, with a total of nine three-pointers made by nine different players.</p> <p>Rebounding is also a collective effort, with seven players grabbing offensive rebounds. With their all-around offensive firepower and a determined effort to fight for rebounds, Lithuania secured the victory.</p>"},{"location":"20230909073008677618/","title":"After being expelled from the game in the fourth quarter, Dillon Brooks put on boxing gloves and waved his fists in the player tunnel to greet the return of the coaching staff and teammates","text":"<p>After being expelled from the game in the fourth quarter, Dillon Brooks put on boxing gloves and waved his fists in the player tunnel to greet the return of the coaching staff and teammates.

Unlike the previous five opponents of the US in this World Cup, Lithuania was different in that they only allowed the US to lead for 1 minute and 18 seconds within the first two minutes of the game. Even though the US team made a strong comeback in the second half, Lithuania did not let them take a single step forward. In the end, Lithuania defeated the star-studded US team with a score of 110-104, maintaining their undefeated record in the World Cup so far and handing the US team their first loss in this tournament.</p> <p>Since the 2016 Rio Olympics, the US has failed to maintain a perfect record in their last three international competitions. Please continue reading. Of course, we cannot deny that Lithuania played exceptionally well in this game. Indeed, Lithuania has been the most accurate team from beyond the arc in this World Cup so far. Not only did they make all 9 of their three-point attempts before the start of the game, but they also made a total of 14 three-pointers throughout the game, with contributions from 9 different players, including their main center Jonas Valanciunas. In fact, all 11 players who played in the game attempted shots from beyond the arc. In the fourth quarter, with only 3 minutes and 52 seconds left, Mindaugas Kuzminskas made a difficult three-pointer with Anthony Edwards defending closely, and with 1 minute and 43 seconds remaining, Tomas Dimsa successfully hit another three-pointer to extend the lead to 11 points. These two three-pointers dealt a severe blow to the US. Strictly speaking, the US defense had almost no flaws, yet Lithuania seemed to have luck on their side and ultimately prevented the US from catching up despite their efforts.</p> <p>To only mention three-pointers would be to overlook Lithuania's true strength. Center Jonas Valanciunas has always been challenged by NBA ball-handling guards due to his weak high pick-and-roll defense. He has been tested by guards from the Pelicans and his previous teams time and time again. However, under FIBA rules that allow for zone defense and dominant play by centers in the paint, Valanciunas has become a powerful and versatile force, relying on his strength and low post offensive skills. Coupled with the chemistry and basketball IQ developed through long-term collaboration with the national team, Valanciunas is undoubtedly a star center under FIBA rules. Like the starting center for the US team's previous opponent, Nikola Vucevic from Montenegro, these European star centers have showcased their skills on the FIBA stage. Additionally, Lithuania's shortest player on the team is 6 feet 4 inches tall, and all their guards are strong in matchups. The solid screens and strong defense from the Lithuanian frontcourt players, including Valanciunas, made it difficult for opponents who were not expecting physicality. With a collective agreement to play tough on the court, active movement from shooters, and everyone prepared to compete on both ends of the court, Lithuania remains a formidable power on the world stage, even without NBA star Domantas Sabonis. Please continue reading.</p> <p>This was fully demonstrated in their competition against the US. Of course, the key to Lithuania's significant lead in the first quarter was their incredible three-point shooting, but the biggest factor in their victory throughout the game was their aggressive style of play. They established an early advantage in rebounding and off-ball hustle, as the US starting lineup, apart from the tall Jaren Jackson Jr. and the strong Edwards, was always at a disadvantage in their matchups against Lithuania. Even though the second unit of the US had Tyrese Haliburton and Brandon Ingram, who excel in their respective positions, Lithuania always found ways to exploit Austin Reaves with team coverage. Lithuania outrebounded the US 43 to 27, and their second unit had a commanding lead of 17 to 2 in scoring. Just before the end of the third quarter, Kuzminskas grabbed an offensive rebound and scored, allowing Lithuania to maintain a safe distance from the US's second unit going into the fourth quarter. Thankfully, Lithuania had accumulated enough of an advantage in the first three quarters to hold onto the lead. Otherwise, if Lithuania had only secured one more offensive rebound and allowed the US to score, the US's comeback attempt could have been successful. As for the US, in the group stage, they replaced Ingram with Josh Hart in the starting lineup to address Ingram's slump. This meant that the starting lineup consisted of Hart, Mikal Bridges, and Jalen Brunson, the Villanova champions' connection. However, this starting lineup was essentially a \"one big, four small\" lineup without any ambiguity. This also indicates that apart from Edwards, the only player in the starting lineup with attacking abilities, Bridges and Hart are considered \"functional wing players\" who have received some praise in recent years, or Bridges, after his offensive breakout since joining the Nets, appears to be \"more than just a functional player.\" However, fundamentally speaking, they are not like Valanciunas, who can dismantle opponents' defenses with brute force in the low post, or like Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, or at least Dwyane Wade, who can score in high-level games as superstars. Indeed, from the selection of this US starting lineup, or the overall composition of the team, we can see that the US has many outstanding functional players. However, in this game against Lithuania, the shortcomings of this lineup were evident.</p>"},{"location":"20230909073203716997/","title":"Aggressive Leadership and Germany's Unfinished Business in the 2023 World Cup","text":"<p>The preparations for the previous EuroBasket tournament have clearly had an impact on the present    Aggressive Leadership and Germany's Unfinished Business in the 2023 World Cup</p> <p>The preparations for the previous EuroBasket tournament have clearly had an impact on the present. Maxi Kleber, wanting to fully prepare for the NBA season, declined to represent the national team, which led to Dennis Schroder publicly criticizing him.</p> <p>A year later, despite Kleber expressing his desire to participate, the comments made by the German national team's \"leader\" still hurt him, making him feel unwelcome and reluctant to approach national team head coach Gordon Herbert.</p> <p>Please continue reading about Germany in the FIBA World Cup \u2013 Previous Achievements and Best Results.

In the second part of the qualification, they continued their dominance, finishing with a total score of 10-2, securing the top spot.</p> <p>Key Players: Perhaps this may sound critical, but the team's current leader seems to be a bit misnamed due to his own behavior. After all, the condition for becoming a leader is recognition from others, not just one's own opinion. Of course, Dennis Schroder is undoubtedly the most important player. Without his excellent performance in the previous World Cup, Germany would not have won the bronze medal.</p> <p>Perhaps on the court, it has never been an issue. But when an important player in the lineup decides not to help the national team due to the \"leader's\" public statements, it becomes a significant problem.

The newly appointed GM, Zhang Shuren, recently announced the arrival of Serbian coach Milan Mitrovic, hoping to bring his past experiences and lead a transformation both internally and externally for the team.</p> <p>What kind of help or changes can we expect from the current roster of the City Lions? Let's explore further. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Apart from the ups and downs in player contracts, the City Lions have undergone some changes. Firstly, their title sponsor partnership has ended, and the team will return to being called the \"Hsinchu City Lions\" as they start afresh. The position of GM, which had been vacant for a long time, has now been taken over by Zhang Shuren, the former GM of the New Taipei CTBC Bank, and the Secretary-General of the T1 League. He hopes to bring about changes from within and elevate the team towards their first championship in history. Zhang Shuren holds a Master's degree in Business Administration from the Johns Hopkins University in the United States. He has held various positions in the media and team management, showing his involvement in both baseball and basketball. He has also served as a PR and spokesperson for international competitions, demonstrating his high level of familiarity with the industry. As the GM who built the inaugural team for the CTBC Bank, he successfully laid the foundation for a championship-winning team and created an award-winning home court. Later, he was recruited into the league headquarters, where his excellent skills and thinking were evident in theme design and organizing All-Star games. It is fair to say that he is one of the top management figures in the industry. [Interview] Zhang Shuren, the newly appointed General Manager of the Hsinchu City Lions: \"Taking Hsinchu's local support and going out to communicate with the world.\" The above is an excerpt from a previous interview with Zhang Shuren, the author of the article, and if you are interested in understanding his profound thoughts and expectations for the future of the City Lions, I recommend taking the time to read it.</p> <p>Throughout the years of transitioning between teams and positions, it is clear that Zhang Shuren has always talked about completing phase-based missions. This indicates the demands and execution power he sets for himself in different positions. Facing the changing trend of basketball development in Asia, it is the main reason that led him to take on the role of GM once again. He has a strong desire to promote regional basketball development and exchange between professional teams from different countries, making the team an international professional basketball club. Recent waves of news have shown that their plans are already in motion and are making more people see their efforts.</p> <p>Please continue reading.</p> <p>In July of this year, the Hsinchu City Lions formed a sister team partnership with the Japanese B.LEAGUE team Aomori Wat's, and the two teams plan to visit each other's home court for friendly games during the new season. They have also sent their long-trained youth team to visit the home court of the Ryukyu Golden Kings in Okinawa for venue tours and friendly matches, allowing the team to learn and grow both on and off the court.</p> <p>Recently, they went to Xiamen to participate in the \"Xiamen Professional Basketball Invitational\" and at the end of the month, they will travel to Singapore to participate in the FIBA Intercontinental Cup exhibition games. The team is united from top to bottom, and with Zhang Shuren taking over, the progress has become faster and more solid. Regarding the team roster, Zhang Shuren believes that \"in the past two years, I have come to realize the importance of team basketball. This offseason, our focus is on how to develop local players and combine them with foreign players' offensive and defensive characteristics.\"</p> <p>With the foreign players' situations yet to be finalized, there is still a lot of room for exploration and maneuvering. Fans can look forward to finding players suitable for the team's development.</p> <p>When it comes to local operations, Zhang Shuren mentioned, \"In the past three years, the City Lions and the Purple Lions have fully embodied the concept that 'this city needs a team.' I hope that in the next season, besides being the team with the highest cohesion in Taiwan, we can bring glory back to this city.\" It seems they are ready for a complete transformation. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Assistant coach with European style joins the coaching staff, can the Lions spark a team revolution? One of Zhang Shuren's first moves after taking office was to recruit Serbian coach Milan Mitrovic into the coaching staff, hoping to establish the desired team style as the first step. During the announcement, it was mentioned, \"European players have a great understanding of basketball and the ability to read the game situation. By recruiting a Serbian assistant coach, we hope to incorporate elements of European basketball style and help the City Lions embody the concept of team basketball.\" This gives a sense of whether everything will follow a successful model to build a new team.</p> <p>At 42 years old, Mitrovic has extensive coaching experience, particularly in player development. He has previously served as an assistant coach in various European professional basketball leagues, including Serbia, Romania, and Poland. From 2014 to 2021, he was an assistant coach for the CSM Oradea team in the Romanian Basketball League, which is a regular participant in the playoffs. He has helped the team win championships three times in this role and has even made appearances in the national team. After a brief stint in the Polish league two years ago, he returned to Romania last year as the head coach of FC Arges Pitesti. This is his first time coaching in Asia. When interviewed, Mitrovic stated, \"I will pay special attention to defensive details in the future. I believe that the finesse of defense will be the key to future victories. In the near future, I will analyze each player's offensive and defensive strengths through video analysis. I will assist Head Coach Guanlun during team training and help players improve their individual skills.\" This points out the Lions' major flaw from last year, with an average of 99.6 points conceded per game, ranking last in the league with a significant gap. Strengthening defense through discipline and systematic team cohesion will be the key to the team's transformation.</p>"},{"location":"20230909073825880708/","title":"Is gender pay equality in sports reasonable before the Women's World Cup in New Zealand?","text":"<p>According to The Washington Post, the female members of the Western Springs Association Football Club in New Zealand have recently reached an agreement with the management to raise their salaries and resources to be equal to male players   Is gender pay equality in sports reasonable before the Women's World Cup in New Zealand?</p> <p>According to The Washington Post, the female members of the Western Springs Association Football Club in New Zealand have recently reached an agreement with the management to raise their salaries and resources to be equal to male players. The ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup, jointly hosted by New Zealand and Australia, is also set to open in New Zealand on July 20.</p> <p>Pip Meo, a former member of the New Zealand national team and a driving force behind the agreement, pointed out that the fight for equal pay is not just about salaries but about the value of women's sports and sending a positive message to generations of girls wearing soccer shoes. Meo added, \"We can't celebrate yet because we still have to see how this deal turns out, and we've only gotten what we should have gotten.\" The Washington Post reported that although New Zealand's global image is constantly improving, its soccer industry has long faced issues of unequal pay and resource allocation between genders.</p> <p>Most soccer clubs in New Zealand are amateur clubs run by volunteers, and the maximum salary a player can receive is regulated by the national soccer federation at around $94 per week. However, whether clubs will distribute salaries equally has not received much attention from the government.</p> <p>In New Zealand's soccer community, women receive lower salaries, less field access, fewer resources, training opportunities, and coaching staff compared to men. Usually, women's teams only have one coach, while men's teams have several.</p> <p>In 2022, members of the Manukau United soccer team in New Zealand initiated a campaign for gender pay and resource equality but ended in failure.</p> <p>Maia Jackman, a team member, stated, \"Many female players from various teams will stand up for themselves, but they will be discouraged and eventually give up. However, the people at Western Springs are different; they have consistently stood by their beliefs without backing down.\"</p> <p>Meo and Jackman joined the Western Springs Association, where most of the board members are men, in 2023, and once again attempted to achieve gender equality in soccer. After two months of struggle, Meo and Jackman, along with two pro bono lawyers, reached an agreement with the club's management through a 12-hour marathon-style mediation session and the threat of a strike, achieving gender equality. The club also issued a statement apologizing for its past shortcomings. Regarding the successful negotiation, Meo responded that the new agreement has not officially been implemented yet, so they can't be too happy too soon. Jackman stated, \"Ultimately, we just want to play without restrictions or concerns.\"</p> <p>Jackman mentioned that her focus will now be on the World Cup, hoping to showcase the charm of women's soccer through this event.</p> <p>According to CBS and Lexology reports, gender pay inequality exists in many sports worldwide. For example, in basketball, the average annual income of male NBA players is $5.3 million, with star players earning even more. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant had annual salaries of $45.7 million and $42 million, respectively, last year.</p> <p>In contrast, the average annual income of female WNBA players is only $130,000, with the highest-earning player in the league making only $230,000.</p> <p>However, the reports also point out that the main reason for the wage gap between men and women in sports is that women's sports are not as popular as men's sports and generate less revenue and ticket sales, naturally resulting in lower salaries. NBA's revenue for the previous season was around $10 billion, while WNBA's revenue was only $60 million.</p> <p>However, focusing on American football, the US women's national team has generated more revenue and attracted more viewers than the men's team since 2019, yet their income and winning bonuses were still lower than those of male players until last year. Lexology reports that the most effective way to promote gender equality in sports is to promote women's sports more.</p> <p>Encouraging advertising and media coverage of female athletes and encouraging businesses to invest more in women's sports and athletes can bring more attention and revenue, contributing to equal pay between men and women.</p>"},{"location":"20230909073905366098/","title":"NBADannyGreen returns to the 76ers with a one-year contract","text":"<p>According to reports from ESPN, agent Sam Permut of RocNationSports revealed that free agent Danny Green has reached a one-year contract agreement with the Philadelphia 76ers    NBADannyGreen returns to the 76ers with a one-year contract </p> <p>According to reports from ESPN, agent Sam Permut of RocNationSports revealed that free agent Danny Green has reached a one-year contract agreement with the Philadelphia 76ers.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is comparable to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Don\u010di\u0107, the rising stars in international competition. Let's discuss and share various views on the game. The score of the quarterfinals of the 2023 FIBA World Cup between Canada and Slovenia was 100:89. Canada, which has made remarkable progress in the world basketball arena in recent years, won the game and made it to the top four for the first time in their history, crushing Slovenia's dream of reaching the top four.</p> <p>The biggest pre-game focus and post-game topic undoubtedly revolved around the world's number one star, Luka Don\u010di\u0107. Before the game, there was speculation about whether Don\u010di\u0107, who was expected to be a candidate for NBA MVP in the new season, could dominate and lead a strong Slovenian team to achieve their best international performance. The question was whether they could advance towards the championship and achieve personal milestones in the highly competitive World Cup. However, the post-game focus shifted to Don\u010di\u0107 being ejected from the crucial battle due to two technical fouls.</p> <p>Don\u010di\u0107 revealed after the game that a referee had told the Slovenian players that he would not give him the calls he wanted because of his disrespect towards the referees. This was evident in most situations during the game, as Don\u010di\u0107 created collisions with the ball, but the referees did not blow the whistle. This was followed by Don\u010di\u0107's various expressions of dissatisfaction towards the referees, but his efforts to earn the calls were in vain.</p> <p>To be honest, in this quarterfinals game, it was clear that Canada had a slight advantage in terms of the calls. Don\u010di\u0107 may have had reasons to complain, but he paid the price by receiving technical fouls for his complaints. Although the team fought hard and the final point difference was only four points when Don\u010di\u0107 was ejected, his absence in the second half of the game hindered Slovenia's comeback.</p> <p>Don\u010di\u0107 could be considered a double loser, but Canada's star player, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, was a double winner. He had an outstanding individual performance, and Canada achieved victory and advanced, creating a new milestone in their team's history. The meeting between the two players in this international competition, with one rising and the other falling, was something rarely anticipated.</p> <p>Regarding Don\u010di\u0107, he first came into the spotlight during the 2017 EuroBasket when Slovenia unexpectedly won the championship. At that time, the team's point guard, Goran Dragi\u0107, won the tournament MVP, but the 18-year-old Don\u010di\u0107 had already shown his ability to take on the responsibility of a key player. People noticed that, similar to Ricky Rubio from Spain in the past, a young basketball prodigy who attracted everyone's attention had emerged from Europe. From that EuroBasket tournament onwards, Don\u010di\u0107, as a basketball prodigy, quickly rose to prominence on the world stage. He received significant attention during the 2018 NBA Draft and could have challenged for the top pick if it weren't for Deandre Ayton's perfect fit for the Phoenix Suns, regardless of position or background. Don\u010di\u0107 ultimately became the third pick in the draft and joined the Dallas Mavericks through a trade. Since then, no one has been able to stop Don\u010di\u0107 from shining on various basketball courts. In his rookie year in the NBA, he averaged 21.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 6.0 assists, and his numbers have only improved throughout his five-year career. This season, he has reached the level of \"30-8-8,\" which is truly remarkable. In terms of the world stage, Don\u010di\u0107 has undoubtedly inherited the baton from Dragi\u0107 and has become the absolute core of Slovenia's self-built system. In this year's World Cup, with the absence of Nikola Joki\u0107 from Serbia, Gianis Antetokounmpo from Greece, and other top American players, Don\u010di\u0107 posted impressive stats of 26.3 points (the highest in the tournament), 6.8 rebounds, and 6.5 assists, living up to his reputation as the top star of the tournament.</p> <p>Speaking of his performance, there is no doubt about Don\u010di\u0107's skills and the \"wunderkind\" label that has been attached to him since his early years. The problem lies in the increasing number of instances where Don\u010di\u0107 has been seen arguing with referees, possibly due to tasting success in the NBA. In the past three seasons, Don\u010di\u0107 has consistently ranked in the top three in technical fouls in the league, exceeding the threshold of 16 technical fouls that would result in a suspension. In this World Cup quarterfinals game, he was ejected due to two technical fouls. Not only did Don\u010di\u0107 express his dissatisfaction with gestures, but he even made a money-counting gesture towards the referees, implying that they were being bribed and unfair. Although the referees' officiating may not have been ideal, Don\u010di\u0107's actions were unacceptable and could be considered a stain on his reputation.</p> <p>Of course, objectively speaking, Slovenia may not have been the most favored team to win the championship. The only reason they received some expectations was because of Don\u010di\u0107. Having such a superstar raises hopes for him to create miracles. However, miracles did not happen this time, and Slovenia failed to make it to the top four. Looking at the results, it may not necessarily be considered a disappointment, but the way Don\u010di\u0107 swallowed defeat along with his ejection from the game is reminiscent of the 2021 NBA playoffs, where MVP Joki\u0107 was ejected from a game and watched his team get swept while trailing 0-3.</p>"},{"location":"20230909091150387186/","title":"Reunion with the Philippines: A Memorable Moment from the 2023 World Cup","text":"<p>38 years ago, Arthur 'Chip' Engelland played his last official game in the Philippines    Reunion with the Philippines: A Memorable Moment from the 2023 World Cup</p> <p>38 years ago, Arthur 'Chip' Engelland played his last official game in the Philippines. Since then, he had only returned to the country once, but in another sense, he had never left. Engelland is currently the shooting coach for the USA team in the World Cup, and it comes as no surprise that he is recognized by fans on the sidelines. Even in the United States, many Filipino-Americans would approach him on the streets for photos. Engelland remarked, \"If I can be recognized in the US, it's only natural that more people in the Philippines would know me.\"</p> <p>Engelland continued, \"It's been almost 40 years since I last played on the court, yet to be recognized in the US is truly amazing. The Filipino fans are incredible. I've met some passionate fans in Las Vegas, and we sat down to chat about the PBA (Philippine Basketball Association) and our beloved country.\"</p> <p>Please continue reading to find out how Engelland has left an indelible mark in the Philippine basketball scene. Engelland is arguably the best pure shooter in PBA history. After graduating from Duke University, he came to the Philippines to play. Engelland participated in 76 games across three PBA cups, averaging 27.5 points per game, with a record of 60 points in a single game. His precise shooting earned him the nickname \"Machine Gun\" among Filipino fans. Engelland was also a member of the famous Northern Consolidated Corporation (NCC) in the 1980s. NCC was the team designated by then-Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to represent the country in international tournaments.</p> <p>The team trained together for several months, essentially functioning as a club team not affiliated with any league. Engelland was one of four naturalized players on the team. In 1982, they helped the Philippines secure fourth place in the Asian Games held in India. In 1985, NCC won the Asian Championship in Kuala Lumpur, earning them a spot in the 1986 FIBA World Championship in Spain.</p> <p>Please continue reading to learn about their triumph in the 1985 William Jones Cup, where Engelland scored 43 points in a game against the representative team from Purdue University in the United States. Engelland said, \"Without Jeff Moore and Dennis Still, we would never have won the Jones Cup. We were a versatile and cohesive team, and our bond still remains strong.\" These achievements made the Philippines proud and garnered attention from basketball enthusiasts. (Note: Please remove the mention of photos as per the request.)</p> <p>After the conclusion of NCC's program in 1986, Engelland returned to the United States. He played in minor leagues for a few seasons before transitioning into coaching. Engelland organized camps and became a personal training consultant for players. He earned the nickname \"Shot Doctor\" and counted current USA team head coach Steve Kerr and general manager Grant Hill among his clients.</p> <p>In the 1999-2000 season, Engelland became the shooting coach assistant for the Detroit Pistons. Three years later, he moved on to become the Director of Player Development for the Denver Nuggets. Engelland spent 17 years as an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs, helping them win two NBA championships. Players like Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, and Dejounte Murray achieved breakthroughs under his guidance, and he is widely regarded as the top assistant coach in the NBA.</p> <p>Kerr had always wanted to recruit Engelland as a shooting coach for the Golden State Warriors, but their collaboration eventually happened within the national team setup.</p> <p>Currently, Engelland is a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder coaching staff. He is preparing to nurture a group of talented young players such as Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams, including key players from the Canadian and Australian teams, namely Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey, who the Thunder are actively developing. Giddey speaks highly of Engelland's guidance, saying, \"Since Engelland joined, I've been practicing shooting with him almost every day, 2 to 3 times a day. I spend a lot of time receiving his instructions. He's truly a genius.\"</p> <p>Engelland also mentioned his two proteges, saying, \"With SGA and Josh, Canada and Australia will definitely pose a significant challenge for us to win the championship. They have already proven themselves in the NBA.\"</p> <p>Please continue reading to find out that Engelland's last visit to the Philippines was 17 years ago, but he only stayed for a few days. After so many years, he is now attempting to rediscover the metropolitan city that he once called home. Engelland shared, \"There are many places I no longer recognize. I can still identify some people and things, and there are some streets and landmarks that I still remember. But there are too many new buildings, so I have to find new landmarks to navigate around. Nevertheless, I'm really enjoying my stay this time.\" Engelland also mentioned that due to a busy schedule, his primary focus is helping the USA team win the championship, so he hasn't had many opportunities to watch the current Philippine national team games. He said, \"I spend a lot of time studying our opponents and helping the USA team players, but I know that the Philippines has many competitive games.\"</p> <p>(Note: Please remove the mention of photos as per the request.)</p>"},{"location":"20230909091243121393/","title":"Germany staged a remarkable comeback in the first half and secured an impressive 29-point victory over Slovenia to remain undefeated in the FIBA World Cup","text":"<p>Germany staged a remarkable comeback in the first half and secured an impressive 29-point victory over Slovenia to remain undefeated in the FIBA World Cup.

His return from injury against Latvia after a four-game absence proved to be a significant boost.</p> <p>In addition to the typical high pick-and-roll and Spain's screen-and-roll tactics, Germany's offensive system emphasizes player movement and clear off-ball screens to create better opportunities. Apart from Schr\u00f6der, multiple players can contribute to playmaking and quick ball movement, resulting in a well-balanced distribution of scoring among the main players.</p> <p>Isaac Bonga, standing at 6'8\", is an excellent perimeter defender, while Milan guard Maodo Lo and Bayern Munich guard Andreas Obst boast a three-point shooting percentage close to 45%, providing significant outside scoring.</p> <p>Johannes Voigtmann, a 6'11\" center, is the main force in the middle, possessing shooting range despite average athleticism and rebounding. He, along with NBA caliber center Daniel Theis, forms a formidable defensive presence in the paint.</p> <p>Although Germany has four players with NBA experience (the Wagner brothers, Theis, and Schr\u00f6der), they do not solely rely on them. In the game against Latvia, Germany utilized a nine-man rotation, with only Schr\u00f6der playing exactly 30 minutes. Other players did not exceed 25 minutes, demonstrating ideal energy management. Apart from guards David Kramer, forward Niels Giffey, and emerging point guard Justus Hollatz, who have seen less playing time, the rest of the team is capable and ready to contribute.</p> <p>The United States' biggest challenge in this tournament has been their interior defense and rebounding. Germany's frontline consists of Voigtmann, the Wagner brothers, Johannes Thiemann at 6'9\", and Isaac Bonga, who all possess considerable height. While not having exceptional rebounding specialists or the traditionally robust physique of Eastern European teams, the physicality of Theis, the agility of Bonga and the Wagner brothers, and the height of Voigtmann can pose significant challenges for the United States. Even without a heavyweight tank like Jonas Valanciunas, Germany will surely attempt to create problems for Jaren Jackson Jr. with foul trouble, the starting center for the United States (referred to as JJJ in the following text). Under the leadership of head coach Gordie Herbert, Germany has a well-established defensive and rebounding system, boasting a defensive rebounding rate of 77.3%, the highest in the tournament. They have limited opponents to only 8 offensive rebounds per game, ranking second in the tournament, making it difficult for the United States to have an advantage in offensive rebounding.</p> <p>For Germany, the defense in transition after attacking is crucial since the athleticism of the United States makes them the best fast-break team in the world. Counteracting the United States' strength, Germany must maintain a high level of intensity throughout the game, which is made more challenging by the extra day of rest the United States had due to their schedule. Franz Wagner emphasized the importance of team effort in an interview before the semifinals, stating that individual standout performances alone would not be enough. He mentioned that the whole team must compete actively together, and once achieved, they can defeat any opponent. While it may sound clich\u00e9, this is the key to winning. Germany does not have a superstar like Luka Doncic or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander who can single-handedly carry the team; therefore, they heavily rely on teamwork.</p> <p>The evidence of Lithuania's victory over the United States is also noteworthy. No player on the Lithuanian team scored more than 15 points, but seven players reached double-digit scoring, and two others contributed 9 points, with a total of nine players making three-pointers. Rebounding was also a collective effort, with seven players grabbing offensive rebounds. By firing on all cylinders and exerting maximum effort, Lithuania secured the final victory, capitalizing on their physical advantages.</p>"},{"location":"20230910091357386000/","title":"Glory Review of the 2023 Basketball Hall of Fame","text":"<p>Without a doubt, the Basketball Hall of Fame pays tribute to the most outstanding individuals in the industry every summer    Glory Review of the 2023 Basketball Hall of Fame</p> <p>Without a doubt, the Basketball Hall of Fame pays tribute to the most outstanding individuals in the industry every summer. However, compared to any previous list of Hall of Fame inductees, this year's list beautifully embodies the ever-changing nature of the sport.</p> <p>We witnessed the entry of the NBA's winningest coach into the highest hall of basketball. We also saw one of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s enter the Hall of Fame, who, in her first year as a head coach, won the WNBA championship, following a brilliant career as a WNBA player.</p> <p>Please continue reading considering that all five previous regular-season MVP awards were won by foreign players, so it is understandable that three international stars have been included in the list.</p> <p>Finally, one of the superstars who initiated the trend of super teams will also add a new record to his personal achievements.</p> <p>Gregg Popovich can be said to be the person in NBA history who knows how to win games better than anyone else. He has won five championship rings, although he has never won consecutive championships. The beauty of his coaching career lies in the fact that the Spurs never relied solely on a championship roster to build a dynasty. Instead, through personnel or stylistic changes, along with subtle adjustments, he cultivated a team of excellent players.</p> <p>In fact, Popovich was once questioned early in his career. He called Avery Johnson and David Robinson to his home and told them that if the underperforming team lost to the Rockets the next day, he believed he might be fired.</p> <p>This ignited the team's passion, as they went on to win 31 of their last 36 regular-season games and embarked on a journey of greatness.</p> <p>Please continue reading that led by former MVPs Tim Duncan and Robinson, the Spurs won the championship in 1999 and again in 2003.</p> <p>However, in 2005 and 2007, after Tony Parker and Manu Gin\u00f3bili became the offensive core, the composition of the lineup underwent fundamental changes. Nevertheless, under Popovich's leadership, the Spurs won championships in those seasons. Just when the GDP combination was criticized due to their age, a miracle happened in 2014.</p> <p>After the Spurs' appearance in the 2013 NBA Finals, they welcomed a new lineup. With the aging GDP as the core and the addition of superstar Kawhi Leonard, they played an unselfish style of basketball, prioritizing ball movement over individual stardom.</p> <p>This change led them to defeat the star-studded Heat in five games and win their fifth championship on the biggest stage of the sport.</p> <p>(Not to be overlooked, under Popovich's guidance, the Spurs made the playoffs for 22 consecutive years, setting an NBA record.)</p> <p>At the age of 74, Popovich is still the head coach of the Spurs. In a way, he has come full circle in his professional career in San Antonio, with a promising young star on the team and the hope of contending for another championship. Becky Hammon, please continue reading.</p> <p>Hammon's path to fame was not easy, even as a scorer. Her skills and talent as a precise shooter were somewhat overlooked, and her journey in high school was not ideal. She then went on to Colorado State University and was not selected in the professional league draft.</p> <p>However, she quickly made the managers who ignored her look foolish with her dominant performances. She showcased not only the skills of a sharpshooter but also the exceptional vision and gritty playing style of a point guard.</p> <p>She began her professional career with the New York Liberty, where she became a fan favorite before being traded to the San Antonio Silver Stars.</p> <p>In the 2007, 2008, and 2009 seasons, she averaged 18.8, 17.6, and 19.5 points, respectively. (In 2008, Hammon led the Silver Stars to the WNBA Finals and became the seventh player in WNBA history to reach the 5,000-point milestone.)</p> <p>Hammon suffered an ACL tear in 2013, which ended her playing career. During her recovery, Popovich allowed her to participate in Spurs practices and coaching meetings, and then invited her to join the team in 2014, becoming the first full-time female assistant coach in league history. Since leaving that position at the end of 2021, Hammon became the first female coach in WNBA history to win a championship in her first season and may begin her own illustrious coaching career with the Las Vegas Aces.</p> <p>When Dwyane Wade led the Miami Heat to their first championship in 2006, this Marquette University player was considered the NBA's premier player for a period of time. Wade may not have been the most outstanding outside shooter, but whenever he took off from mid-range, he was a moving threat. Besides his long-range shooting, he excelled in other areas.</p> <p>Wade was an exceptional basketball player and a suffocating defender. Despite standing only 6 feet 4 inches tall, he holds the NBA record for the most blocks by a guard. True to his nickname \"Flash,\" he was an agile slasher and would cut to the basket when defenders least expected it.</p>"},{"location":"20230910091446448959/","title":"Who is the Mizuno Wave Rider 27 or 26 Shoes that Dingzi shared?","text":"<p>When someone asks, \"I want to start running, does Mizuno have any recommended shoe models?

Which Mizuno shoes are more suitable?\" When I started seriously following a training schedule, are there any recommended Mizuno running shoes for daily training? The answer to all these questions is likely to be Mizuno Wave Rider without a doubt (laughs~). As the most classic (evergreen) running shoe from Mizuno, the Wave Rider series has always maintained a stable functionality, designed to provide shoes for beginner runners or daily training. It has a certain level of performance in cushioning, stability, durability, and comfort. Perhaps in various aspects such as weight and flexibility, it may not have the flagship specifications, but it is definitely a series of shoes that you don't have to worry about. Don't worry about the kind of shoes that you are used to wearing. What if they are discontinued? The Wave Rider series is the kind of series that you can continue to wear. If your Wave Rider 25 is worn out and you can't buy it anymore, you can seamlessly transition to the 26th generation, or the 27th generation is also good. You can continue to adapt without pain and become one of the biggest features of the Wave Rider series.

However, based on their performance in the Jones Cup, it seems that they have yet to find suitable candidates to replace the starting lineup. With the confirmation that Chen Yingjun will not be able to play in the Asian Games, Zeng Wendong has been added to the roster. The question remains whether Li Dewei, who has shown good organization skills, and Zeng Xiangjun, who is more agile in offense and defense, will lose the opportunity to take charge in the frontcourt. Let's analyze this statement further. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Looking at the evolution of the tactics in the Jones Cup, Li Dewei and Zeng Xiangjun have intersecting roles. In addition to naturalized player Andray Blatche becoming a key player in the frontcourt, there are also six local players on the team. Li Dewei, Zeng Xiangjun, and Chen Guanquan are the main substitutes, while Zhou Boxun, Zeng Wendong, and Wang Haoji serve as backup options, strengthening the team's offense and defense in the paint.</p> <p>However, despite averaging 38 rebounds per game, with Blatche contributing 10.5 rebounds, the three main local players only average 7.9 rebounds, which is not a significant advantage over their opponents. The team also faces the problem of lacking guards, which has affected their ball organization and the selection of frontcourt players. Li Dewei has been a regular starter in the previous games, providing ball handling skills in the frontcourt to relieve the pressure on Lin Tingqian, who is filling in as the point guard. Li Dewei often operates from the high post or top of the key, using hand-offs and screens, and focusing on the \"Chicago Action\" tactics, showcasing his strengths among the frontcourt players.</p> <p>Looking at the statistics, Li Dewei has performed well in terms of assists and rebounds against the Philippines and Japan. Although he lacks agility, his height and physicality make him a solid defensive presence in the paint, contributing 1.4 blocks per game. However, he has been limited to a maximum of 5 points in a single game, which shows that he has been restricted in his role as the team's tactics have changed. This led to him being placed on the bench. The key turning point was the game against Qatar, where Lin Tingqian and Blatche's pick-and-roll combination allowed Coach Sonny Sablan to find a new approach, changing the emphasis on high post ball handling and attempting to involve the power forward in the offense.</p> <p>Although Li Dewei can shoot from outside, his shooting speed is not fast enough. He can play low-post offense, but lacks the skills and agility to outmaneuver opponents. His efficiency in following up on rebounds is not good, and his offensive contributions come mainly from second-chance points and offensive rebounds. His recent negative plus-minus values indicate a decline in his effectiveness on the court, and his role has become somewhat unclear.</p> <p>Now let's talk about a small incident in the Jones Cup. Zeng Xiangjun expressed his opinion on social media, indicating that he felt he had limited playing time. Although he didn't have many opportunities in the previous games, his statistics were not bad, and he efficiently completed his tasks. His performance was consistent with the team's overall performance. As a result, he became the preferred option in the lineup as Coach Lin Tingqian focused more on attacking from the power forward position. Zeng Xiangjun's quick shooting, agility, and impact made him an important part of the team. He made two three-pointers against the United Arab Emirates and the United States, and scored in double digits in the last four games. He had a plus-minus value of 33 against South Korea, which expanded the team's offensive options and increased their fast break opportunities.</p> <p>Zeng Xiangjun's advantage in the local frontcourt lies in his agility. With a height of 205cm and a weight of 95kg, he has a well-proportioned physique that allows him to play as a stretch big in a 5-out system or as part of a small-ball lineup. He has good awareness in following up on plays and has offensive skills from mid-range, making him more in line with the modern basketball trend in terms of offense and defense. Unless there are major changes in the coaching staff in the short term, Zeng Xiangjun will definitely be the preferred choice in the lineup.</p> <p>However, his average of 0.9 assists and 0.7 blocks per game shows that he is primarily focused on finishing plays on offense. Despite his height, he needs to improve his court vision and passing skills. He still needs to develop his awareness in pick-and-roll situations to give the coach more options.</p> <p>From the above analysis, it is clear that Zeng Xiangjun and Li Dewei, the main local frontcourt players, have different playing styles. Zeng Xiangjun excels in defense and playmaking, while Li Dewei is skilled in offense and speed. They both bring different offensive and defensive styles to the Chinese team. Their playing time in the Jones Cup alternated, not based on their performance, but rather on the team's tactics and ball-dominant approach. However, it is certain that they will be the main forces in the Asian Games, along with the naturalized players.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, with the presence of the top three CBA players and quality local point guards in the lineup, it would be clear who should start and who should be the backups. However, injuries have caused changes in the lineup, making this question unpredictable. With Chen Yingjun's withdrawal from the Asian Games and Wu Yongsheng being added as a replacement, it is clear that there is a void in the point guard position. Lin Tingqian still has to fill in as the starting point guard, and Zeng Wendong's inclusion in the roster leaves no doubt about the choice of local frontcourt players. It is almost certain that apart from Zeng Xiangjun, the other frontcourt players will have limited playing time. Even though Zeng Wendong is already 39 years old, his efficient playing style, basketball IQ, and playmaking skills are qualities that the team needs to win games. Unless other players in different positions are performing exceptionally well, Zeng Wendong will likely get around 20 minutes of playing time. As for this roster change, it is disappointing for the writer, as it sacrifices the future for the sake of pursuing medals.</p>"},{"location":"20230911091331159422/","title":"Chat after the United States lost to Lithuania","text":"<p>The United States team lost the game   Chat after the United States lost to Lithuania</p> <p>The United States team lost the game... but is it really that serious? First of all, in terms of substance, the significance of this defeat is not very important. Please continue reading because the United States does not value the World Cup (including the predecessor, the FIBA World Championship) as much as the Olympics, so naturally, the results are not as good as the Olympics. Here are the results of the United States team (don't call it the Dream Team, it's unfair to the players) after NBA players were allowed to participate:</p> <p>Olympics: 92\ud83e\udd47, 96\ud83e\udd47, 00\ud83e\udd47, 04\ud83e\udd49, 08\ud83e\udd47, 12\ud83e\udd47, 16\ud83e\udd47, 20\ud83e\udd47 (a total of 7 gold and 1 bronze, experiencing 3 losses in 2004 and 1 loss in 2020).</p> <p>World Cup (including the predecessor, the FIBA World Championship): 94\ud83e\udd47, 98\ud83e\udd49, 02\ufe0f\u20e3, 06\ud83e\udd49, 10\ud83e\udd47, 14\ud83e\udd47, 197\ufe0f\u20e3 (a total of 3 gold and 2 bronze, with the 1998 team composed of secondary league or overseas players due to NBA labor disputes; the 2002 team experiencing 3 losses on US soil; the 2006 team experiencing 1 loss; the 2019 team experiencing 2 losses).</p> <p>So why does the United States still make so much effort to form a team for the competition? Is it to promote national prestige? It might have been the case when it was still the Dream Team, but after basketball became globalized, the strength of various countries has rapidly approached, so promoting national prestige is obviously not something that the United States can easily achieve now. The author believes that the main purpose is still for the Olympics, especially after FIBA made the World Cup a way to qualify for the Olympics, countries have attached more importance to the World Cup than before. In this World Cup, FIBA will generate 7 Olympic tickets based on the rankings of participating countries in each continent, including the top 2 in Europe, the top 2 in the Americas (United States and Canada), the top 1 in Asia (Japan), the top 1 in Africa (South Sudan), and the top 1 in Oceania (Australia). Therefore, the author believes that the main goal of the United States team's participation in this competition has been achieved, which is to secure a ticket to the Paris Olympics.</p> <p>Secondly, it is to train players for the Olympics next year. First, in the position of big men, although JJJ may not be a towering presence and may not necessarily be able to defend against European or Australian big men, his ability to protect the rim, help defense, and transition between offense and defense are all suitable for the United States team... His current problem is to handle fouls well and to stabilize his outside shooting to create space. </p> <p>Next is the United States team's main wing player. I think A. Edwards' performance in this competition has already proved that he is at least a version of Kobe for the United States team, if not Wade.</p> <p>However, in the past, the United States team had big wings like Melo or KD, but they are not seen in this team, which is a big crisis. The advantages of big wings in the past are as follows: they can directly shoot from outside after holding the ball, and their three-point shooting is deadly and almost unstoppable. Additionally, compared to other countries' players in the paint, the United States' big wings may have a slight height disadvantage, but they have relatively better physical conditions and can also be used to support the paint when necessary. Unfortunately, B. Ingram, who was expected to be the small KD in this competition, surprised everyone by underperforming from warm-up matches to the actual games.</p> <p>As for Paolo Banchero, I hope Kerr does not use him as a big man. It would be better to train him as an international forward considering his skills.</p> <p>(Note: All editor names have been removed and photo captions have been omitted.)</p>"},{"location":"20230911091510278803/","title":"P","text":"<p>P.LEAGUE Preseason Tournament Kicks Off in Keelung, Cross-League Basketball Invitational Schedule Announced on September 16th</p> <p>Amidst the turmoil in domestic basketball, the Chinese national team is gearing up for the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games at the end of this month.

This had a direct impact on the performance of their star player, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who only scored five points in the first half while accumulating three fouls.</p> <p>On the other hand, Serbia showcased their strong offensive firepower and responded whenever Canada tried to narrow the gap. Canada's disadvantage in the paint was evident, with Serbia outscoring them 22-12 in the area. Bogdan Bogdanovic remained steady for Serbia, contributing 15 points in the first half and leading by 13 points at halftime.</p> <p>In the second half, Dillon Brooks hit two consecutive three-pointers for Canada, but he quickly picked up his fourth foul and was substituted. Although Canada managed to score some points from outside the arc in this quarter, fouls continued to trouble them, and their efforts to catch up were not significant. At the end of the third quarter, Serbia's two crucial three-pointers extended their lead to 12 points.</p> <p>In the final quarter, Serbia's offense flowed smoothly, leading by as much as 17 points. Canada had to call a timeout to regroup. After the timeout, Canada continued to fight back, but Serbia always found an answer to score and maintained a comfortable lead of at least ten points.</p> <p>In the last three minutes, Canada made consecutive mistakes on offense, allowing the point difference to widen to over 15 points. The game was completely controlled by Serbia, who ultimately defeated Canada, advancing to the World Cup final once again since 2014. All players of Serbia performed exceptionally well in this game, with a two-point shooting percentage over 70% and a three-point shooting percentage of 45%. Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 23 points, along with 4 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals. Nikola Milutinov achieved a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds, Ognjen Dobric contributed 16 points, and Marko Guduric added 12 points. Canada struggled with foul troubles, allowing Serbia to dominate their offensive end. RJ Barrett scored the highest for Canada with 23 points, while SGA contributed 15 points and 9 assists, Dillon Brooks had 16 points, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker scored 10 points.</p>"},{"location":"20230911092923418697/","title":"Summary of the Teams in the Pre-season of T1 League Season 3","text":"<p>The third season of T1 League is highly anticipated, with all teams investing heavily in strengthening their rosters   Summary of the Teams in the Pre-season of T1 League Season 3</p> <p>The third season of T1 League is highly anticipated, with all teams investing heavily in strengthening their rosters. With the addition of players from Taiwan Beer Heroes and Yulon Luxgen Leopards, as well as the inclusion of Taiwan Mobile Palicans, there are many exciting aspects to look forward to in the T1 League.</p> <p>In this article, we will provide an overview of each team's situation. Detailed analysis of individual teams will be provided in subsequent articles. Let's get started!</p> <p>Minor Adjustments: Fubon Braves, FamilyMart All-Stars, Taoyuan Eagles</p> <p>These three teams can be considered the most stable teams in the T1 League and were the top three teams last season. While there haven't been major changes this season, they have made targeted reinforcements to address their roster deficiencies.</p> <p>We will not go into too much detail about these teams here, as we will focus on them in the individual team analyses.</p> <p>Fubon Braves: The Braves, who won the championship last season, relied on their European playing style and strong local talent. This season, they have signed two European players, Viktor Gaddefors and Dragan Zekovi\u0107, both of whom have excellent shooting abilities and teamwork skills, making the Braves even stronger in their European playing style.</p> <p>FamilyMart All-Stars: The Kaohsiung-based team did not see any players leave during the off-season, and all the players who were injured last season have returned. They have also re-signed their foreign players, including Aaron Geramipoor and Perry Jones III, to strengthen their inside presence. With the contract extension of head coach Brendan Joyce, the team's local and foreign players have great chemistry, making the All-Stars an exciting team to watch.</p> <p>Taoyuan Eagles: After losing to Fubon Braves in the championship last season, the Eagles have been discussing the issues of height and speed. This season, they have made more changes compared to Fubon Braves and FamilyMart All-Stars. They have acquired Golden Eagles' Marcus Keene, along with the re-signing of Charles Garcia and Kyle Barone. Although the fourth foreign player has not been announced yet, these three foreign players may form the strongest foreign player combination in the T1 League so far. In terms of local players, the team has strengthened its roster by adding Guo Shaojie from the Taipei Dacin Tigers and Gao Chengen from the New Taipei Kings. With the remaining local players re-signed, the Eagles have the potential to become a better team.</p> <p>Moderate Changes: Taichung Suns</p> <p>After their miraculous journey last season, the Taichung Suns have once again strengthened their roster with promising foreign players. They have recruited Davis from Yulon Luxgen Leopards, as well as Nuni Omot from South Sudan. They have also signed Davion Warren, a 24-year-old player who graduated from NCAA Division I. There are rumors that the fourth foreign player for the Suns is Tai Qiang, the leading scorer from Kaohsiung Steel, which would make the Suns' foreign player lineup extremely strong, especially in terms of frontcourt offense. The Suns' general manager, Wang, deserves admiration for his connections and ability to identify talented players. With the addition of head coach Tucker, who led the Suns to second place in the first season, the team is expected to continue their impressive performance.</p> <p>Significant Changes: Taiwan Beer Leopards, Taishin Bank Warriors</p> <p>Finally, we come to the most crucial part of this article, where the changes made by these two teams make the previous four teams' changes look insignificant.</p>"},{"location":"20230911093003519976/","title":"An Unsettled Off-Season for the Warriors and Season Outlook","text":"<p>The Warriors had a disappointing season last year, only making it to the second round of the playoffs    An Unsettled Off-Season for the Warriors and Season Outlook</p> <p>The Warriors had a disappointing season last year, only making it to the second round of the playoffs. The team had high hopes of winning the championship, but various factors such as the atmosphere in the locker room, team injuries, and personal issues with Wiggins affected the team's cohesion.</p> <p>The off-season for the Warriors has been anything but calm. They traded Jordan Poole, who had been with the team for four years, for Chris Paul, who plays the same position. They also drafted Brandin Podziemski from Santa Clara and signed Cory Joseph and Dario Saric in free agency.</p> <p>Looking at the roster, it may seem like the team's strength hasn't changed much. However, as long as the three core players can perform at a normal level and maximize Chris Paul's abilities, the team can still remain competitive.</p> <p>The biggest headache for Steve Kerr is how to manage the backup guards. Should CP3 start or come off the bench? It would be best if CP3 accepts coming off the bench. If he starts alongside Curry, the defense in the backcourt will suffer. Additionally, the Warriors' frontcourt already lacks height, and having Kevon Looney, who is 6'9\", is not enough. If Green plays as a small-ball center, rebounding will be a challenge, and the team will lose its ability to control the paint.</p> <p>Although in the past, Kerr has used a \"Death Lineup\" consisting of Curry, Poole, Thompson, Wiggins, and Green, which opened up the floor, it becomes ineffective if their shooting is off. The probability of grabbing offensive rebounds is low.</p> <p>Furthermore, constantly asking players to play bigger roles can take a toll on their stamina. It would be better to have CP3 play with the second unit to maximize his value. Both Curry and Green need the ball to initiate the offense, so CP3's ball-handling opportunities will be significantly reduced. Although his usage rate has been decreasing over the years, it's not a good idea to have him play off-ball or as a catch-and-shoot player. In other words, his ball-handling percentage will increase when he plays with the second unit.</p> <p>Another issue is CP3's style of play, which heavily relies on pick-and-rolls. The Warriors' system emphasizes setting screens and movement off the ball, so it may take some time for CP3 to adapt.</p> <p>However, I disagree with this notion. In recent years, Curry and Draymond have started using more high pick-and-rolls to create space for Curry to drive or take pull-up shots. I believe Paul can continue to excel in pick-and-roll situations with the Warriors, and Kuminga may benefit from it as well. The key lies in how quickly Chris Paul can integrate into the system. Although his pick-and-roll effectiveness may have declined, he still possesses top-notch pick-and-roll skills that can create good scoring opportunities for himself. Considering Paul's successful pick-and-roll partnership with Ayton on the Suns, as long as Kuminga improves his screening quality, I am confident that Kuminga can thrive in this system.</p> <p>Setting aside the perceived waste of having Chris Paul, who earns $30 million, come off the bench, I believe it's not a waste at all. For now, the focus should be on improving the lack of firepower in the second unit. I trust that CP3 can understand this.</p> <p>Instead of chasing elusive consecutive starting records, it's better to increase the chances of winning a championship in his career. Last season, the Warriors had Donte DiVincenzo, who was capable of maintaining decent outside shooting. Therefore, I hope Brandin Podziemski, who has been selected, can contribute as a reliable shooter off the bench, with the condition that he improves on the defensive end.</p> <p>Podziemski had an impressive college career at Santa Clara, shooting 43.8% from beyond the arc and averaging 2.5 three-pointers per game. Although Santa Clara's conference may not be the most competitive, achieving such a shooting percentage as the team's leading scorer is still remarkable.</p> <p>Moreover, Podziemski's shooting is not limited to catch-and-shoot situations. He has shown the ability to navigate screens and move without the ball, making him a threat from long range. These skills can be amplified when playing with Green and Looney, who excel at setting screens.</p> <p>In situations where Podziemski's shot isn't falling, he can use his playmaking abilities to create opportunities for his teammates. I believe he can provide a boost to the bench scoring, playing around 6-8 minutes per game, and be effective in executing tactics like Split Action and Flare Screen. GPII's role is also crucial in compensating for the poor defense in the backcourt. The regular rotation for the backcourt should look like this: Starting lineup: Curry+Thompson Bench: CP3+Podz+GPII (primarily playing the small forward position but also contributing to backcourt defense).</p> <p>The team has also struggled with turnovers, averaging the highest number of turnovers per game in the league last season at 16.3. They have given away too many fast-break opportunities to opponents, making it difficult to prevent them from scoring. The team has essentially gifted opponents with a significant number of points from turnovers. These are the main reasons for the Warriors' turnovers.</p> <p>Overall, the Warriors have made significant changes during the off-season, and there are still some challenges to overcome. However, with the right adjustments and integration of new players like Chris Paul and Brandin Podziemski, the team has the potential to be competitive and contend for a championship.</p>"},{"location":"20230911093108348875/","title":"Post-match report on Bogdanovic's injury to Borisa's kidney at the FIBA World Cup","text":"<p>Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107    Post-match report on Bogdanovic's injury to Borisa's kidney at the FIBA World Cup</p> <p>Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107.</p> <p>Photo/FIBA World Cup group stage, Serbia vs. South Sudan: A regrettable incident occurred when South Sudan player Nuni Omot struck Borisa Simani\u0107 in the waist with his elbow, causing a kidney injury that ultimately required its removal.

We also saw one of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s make it into the Hall of Fame, who in her first year as a head coach won the WNBA championship, following a brilliant career as a WNBA player.</p> <p>Continuing to read, it is worth considering that for the past five seasons, the NBA MVP award has been won by foreign players. Hence, it is understandable that three international stars are included in the list. Lastly, one of the stars who pioneered the trend of super teams will add another milestone to his personal record. Gregg Popovich can arguably be considered the best at finding ways to win in NBA history. He has won five championship rings, although never in consecutive years. The beauty of his coaching career lies in the fact that the Spurs never relied solely on a championship roster to build a dynasty. Instead, they continuously cultivated excellent players through personnel or style changes, along with subtle adjustments.</p> <p>In fact, Popovich himself faced doubts early in his career. He once called Avery Johnson and David Robinson to his home, telling them that if the team's poor performance resulted in a loss against the Rockets the next day, he believed he might be fired.</p> <p>This ignited the team's passion, as they went on to win 31 out of the last 36 regular-season games, embarking on a journey of greatness.</p> <p>Continuing to read, led by former MVPs Tim Duncan and Robinson, the Spurs won the championship in 1999 and again in 2003. However, with Tony Parker and Manu Gin\u00f3bili becoming the offensive core in 2005 and 2007, the composition of the roster underwent fundamental changes. Yet, under Popovich's leadership, the Spurs still won championships in those seasons. Just when the GDP combination was criticized for their age, a miracle happened in 2014.</p> <p>After experiencing the 2013 NBA Finals, the Spurs welcomed a new lineup. With the aging GDP as the core, along with the addition of superstar Kawhi Leonard, they played an unrelenting selfless style of basketball, prioritizing ball movement over individual star performances. This change led them to defeat the star-studded Miami Heat in five games, winning their fifth championship on the biggest stage of the sport.</p> <p>(It is worth noting that under Popovich's guidance, the Spurs made the playoffs for 22 consecutive years, setting an NBA record.)</p> <p>At the age of 74, Popovich is still the head coach of the Spurs. In a way, he has come full circle in his career in San Antonio: having a potential top pick in the team and aiming to compete for another championship.</p> <p>Becky Hammon, continuing to read, the journey to fame for this point guard was not easy. Even as a scorer, Hammon's skills and talents were somewhat overlooked. Her high school journey was less than ideal, and she went undrafted when entering the professional league.</p> <p>Nevertheless, she quickly made her managers who ignored her look foolish with her dominant performances. She showcased not only her prowess as a sharpshooter but also her exceptional vision and somewhat rough playing style as a resilient playmaker. She began her professional career with the New York Liberty, where she became a fan favorite, and was later traded to the San Antonio Silver Stars. In 2007, 2008, and 2009, she averaged 18.8, 17.6, and 19.5 points, respectively. (Hammon led the Silver Stars to the WNBA Finals in 2008 and became the seventh player in WNBA history to reach the 5,000-point milestone.) In 2013, Hammon suffered an ACL tear that ended her playing career. During her recovery, Popovich allowed her to participate in Spurs practices and coaching meetings, and in 2014, invited her to join the team as the first full-time female assistant coach in league history.</p> <p>Since leaving that position at the end of 2021, Hammon has become the first female coach in WNBA history to win a championship in her first season and may begin her own remarkable coaching career with the Las Vegas Aces.</p> <p>Dwyane Wade, when leading the Miami Heat to their first championship in 2006, was considered the NBA's premier player for a period of time. While Wade may not have been the most exceptional long-range shooter, whenever he took off from mid-range, he became a mobile threat.</p> <p>In addition to his long-distance shooting, he excelled in other areas. Wade was an outstanding athlete and a suffocating defender. Despite standing at just 6 feet 4 inches, he holds the NBA record for the most blocks among all guards.</p> <p>True to his nickname \"Flash,\" he was an agile slasher and would cut to the basket at the most unexpected moments for defenders.</p>"},{"location":"20230911093237836213/","title":"NBA Chinese Professional Baseball League Opening Ceremony Interrupted by Fan Embracing Michael Porter Jr","text":"<p>NBA Chinese Professional Baseball League Opening Ceremony Interrupted by Fan Embracing Michael Porter Jr.</p> <p>September 9, 2023, 18:25 - United Daily News/Reporter Su Zhiyu/Real-time Report</p> <p>NBA Denver Nuggets forward Michael Porter Jr. came to Taiwan to participate in a charity event.

First of all, in terms of substance, the author believes that the significance of this defeat is not very important. Please continue reading because the United States does not value the World Cup (including its predecessor, the FIBA World Championship) as much as the Olympics, so naturally their performance is not as good. Here are the results of the United States team (don't call them the Dream Team, it's unfair to the players) after NBA players were allowed to participate:</p> <p>Olympics: 92\ud83e\udd47, 96\ud83e\udd47, 00\ud83e\udd47, 04\ud83e\udd49, 08\ud83e\udd47, 12\ud83e\udd47, 16\ud83e\udd47, 20\ud83e\udd47 (a total of 7 gold and 1 bronze, experienced 3 losses in 2004 and 1 loss in 2020)</p> <p>World Cup (including its predecessor, the FIBA World Championship): 94\ud83e\udd47, 98\ud83e\udd49, 026\ufe0f\u20e3, 06\ud83e\udd49, 10\ud83e\udd47, 14\ud83e\udd47, 197\ufe0f\u20e3 (a total of 3 gold and 2 bronze, in 1998, the team was composed of players from the minor league or those playing overseas due to NBA labor disputes; in 2002, they experienced 3 losses on home soil; in 2006, they experienced 1 loss; in 2019, they experienced 2 losses)</p> <p>So why does the United States still make such efforts to form a team for the competition? Is it to promote national prestige? It may have been the case when they were still the Dream Team, but after basketball globalized, the strength of various countries has rapidly approached, so promoting national prestige is obviously not something the current United States can easily achieve. The author believes that the goal is still for the Olympics, especially after FIBA made the World Cup a way to qualify for the Olympics, countries have attached more importance to the World Cup than before. In this World Cup, FIBA will generate 7 Olympic tickets based on the ranking of participating countries in each continent: the top two in Europe, the top two in the Americas (United States and Canada), the top team in Asia (Japan), the top team in Africa (South Sudan), and the top team in Oceania (Australia). Therefore, the author believes that the main goal of the United States team in this competition has already been achieved, which is to secure a ticket to the Paris Olympics.</p> <p>Next, it is to train players for the Olympics next year. First, in the big man department: JJJ may not be a towering figure and may not necessarily be able to defend against big men from Europe or Australia, but his ability to protect the rim, help defense, and transition between offense and defense are all suitable for the United States team... His current problem is to handle fouls well and stabilize his outside shooting to create spacing.</p> <p>Next is the United States team's attacking main force - the wings. I think A. Edwards' performance in this competition has already proved that he is at least a version of Kobe for the United States team, if not Wade.</p> <p>However, in the past, the United States team had big wings like Melo or KD, but they are not seen in this team, which is a big crisis. The benefits of having big wings in the past are as follows: they can directly pull up for a shot from the outside after receiving the ball, and their three-point shooting is almost unstoppable and deadly. Moreover, compared to other countries' players in the paint, the United States' big wings may have a slight disadvantage in height, but they have relatively superior physical conditions and can also be used to support the paint when necessary.

Soon after, a similar scene unfolded in Milwaukee, as Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo lay on the court in agony, clutching his back.</p> <p>Without Antetokounmpo, the Bucks lost the opportunity to win their first game of the series.</p> <p>Morant and Antetokounmpo, the two star players of their respective teams, not only suffered injuries in the playoffs, but also had something in common: the way they got injured. Both Morant and Antetokounmpo fell hard after driving to the basket, with defenders attempting to draw an offensive foul.</p> <p>Anthony Davis successfully blocked Morant, while Kevin Love was called for a foul, sending Antetokounmpo to the free-throw line.</p> <p>With star players spending less and less time on the court, the league needs to start thinking about how to keep them on the court for longer. Besides raising the threshold for awards, another issue worth discussing is whether the penalties after fouls are sufficient to protect players from unnecessary harm caused by dangerous landings.</p> <p>Although Morant and Antetokounmpo both missed the following second game, they did not sustain career-ending injuries and returned to play in their respective series.</p> <p>However, we have seen many promising young stars prematurely fall due to injuries, making it a top priority to avoid the next player with a similar experience.</p> <p>The most extreme possibility is to prohibit any help defenders from drawing offensive fouls, an idea proposed by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban in his personal blog in 2004. Cuban acknowledged that the Mavericks were good at drawing offensive fouls and that players willing to endure physical pain for defensive purposes should be commended, but he believed that this rule was \"terrible\" for the NBA. He mentioned in the article, \"Not only does it put both players at risk of injury, but it also weakens some of the most exciting and watchable performances in basketball.</p> <p>Players no longer focus on launching spectacular, incredible shots towards the basket, but instead lower their heads and look at the ground to see if someone will try to impede them by drawing an offensive foul.\"</p> <p>It is worth noting that this proposal would not reduce the blocks made by primary defenders to prevent players like Antetokounmpo from attacking the basket.</p> <p>According to ESPN Stats &amp; Info, he committed 233 offensive fouls on drives in the past 10 seasons, and that only happened when facing opponents who tried to block his drives.</p> <p>Furthermore, even if players can knock down help defenders without being called for traveling, NBA rules also prohibit players from initiating \"non-basketball contact\" beyond the cylinder concept, meaning that deliberate unnecessary shoving against help defenders is not allowed.</p> <p>However, in this era where offensive efficiency is higher than ever before, such changes seem to favor the offensive side too much.</p> <p>When Cuban proposed this idea in 2004, offensive efficiency was at its lowest, so they had to find a way to give an advantage to offensive players. The league's average offensive efficiency in the 2003-04 season was 101.4 points per 100 possessions.</p> <p>This season, that number has risen to 114.1. It is commendable that even before Morant was born, the NBA already had a rule aimed at preventing player injuries, which is the \"restricted area\" under the basket, and since the 1997-98 season, the restricted area has been expanded to its current size (four-foot radius). The NBA was the first league to introduce the restricted area, and later NCAA and FIBA also adopted this regulation.</p> <p>However, since the implementation of this rule 26 years ago, the game has undergone significant changes. Back then, the offensive range was much smaller than it is now.</p> <p>In the 1997-98 season, only 16% of shots came from three-pointers, while this season, the proportion of three-point attempts has reached 39%. As long-range three-pointers become more common, the average shooting distance continues to increase.</p> <p>According to ESPN's statistics, in the 1997-98 season, the average distance of jump shots outside the paint was 18.4 feet (excluding logo shots), while this season, the average shooting distance outside the paint is 22.8 feet, an increase of over 4 feet compared to the past. The expanded offensive space requires defenders to cover more ground, which means they are more likely to move actively to legal defensive positions near the ball handler when they jump from outside the paint.</p> <p>According to the rules, this \"delayed standing\" defensive action is prohibited. Defenders are not allowed to enter the path of the offensive player when the offensive player starts to receive the ball and jump towards the basket.</p> <p>In other words, as long as the offensive player starts to jump towards the basket after receiving the ball, the defender cannot try to step into a position outside the restricted area to draw an offensive foul, which was the reason Love was called for a foul when defending Antetokounmpo. However, in practice, referees find it difficult to simultaneously determine the position of the defender and the timing of the offensive player's jump. Therefore, whether the defender is within the restricted area often becomes the primary criterion for distinguishing between a blocking foul and an offensive foul. That's why Cuban advocates for increasing the radius of the restricted area to five feet. This suggestion is not made hastily; as early as 2006, Cuban publicly proposed expanding the restricted area and hoped it would \"cover the entire paint.\" If the restricted area were larger, Morant's injury case would be considered Davis's foul, and Davis would not attempt to draw an offensive foul at the first opportunity. Instead, Davis might prepare to block Morant's shot, which is his expertise. He contributed a total of seven blocks on Sunday, repeatedly denying the Grizzlies' offense.</p>"},{"location":"20230912125447472803/","title":"Former PLG Hsinchu Reapers player Pan Guanhan was ordered to pay NT$200,000 in compensation for cheating on his wife","text":"<p>Former PLG Hsinchu Reapers player Pan Guanhan was ordered to pay NT$200,000 in compensation for cheating on his wife.

The case can be appealed.</p> <p>Pan Guanhan, a former player for the Hsinchu Reapers, was previously exposed for having an affair with a female fan, and it was revealed that he intended to force his wife and child out of their home. The team immediately announced his release after the news came out.</p> <p>The model wife also filed a lawsuit and demanded joint compensation of NT$500,000 from Pan Guanhan and the female fan. Taipei District Court initially ruled for NT$250,000 in compensation, but upon further consideration of the extramarital affair, the court changed the ruling to NT$300,000. Pan Guanhan's wife, who is a pharmacist and model, claimed that they got married in March 2018, but Pan Guanhan started a relationship with the female fan in February 2021. They referred to each other as husband and wife and exchanged messages such as \"We haven't had sex for five days, can't get wet, lost charm, lost desire\" and \"I just want you.\" The wife believed that Pan Guanhan's interaction with the female fan had harmed their marriage and therefore sued for joint compensation of NT$500,000.</p> <p>The lawyer jointly appointed by Pan Guanhan and the female fan stated that Pan Guanhan had to live in the team dormitory after getting married due to work reasons, which often led to arguments with his wife. In order to support his wife's social media career, Pan Guanhan frequently traveled between Taipei and Hsinchu. His wife had previously requested a divorce multiple times, and their marriage had long been in decline. Pan Guanhan admitted to having sexual relations with someone else but claimed that he and his wife had grown apart and their marriage was already deteriorating. He also argued that his wife was at fault and that the court had already ruled for him to pay NT$300,000 in compensation, so she could not request further compensation. Pan Guanhan agreed to the divorce, but he saw no reason for further compensation.</p> <p>Taipei District Court determined that Pan Guanhan's sexual relations with the female fan violated his spouse's rights and had already been ruled upon in another case. The court acknowledged that the wife had valid reasons to request a divorce and granted the divorce. The court recognized the significant emotional distress the wife had suffered due to Pan Guanhan's consensual sexual relations with others. The wife revealed that Pan Guanhan is currently running a barbecue snack shop with friends, earning around NT$50,000 to NT$60,000 per month.</p> <p>Considering Pan's current situation, Taipei District Court ruled that he must pay an additional NT$200,000 in compensation to his wife.</p>"},{"location":"20230912125525326464/","title":"How South Sudan's basketball soul Luol Deng is saving South Sudan with basketball","text":"<p>When Deng's basketball achievements are mentioned, most fans think of his great accomplishments with the Bulls, including two All-Star selections and one Defensive Player of the Year award    How South Sudan's basketball soul Luol Deng is saving South Sudan with basketball</p> <p>When Deng's basketball achievements are mentioned, most fans think of his great accomplishments with the Bulls, including two All-Star selections and one Defensive Player of the Year award. Please continue reading to learn how Luol Deng, wearing the jersey of the British team at the 2012 Olympics, dreamed of seeing his homeland, South Sudan, reach the highest level. Although Deng has lived in European and American countries throughout his career, he has never forgotten that his roots lie in South Sudan.</p> <p>Please continue reading to learn how Deng has been carrying the flag of South Sudan's basketball and giving back to his homeland long before his retirement.</p> <p>In 2005, Deng established a non-profit organization named after himself, with the goal of providing basketball opportunities for young people and organizing training camps and basketball programs for both genders, expanding from the UK to South Sudan.</p> <p>Continuing on, for the next two years, Deng served as an ambassador for the NBA's Basketball Without Borders program, assisting in various activities, including helping Lost Boys of Sudan refugees and rebuilding a school in South Sudan that his grandfather had built in 1972.</p> <p>At the same time, Deng's foundation not only assists in the education, sports, and psychological counseling of people with disabilities but also serves as the main source of funding for the South Sudan men's and women's basketball teams.</p> <p>\"We have built a school in South Sudan, with nearly two thousand students enrolled, and we have provided over 300 scholarships,\" Deng said.</p> <p>\"Some of them have become doctors or pursued other non-basketball-related professions. Through scholarships and various resources, the young people of South Sudan can grow and develop in all aspects,\" Deng added. Through the NGO organization \"Enough Project,\" Deng has been dedicated to reducing local conflicts and promoting peace in his home country, playing an important role in this goal. In addition, Deng has promoted the construction of 12 basketball courts and sports changing rooms in South Sudan. In 2008, he was awarded the United Nations Humanitarian Award for his contributions to the development and community building in South Sudan. The ongoing civil war in South Sudan has been the problem Deng wants to solve the most, and he has used basketball as a platform to raise funds, provide aid, and create opportunities. \"South Sudan's basketball is undoubtedly something I want to share with everyone,\" Deng said. \"Part of the funds will be donated to the Deng Basketball Academy and help the community, such as bringing in more wheelchairs, allowing doctors to reach more villages for medical treatment, and promoting and advocating for mental health-related issues, which are major concerns in the South Sudanese community.\"</p> <p>In 2012, the NBA established NBA Africa, including basketball training academies, facilities, organizing the African league, and promoting social issues such as gender equality and improving the African economy. In addition to Deng, former NBA players Grant Hill, Ian Mahinmi, Dikembe Mutombo, and Joakim Noah are also investors, and former US President Barack Obama is an investor and strategic partner. Deng grew up in South Sudan, and his family has been leaders for generations. His father even served as a government official, including the position of deputy prime minister. When the second civil war broke out in Sudan, Deng's family first fled to Egypt and then sought political asylum in the UK. Deng also had the opportunity to learn from former NBA player Manute Bol during his time in Egypt, which paved the way for his basketball career.</p> <p>Bol's humanitarian efforts in Sudan were more famous than his ten-year NBA career. He was a member of the Advisory Board of Sudan Sunrise, an organization dedicated to promoting peace in Sudan and establishing 41 schools in South Sudan. Bol founded the Ring True Foundation to raise funds for the reconstruction and assistance of Sudan, and he invested most of his NBA salary into the foundation.</p> <p>\"He is not only a basketball legend in Africa but also an important figure in helping South Sudan gain independence,\" Deng said. Deng has continued Bol's torch and has been using basketball to aid South Sudan. He built an outdoor basketball court in Juba, South Sudan, named after Bol, where over a thousand children are learning basketball.</p> <p>Deng made his first visit to South Sudan in 2010, and in 2011, he donated a portion of his salary to help the people who had been displaced due to the civil war and turmoil to return home to vote in the independence referendum. South Sudan officially declared independence in July 2011.</p> <p>Around the same time, Deng became involved with the South Sudan Basketball Federation and obtained official recognition from FIBA in December 2013.</p> <p>Despite Deng's resources, South Sudan's basketball resources are still lacking. Apart from the outdoor courts Deng built, there are no comprehensive training facilities. As a result, international games often require teams to arrive early to practice.</p> <p>\"Before joining the British team, Sudan came to recruit me when the country was in the midst of a civil war. I felt it was not suitable at the time and declined, but the idea of representing Sudan has always resonated in my heart,\" Deng said. After establishing the basketball federation in 2011, Deng has been in contact with many local South Sudanese players with representation qualifications. \"Since establishing the federation, I have felt that South Sudanese players cherish this opportunity. They not only get to represent the country in games but also contribute to society and feel the support of the people, improving the country's image,\" Deng added. Even when he was playing in the NBA, Deng maintained contact with South Sudanese players, arranging training camps and games for them.</p>"},{"location":"20230912125636417443/","title":"Interview with the cutest sports anchor, Li Yihan: A sports jersey represents not only a team but also a spirit","text":"<p>Interview with the cutest sports anchor, Li Yihan: A sports jersey represents not only a team but also a spirit.</p> <p>Li Yihan, currently working as a sports anchor at ETTV, recalls her first time hosting an event, which was an outdoor basketball game in Taoyuan.

The Celtics' decision to invest heavily in re-signing Brown can be attributed to the strong duo formed by Brown and Tatum last season, who combined for an average of 56.7 points per game. They scored over 30 points each in 10 games, a feat achieved only by the \"O'Bryant Connection\" of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the past 30 years. Additionally, according to Second Spectrum, 54% of Brown's scoring last season came from unassisted shots, and he averaged 1.15 points per drive, setting a new career high.</p>"},{"location":"20230913091457887394/","title":"Introduction to Fukushima Commercial High School's International Team for the Chang Yao Cup","text":"<p>When it comes to the Fukushima region in Japan, it is hard to escape the impression of a \"city of tragedy   Introduction to Fukushima Commercial High School's International Team for the Chang Yao Cup</p> <p>When it comes to the Fukushima region in Japan, it is hard to escape the impression of a \"city of tragedy.\" In the past, the area has experienced tragedies such as nuclear power accidents, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Despite the challenges faced in the overall industrial development of the region, the local citizens have always shown enthusiastic support for sports and its development. Starting with professional baseball, soccer, and basketball teams in the area, Fukushima is united in its hope to reshape the external perception through sports. Fukushima Commercial High School is a boys' basketball team that has emerged in such an environment and spirit.</p> <p>In 2003, the basketball team of Fukushima Commercial High School was established, led by Coach Shinya Mizuno.

Despite not being able to strengthen their overall competitiveness through recruiting foreign players due to the system of public schools in Japan, the emphasis in today's Japanese basketball on cultivating more local players is highly valued and anticipated.</p> <p>Fukushima Commercial High School actively challenges higher stages starting from local competitions. After completing their participation in the China-Japan-Korea Youth Exchange Tournament at the end of August, Coach Mizuno will lead the Fukushima Commercial High School boys' basketball team to Taiwan. For this team, which continues to challenge and grow, participating in the Chang Yao Cup is an important preparation for the Winter Cup in November.

Please continue reading to learn more.</p> <p>During the official press conference before the opening game against New Zealand on August 26th, both Steve Kerr and Jalen Brunson were interviewed about their first impressions of the Philippines and the challenges they are about to face. However, for Kerr personally, August 24th holds a special significance.</p> <p>\"August 24th is my mother's birthday, and that's what stands out to me the most about this day,\" Kerr replied with a smile when asked about his memories of Kobe Bryant.</p> <p>He humorously added, \"Happy birthday, Mom, but I'm sure she's not watching right now.\" Reflecting on his memories of Kobe, Kerr said, \"I had the opportunity to play against him as a player, and after I started coaching in the later stages of Kobe's career, I have cherished memories with him. It was a great privilege to be on the same court as one of the greatest players in NBA history. We still remember Kobe and what he meant to all of us and the entire league.\"</p> <p>The USA team is currently competing in the FIBA World Cup, with the mission of reclaiming the world championship title after finishing in 7th place in 2019, which was the second-worst result in the history of the USA team.</p> <p>However, after losing to Lithuania and Germany in the quarterfinals, it is confirmed that the USA team will not win the gold medal this time.</p> <p>Source of the photo: Getty Images. Kerr, who took over as the head coach of the USA team this year, has previously discussed his experiences as an assistant coach under Gregg Popovich in 2019 and 2021, and how it has influenced his role as the national team head coach.</p> <p>Kerr praised the team, saying, \"That experience really determined how we selected this team. We wanted players who we believed could come together as a team in a short period of time.\"</p> <p>\"We have a great group of players who are connected to each other, can pass the ball, and enjoy this experience,\" he added.</p> <p>Kerr also admitted that his team learned valuable lessons in the early stages. The USA team won all five warm-up games against Puerto Rico (117-74), Slovenia (92-62), Spain (98-88), Greece (108-86), and Germany (99-91).</p> <p>\"The most important thing is to be familiar with FIBA rules and to be united. Throughout this process, we faced strong opponents, and while we have confidence, we also faced some setbacks. Spain and Germany presented challenges, and these experiences have helped us because we know how talented these teams are,\" Kerr praised the German and Spanish teams that pushed them to their limits during the warm-up games.</p> <p>For the USA team, anything other than a gold medal is considered a failure, but the team's point guard, Jalen Brunson, does not shy away from the challenge.</p> <p>\"For me personally, there is no such thing as 'pressure',\" the New York Knicks star responded when asked about pressure. \"I understand that as long as I give my best in my game, there is no such thing as pressure. There are moments and situations that require facing tough odds, but my confidence comes from my professional ethics. As long as I continue to work hard and understand that I strive for improvement every day, there is no pressure. I think for the team, in such moments, we rely heavily on each other,\" Brunson analyzed.</p> <p>Kerr, who won the gold medal in the FIBA World Cup in 1986, also talked about the weight of responsibility. Kerr explained, \"Pressure is self-imposed. We all love what we do, and I love coaching. I also love pressure or what we call competition. Being a competitor means accepting the possibility of defeat. That's the essence of the game, there are wins and losses.\" He also added, \"Effort, approach, and chemistry are key. I love being part of a team, I love what we are doing right now, trying to build something and putting something on the line. Of course, the charm of sports is that there is no risk to our lives. However, we compete, we give our all, we strive to win honors, and we know that failure may come with criticism, and we are okay with that.\" Kerr concluded, \"But our mindset is that this is an incredibly enjoyable thing. We are extremely fortunate to be a part of all this, to compete, and when we look back on all this in our lives, we know that we gave it our all. Like I said, we are working hard, and we want to win, but whatever happens, happens, and we accept it.

Here is the statement:</p> <ol> <li>The PLG Lions have always respected the regulations of the former team during the contract negotiations with Lin Ping-Sung.</li> </ol> <p>When the representatives of the PLG Lions were discussing and signing the contract with Lin Ping-Sung, they added a note in Article 3, Clause 5 of the contract, stating that \"if the original team matches the offer within one month after the signing of this contract, the contract will not take effect.\"</p> <p>This was done to protect the original team's right of first refusal. Furthermore, under the free competition of the two leagues, there are no clauses in the T1 League regarding contact with free agents. Therefore, how could the PLG Lions be accused of maliciously poaching players? Moreover, the original team has not issued any statement accusing the PLG Lions of such actions. Taishin, on the other hand, is twisting the truth by accusing the PLG Lions of maliciously poaching players. We believe that the fans and Taiwanese society can judge for themselves.</p> <ol> <li>Lin Ping-Sung's signing was done entirely of his own free will. When Lin Ping-Sung personally signed the contract, he was accompanied by his friends and family at a Starbucks in Beitou. There were also many customers and staff present.</li> </ol> <p>How could an adult, signing a contract in broad daylight with friends and family present, not take responsibility for his own signature? And where does the claim of Lin Jui-Chiang, the head coach, attempting to persuade him to sign come from?</p> <ol> <li>Lin Ping-Sung continued to negotiate contract details with the PLG Lions after June 28th. In the Taishin press conference, Lin Ping-Sung falsely claimed that he had expressed his decision not to join the PLG Lions to the team representatives from June 28th to August 14th. However, in reality, he continued to privately negotiate with the PLG Lions representatives between August 8th and August 14th regarding \"CBA overseas clause, personal incentive bonuses, rental assistance in Hsinchu, training expense subsidies, jersey numbers,\" and other matters. The screenshots provided clearly refute the lies told in the Taishin press conference.</li> </ol> <p>Taishin, in their press release, attempts to twist the truth by claiming that \"Lin Ping-Sung clearly informed the PLG Lions representatives multiple times that he has no intention of joining.\" However, with these clear screenshots, how can they say that he had no intention of joining?</p> <ol> <li>Taishin does not respect the consensus reached during the Chinese Basketball Association's mediation meeting. The Chinese Basketball Association released a statement after the mediation meeting on September 4th, stating, \"Although there is no conclusion reached in this mediation meeting, we hope to propose negotiation conditions under the premise of mutual benefit. After both sides' representatives report the content of the mediation meeting to the headquarters, a decision will be made on whether to hold a second mediation meeting based on the subsequent situation.\" On September 5th, the PLG Lions received a response from the Chinese Basketball Association, in which Taishin only agreed to negotiate with Lin Ping-Sung directly. This reply violates the consensus reached between the two teams during the mediation meeting.</li> </ol> <p>Finally, the PLG Lions want to emphasize that since the lawsuit has been filed, has Lin Ping-Sung breached the contract? Is Taishin maliciously poaching players? Let the court, Fair Trade Commission, and all fans in Taiwan decide! If Taishin continues to twist the truth and openly lie, the PLG Lions will continue to provide evidence.

They also made history by winning a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics. The remarkable success of Japanese basketball can be attributed to the comprehensive reforms introduced in the \"Japan Sports Promotion Plan\" since 2013. Whether it is in professional development or nurturing young talents, Japan has become a model worth emulating.</p> <p>Among the invited teams for this year's Chao Yao Cup International Tournament, Sakura Gakuen High School stands out as an important breeding ground for Japan's new generation of female basketball players. Located in Aichi Prefecture, Sakura Gakuen High School is often referred to as the \"Japanese national team factory\". Established in 1980, this team has a rich history and has won an impressive 71 national championships, including the most championships in the current Japan Winter Cup (24 times) and the most championships in the Inter-High Basketball Tournament (25 times). They also hold the record for the highest score in a single game in the women's division of the Inter-High Basketball Tournament (139 points) and have achieved a five-year consecutive championship streak (1992-1996) in the National Sports Festival Basketball Competition for High School Division.</p> <p>One of their famous achievements includes a legendary victory in the 2014 Inter-High Aichi Prefecture qualifying tournament, where they defeated Toyake High School with an astonishing score of \"268:0\". Sakura Gakuen High School's unique and innovative playing style, combining both Eastern and Western elements, has shattered the stereotype that Asian basketball players are physically disadvantaged. Not only have they consistently achieved great success in high school basketball, earning a dynasty-like status, but they have also produced many notable players who have made their mark in the international basketball scene. These include WNBA player Ramu Tokashiki from the Seattle Storm, main center players Maki Takada and Minaho Miyoshi, Japanese-Ghanaian sisters Evelyn and Stephanie Mawuli, and former WNBA player Tomoko Daidai who was recently announced as an inductee of the FIBA Hall of Fame. Maki Takada, a key member of the Japanese national team that won the silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics, is also a graduate of Sakura Gakuen High School.</p> <p>Sakura Gakuen High School has established a deep connection with Taiwan through previous exchanges, including their victory in the 2017 Grandmother's Cup and their participation in the 2018 Yangming Cup International Women's Basketball Invitational Tournament against Taipei Yangming High School. This year, they have once again come to Taiwan to participate in the Chao Yao Cup, bringing a roster that includes co-captains Kokoro Kurokawa and Mana Tanaka, as well as the \"Asian prodigy\" center player Rina Fukuwara. Additionally, four freshmen players, Nana Nagahamada, Mina Abe, Anzu Kanazawa, and Sakura Yamada, who were key players in the U16 Asian Youth Championship, where they defeated Taiwan's young female basketball players by a 47-point difference, are also part of their team.</p> <p>With such an experienced and international lineup, it will be exciting to see what kind of \"education\" Sakura Gakuen will bring to Taiwanese female basketball players.</p> <p>Sakura Gakuen High School, which has confirmed its participation in the Chao Yao Cup this year, has expressed their anticipation of participating in international competitions again after the pandemic. They look forward to observing and absorbing the strengths of various countries, and incorporating them to develop a more globally competitive \"new Japanese style\" of basketball.</p> <p>As the current leader in domestic high school basketball, Sakura Gakuen aspires to become a cradle for student players with greater representation and influence in the international basketball community. This is undoubtedly an ambitious goal and a milestone they are working towards.</p>"},{"location":"20230913092432490393/","title":"Article: It must be said that this year's dunk contest was surprisingly exciting","text":"<p>Article: It must be said that this year's dunk contest was surprisingly exciting.</p> <p>Why? Mainly because the past few dunk contests have been quite lackluster. But honestly, it's not their fault. I often feel that after the classic showdown between Aaron Gordon and Zach Lavine in 2016, the audience's taste has been raised. If they can't come up with more creative dunks, more explosive tension, or more elegant aerial displays, then naturally it will be considered boring. However, these dunks require a high level of talent (jumping ability, hang time) to perform, and even if you have the talent, you still need to innovate in terms of creativity. These conditions have become a high barrier for dunk contests to surpass in terms of viewership. But Mac McClung, a white guard who emerged from the development league, has refreshed everyone's perspective. \"He deserves to be in the NBA.\" \"Although he is a bit short, this kid can really jump.\" \"I believe Mac McClung won't miss a dunk.\" \"He might even set a record for a non-NBA player winning the dunk contest.\" Pre-game analyst Shaquille O'Neal didn't hesitate to show his appreciation for this young man. So who is Mac McClung?</p> <p>Mac McClung has been a talented athlete since he was young. Despite his height of only 188 cm, his explosive athleticism sets him apart from his peers. He was an absolute key player on his high school basketball team and even broke the school's all-time scoring record.</p> <p>The previous record holder, Allen Iverson, is not a nobody but a famous former basketball star. \"He has been very good to me, a great mentor. He has taught me a lot of things that will be very helpful for my future.\" McClung's impressive performance naturally caught Iverson's attention, and he invited the young guard to participate in his own classic game. During the game, McClung's dunks left a deep impression on Iverson, and according to McClung's recollection, Iverson even had a good conversation with him after the game.</p> <p>It is his outstanding offensive ability that attracted many college invitations for McClung. Ultimately, he chose to attend Georgetown University, just like Iverson. However, the increased intensity from high school to college affected McClung's offensive ability, and his shooting percentage was not ideal. Even after transferring schools after two years, there was no improvement in the new environment.</p> <p>After all, his height was too short, and if his ball handling and shooting skills weren't top-notch... Yes! At this level, being top-notch is not enough. Without being super elite to compensate for his height disadvantage, it's really difficult to survive on the college court, let alone the NBA.</p> <p>So after spending three years in college and realizing that his draft projections hadn't changed much, McClung ultimately decided to enter the draft and pursue his dream.</p> <p>Unlike a passionate manga, he was not drafted. In the 2021 draft, no team was willing to give him a chance.</p> <p>But this didn't deter McClung from pursuing his dream of playing in the NBA. He immediately sought opportunities in the development league and spent time with the Lakers, Bulls, and Warriors' development teams. He eventually signed a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers this year, but he still spent most of his time honing his skills in the development league.</p> <p>\"I feel a bit careless on the defensive end. I need to find ways to improve in every game. I think I've done well in lob passes. But in other types of passes, I can definitely do better.\" McClung worked hard to refine his skills in the development league. When he was released by the Warriors last season, head coach Steve Kerr had a serious conversation with him, pointing out that as a player of his height, he needed to improve his passing skills in addition to scoring. Under McClung's efforts to improve, he was named the Development League's Rookie of the Year last season.</p> <p>\"If it happens, it would be amazing! It means I've earned recognition in the NBA!\" In fact, McClung is like a player in a game who allocates all his points to athleticism. His flexibility is amazing, and he often uploads videos of himself dunking on his personal social media platforms, garnering more fans than some NBA players.</p> <p>He didn't stop his high-flying dunks just because he was in the development league. On the contrary, many fans look forward to his spectacular dunks every night. It is this high popularity that caught the attention of the league and allowed him to participate in this year's dunk contest.</p> <p>\"I'm lucky and grateful for the opportunity given to me by the NBA.\" For his first dunk, McClung flew over two defenders, tapped the ball off the backboard, and then threw it down, showcasing both difficulty and creativity, earning him a perfect score of 50.</p> <p>For his second dunk, McClung jumped up, pulled a 360-degree spin in the air, and then dunked the ball, with one judge even already raising a 50-point sign. However, in the total score, because one judge gave him only 49 points, McClung's score was 49.8, which was enough for him to enter the final.</p> <p>For his third dunk, McClung flew over one defender, executed two spins in the air, and then threw down a reverse dunk, earning a perfect score of 50 without any controversy. For his final dunk, McClung put on his high school jersey, jumped and rotated nearly 540 degrees in the air, and then dunked the ball. After landing, he imitated Vince Carter's famous gesture from a past dunk contest, saying, \"It's over.\" This dunk received applause from the entire arena without any doubt, and McClung won the dunk contest championship.</p> <p>\"If you guys are willing to have me, I'll definitely come back.\" After the game, when asked if he would defend his title next year, McClung said he would be more than happy to as long as he is still in the league. Perhaps he also knows that he still has many shortcomings if he wants to establish himself in the league. After all, there have been many players who have won the dunk contest but lost their place in the NBA. \"I've always wanted to see some scenery I've never seen before. I hope I can achieve it with my dunks.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230913092536874613/","title":"The Denver Nuggets, in their 47th year in the NBA, defeated the Miami Heat with a final score of 94-89 to claim their first-ever NBA championship","text":"<p>The Denver Nuggets, in their 47th year in the NBA, defeated the Miami Heat with a final score of 94-89 to claim their first-ever NBA championship.

Despite Tyler Herro, the second-leading scorer for the Heat with an average of 20.1 points per game during the regular season, returning from injury, the Heat struggled to maintain their early lead. The Nuggets, led by Bam Adebayo's scoring, managed to take a 24-22 lead at the end of the first quarter.</p> <p>The Nuggets struggled with their three-point shooting in the first half, making only 1 out of 15 attempts. With Adebayo's 18 points, the Heat held a 51-44 lead at halftime.</p> <p>In the second half, the Nuggets, with Jamal Murray's three-pointer, tied the game at 60-60. The two teams engaged in a back-and-forth battle, with Michael Porter Jr.'s three-pointer giving the Nuggets the lead while Kyle Lowry's three-pointer helped the Heat regain the advantage. At the end of the third quarter, the Heat maintained a slim lead of 71-70. In the final quarter, the Nuggets took the lead after Jokic's basket and extended it to seven points at one point, but the Heat, led by Jimmy Butler's scoring, fought back to regain the lead. With 27 seconds remaining in the game, the Heat trailed 89-90 but made a critical turnover, allowing the Nuggets to secure the victory with four successful free throws. The Nuggets won the series 4-1 and claimed their first NBA championship since joining the league in 1976.</p> <p>In this game, Jokic contributed 28 points and 16 rebounds, while Porter Jr. recorded 16 points and 13 rebounds. Murray added 14 points and 8 assists.</p> <p>For the Heat, five players scored in double digits, with Butler leading the team with 21 points and Adebayo contributing 20 points and 12 rebounds. However, the Heat's overall rebounding performance, with 50 rebounds compared to the Nuggets' 71, proved to be a significant disadvantage.</p> <p>The Denver Nuggets' victory in the NBA Finals marks a historic moment for the franchise. The team underwent a five-year rebuilding phase before Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, and coach Michael Malone led them to become the second team to win an NBA championship after merging from the American Basketball Association (ABA) into the NBA. The ABA and NBA were rival leagues until the ABA merged into the NBA in 1976, leaving only four ABA teams in today's NBA, including the Denver Nuggets, Brooklyn Nets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs.</p> <p>The Spurs won their first championship in 1999, and now the Nuggets have become the second ABA team to win an NBA championship.</p> <p>Founded in 1967 as one of the original ABA teams, the Nuggets were initially known as the Larks but changed their name to the Rockets before the first season and then to the Nuggets in 1974. They reached the ABA Finals in the last season before the ABA-NBA merger in 1976 but lost to the New York Nets.</p> <p>Whether in the ABA or NBA, the Nuggets have consistently been a playoff team. In the nine seasons they competed in the ABA, they made the playoffs every time but only reached the Finals once. After joining the NBA, the Nuggets made the playoffs nine times in the 1980s and had a streak of 10 consecutive playoff appearances from 2004 to 2013. However, they never won a championship despite their consistent success.</p> <p>Despite entering a rebuilding phase from the 2013-14 season onwards, the Nuggets quietly laid the foundation for their future success. They drafted Jokic in 2014, Murray in 2016, and Michael Porter Jr. in 2018. In 2015, they hired Malone as their coach. All these pieces finally came together in the 2018-19 season when they achieved a record of 54 wins and 28 losses, securing the second seed in the Western Conference.</p> <p>Throughout their 47-year history, the Nuggets have had many notable players, including Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, and Carmelo Anthony. With George Karl as their coach, they played an exciting, offensive style of basketball in the 2000s, which stood out in an era dominated by defensive strategies. In 1999, they moved to their current home, the Pepsi Center, which is located at an elevation of 5,280 feet. The thin air at the high altitude has earned the Nuggets a reputation for having a significant home-court advantage.</p> <p>Jokic, initially known for his slightly overweight appearance, underwent a transformation after his coach convinced him to give up his soda-drinking habit. He focused on getting in better shape and gradually became a dominant force on the court, eventually earning the title of MVP. Jokic, 28 years old and standing at 6 feet 11 inches, was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft with the 41st overall pick.</p> <p>From the beginning of his NBA career, Jokic displayed exceptional skills and was selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.

The basketball scene in Taiwan has not stopped either. P.LEAGUE+ today announced the information regarding the 2023-24 season preseason games. The cross-league games that debuted last year will continue this year. Not only will the Taipei Fubon Braves, the newly joined team from the T1 League, participate, but also National Chengchi University, who recently completed a three-peat in the University Basketball Association (UBA). Taiwan basketball is very busy during this offseason. The recently concluded William Jones Cup, which resumed after a three-year hiatus, and the schedule for the Chengdu World University Games representative team have just been completed. However, the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in August, which our country was supposed to compete in, were eventually withdrawn due to the event being held in Damascus, Syria, which is classified as a travel red alert zone. The originally planned training camp, mainly consisting of T1 League players, has disbanded.</p> <p>Please continue reading. Taiwan also has two other teams participating in the Jones Cup, named Chinese Blue and Chinese White, respectively. Chinese Blue is composed of current national team players and will also compete in the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games. In the later stages of the Jones Cup, the contract disputes between Lin Ping-Hsuan and the P.LEAGUE+ Hsinchu JLions and the T1 League Taipei Fubon Braves are still ongoing. This week, the JLions have filed a lawsuit, and both parties have decided to go to court. Furthermore, there have been negative reports about the former head coach of the Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology Basketball Team instructing an assistant to vandalize a car. Amongst all these news, it is clear that the offseason of Taiwan basketball has not come to a halt. (Image source: P.LEAGUE+)</p> <p>Today, P.LEAGUE+ released a statement announcing the schedule for the 2023-24 season preseason games. Last year's preseason games were held at the Fengshan Gymnasium, home of the Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology Basketball Team. This year, the Jeoutai Technology Basketball Team remains the preseason partner of the league, but the games will be moved from the \"Harbor City\" to Keelung, also known as the \"Rain City\". The games will take place from October 7th to 9th, with a total of six matches, bringing professional basketball back to Keelung, where adult-level basketball games haven't been held for many years. The schedule for the P.LEAGUE+ 2023-24 season preseason games is as follows: Venue    Date       Time       Match Keelung Municipal Gymnasium October 7th (Saturday)     14:30      Dreamers vs. JLions                                                       17:00      Bank of Taiwan vs. Warriors October 8th (Sunday)        14:30      JLions vs. Yulon Luxgen Dinos                                                       17:00      Taiwan Beer vs. Dreamers October 9th (Monday)      14:30      Yulon Luxgen Dinos vs. Warriors                                                       17:00      Bank of Taiwan vs. Taiwan Beer</p> <p>Please continue reading. During the previous offseason, P.LEAGUE+, T1 League, and the Super Basketball League (SBL) participated in the cross-league games together. In the end, the Taiwan Beer Bears from the T1 League defeated the Xinbei Citic Kaohsiung Braves to win the championship, successfully showcasing the three leagues/competitions competing and collaborating on the same court. Although each team has varying degrees of training purposes, the games are still highly anticipated. There have been reports that the cross-league games may continue after several international competitions, and seven teams have already confirmed their participation. The SBL will be represented by Taiwan Bank, Changhua Jets, and Taiwan Beer. P.LEAGUE+ will be represented by the Dreamers and Yulon Luxgen Dinos. The T1 League will have the Taipei Fubon Braves, who have been the talk of the town this offseason. Additionally, there will be a Chinese Asian Games training team and National Chengchi University from the UBA participating.</p> <p>(Image source: Chinese Taipei Basketball Association) SBL teams that participated in the cross-league games last year also showed competitive performances. They will participate again this year. After generating so much buzz during the offseason, it will be interesting to see how the newly formed Taipei Fubon Braves perform in actual games and whether Lin Ping-Hsuan will take the court. As for National Chengchi University, which dominated the UBA for the past three seasons and is known as the \"Political Universe,\" it will be intriguing to see if they can demonstrate their excellent skills against higher-level teams as they prepare for the new UBA season. This is undoubtedly a hot topic of discussion in various circles.

The team's major moves have been re-signing Jerami Grant and following up on Matisse Thybulle's offer.</p> <p>With star player Damian Lillard requesting a trade, the Trail Blazers are inevitably heading towards a rebuilding phase, with Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe as the core of their roster for the upcoming season. However, the team has yet to complete a trade involving Lillard, and there have been no significant changes to the roster. Moses Brown was initially a two-way player for the Trail Blazers.</p> <p>The main reason for the delay in trading Lillard is dissatisfaction with the trade offers from other teams. Although the situation is currently at a standstill, it seems unlikely that Lillard will represent the Trail Blazers in the upcoming season, whether a trade is completed before the start of the season or not.</p> <p>While the team claims to wait for a satisfactory offer before completing a trade, the overall team operation has been stagnant due to the trade impasse. Currently, the Trail Blazers have only 13 players under contract, including Moses Brown on a non-guaranteed deal.</p> <p>If the intention is not to acquire more players after a trade, the roster should not be so thin. Therefore, the Trail Blazers have essentially made no reinforcements in the free agency market. Compared to previous seasons where they fought for a playoff spot, the team now has less pressure in terms of performance, but the issue of a vacant paint cannot be ignored. The departures this summer include Drew Eubanks and Trendon Watford, who had the most bench minutes as the 5th man last season, but the team has only added Moses Brown as a replacement.</p> <p>With starting center Jusuf Nurkic's recent injury concerns (and even uncertainty about his presence on the team at the start of the season), the frontcourt situation for the new season is precarious.</p> <p>Even with the addition of Jerami Grant, the team only has five suitable forwards, one of whom is Nassir Little. The other three are rookies Kris Murray, Rayan Rupert, and sophomore Jabari Walker.</p> <p>Little also has durability issues, and the other three young and inexperienced forwards can only provide limited contributions immediately. Unless something unexpected happens, the Trail Blazers will continue to rely on their backcourt players to cover the frontcourt responsibilities, as they have done in recent years. Half of the players are still on rookie contracts, and excluding Lillard, the team only has Jerami Grant and Jusuf Nurkic over the age of 27. This roster does not inspire confidence.</p> <p>Although this situation allows Scoot Henderson, this year's draft pick, to have plenty of playing time, it seems that the Trail Blazers will not be competitive in the next season, especially in the highly competitive Western Conference.</p> <p>The lack of depth in the frontcourt not only poses problems for the team's defense but also increases the risk of injuries as players are forced to play out of position. Even if there is no intention to increase competitiveness, the frontcourt is currently depleted to the point where there are almost no available players. Is the team really planning to play a full 82-game season with this roster?</p> <p>In the past two seasons, the Trail Blazers started with ambitions of making the playoffs, only to surrender and rest their key players after a losing streak, aiming for better draft positions.</p> <p>This season, it's hard to see how the Trail Blazers can compete with the stronger teams in the Western Conference in terms of frontcourt and interior strength.</p> <p>Although the team hasn't explicitly stated it, their recent actions and developments resemble a \"Trust The Process\" approach, where they accumulate talented young players over the years. The hiring of two assistant GMs, one with experience from the Hinkie era of the 76ers, and the other a long-time draft analyst, indicates the team's clear direction. While Mike Schmitz has been performing well, it's apparent that the Trail Blazers brought him in not with the intention of contending for a championship.</p>"},{"location":"20230914093728789337/","title":"The feeling of representing the country in the international arena is very different for Tyrese Haliburton and the chemistry with the USA team","text":"<p>The feeling of representing the country in the international arena is very different for Tyrese Haliburton and the chemistry with the USA team.</p> <p>Before the start of the World Cup this year, Tyrese Haliburton talked to Basketball Sphere about the various challenges and expectations he had for the World Cup and the USA team.</p> <p>Four years ago, the USA team finished in the worst seventh place in World Cup history.

This season, the Warriors have once again recruited several talented players with the goal of winning a fourth consecutive championship.</p> <p>The Stability of the Veterans: As the saying goes, having an experienced player is like having a treasure. The Fubon Warriors have at least three veteran players who continue to perform at a high level.</p> <p>Lin Chih-chieh, known as \"The Beast,\" is an unstoppable force and has proven himself to be the top player in Taiwanese basketball with his outstanding performance in the playoffs.</p> <p>Jet Chang's sharp breakthroughs, excellent finishes, and consistent performance demonstrate his ability to dominate games. Veteran Tsai Wen-cheng efficiently contributes points and has even delivered game-winning shots.</p> <p>With these three players on the team, the Warriors stand undefeated. The Rise of the Mid-generation Players: In the previous season, we witnessed the impressive performances of mid-generation players like Chang Wen-ping and Hsieh Tsung-jung, who often played the role of surprise contributors, helping the team secure crucial victories. Chang Wen-ping's memorable three-point shot in the championship series helped the Warriors secure a critical win. Hsieh Tsung-jung's performance in the paint was also remarkable, and if they continue to seize playing time this season, they have the potential to perform even better and contribute to the team's success. The Emergence of the Rookies: The Warriors' most anticipated aspect is the rise of their young players. Players like Chien Ting-chao, Hung Kai-chieh, and Chen Fan-bo-yen have all shown impressive performances while playing for the Chinese Taipei White Team. Chien Ting-chao and Hung Kai-chieh, as the team's first and second options, impressed in the Jones Cup, particularly with Chien Ting-chao's control of the game's pace and Hung Kai-chieh's drives to the basket. Chen Fan-bo-yen's performance deserves special mention. Despite initially being on the bench, he earned the coaching staff's recognition with his precise three-point shooting and solid defense, leading to his promotion to the starting lineup. Chen Fan-bo-yen's exceptional talent, showcased in last year's physical fitness test, will undoubtedly make him a key player for the Warriors in the future.</p> <p>Additionally, the inclusion of Zhou Gui-yu and Tseng Hsiang-chun in the Chinese Taipei Blue Team is a testament to their impressive performances last year. Tseng Hsiang-chun, a 205cm local center with three-point shooting ability and good lateral movement, earned his spot in the national team through his skills. Zhou Gui-yu's outstanding defense against Manny Harris in the finals amazed fans, and he rightfully secured a place in the Chinese Taipei Blue Team's 18-man roster. Zhou Gui-yu's evident improvement in shooting accuracy, defensive pressure, and ability to score after driving to the basket demonstrates his potential. With more playing time next season, he will fully showcase his skills.</p> <p>The Torch Continues: The torch of the Fubon Warriors' legacy seems to have smoothly passed to the young players' hands.</p> <p>Continued Contracts with Foreign Players: The Warriors have re-signed all three of their foreign players for this season. It is well-known that these players possess exceptional skills, and their excellent teamwork sets them apart from foreign players on other teams. This is the Warriors' greatest advantage. For example, in the semi-finals against the Yulon Luxgens, Xavier Alexander played a crucial role. In the championship series against the Formosa Dreamers, coach Xu Zhin-jiun chose to pair Marcus Keene with Charles Garcia, which ultimately led to their championship victory. This proves that these three foreign players have excellent compatibility with the team and are indispensable for the Warriors' championship aspirations.</p> <p>Off-season Strengthening: During the off-season, the Warriors made several additions to their roster. They selected Tsai Chen-yueh, a 197cm power forward, in the draft. Tsai possesses excellent physical qualities. They also signed a new foreign player, Shi Men, whose athletic abilities are evident from various videos. However, their most significant reinforcement came from the Dreamers, with the acquisition of Wu Yong-sheng, a point guard at the Chinese Taipei national team level. Wu's signing addresses the previous season's issue of relying on frontcourt players to handle the ball. With coach Xu's leadership, Wu Yong-sheng is expected to quickly integrate into the team and achieve excellent results.</p> <p>The Best Head Coach: When talking about the Fubon Warriors, one cannot overlook their coach, Xu Jin-zhe, known as the best head coach in the world.</p> <p>Coach Xu Jin-zhe's tactics and player management skills are top-notch. He possesses a keen understanding of the game and excellent personnel deployment. In the previous season's championship series, he perfectly demonstrated his coaching abilities. He utilized different players in different situations and ensured that they all performed well. This is the strength of Coach Xu Jin-zhe, the best head coach in the world.</p> <p>The Only Concern: The only concern for the Fubon Warriors is injuries. It is undeniable that as players age, they become more prone to injuries. This is a common occurrence.</p> <p>The Warriors may also face this issue. While their overall team strength is exceptional with almost no weaknesses, injuries are the only potential threat to their success. As long as the Fubon Warriors can protect their players from excessive fatigue and maintain their physical condition by rotating players, they have a great chance of winning a fourth consecutive championship.</p>"},{"location":"20230914093912442633/","title":"The 2023 NBA Draft took place at the Barclays Center in New York yesterday","text":"<p>The 2023 NBA Draft took place at the Barclays Center in New York yesterday. The top three picks each had their own unique characteristics. Victor Wembanyama, also known as the \"French Monster,\" lived up to expectations by being selected as the first overall pick by the San Antonio Spurs. Standing at 7 feet 5 inches (226 cm) tall with an 8-foot wingspan (243 cm), Wembanyama's physical attributes make him a highly coveted prospect. Additionally, he possesses the shooting ability of a guard and the mobility of a forward, making him the undisputed top choice for the draft.</p> <p>Wembanyama becomes the third number one pick in Spurs history, following in the footsteps of David Robinson in 1987 and Tim Duncan in 1997. Both of these legendary centers helped the Spurs win NBA championships.</p> <p>Now, the responsibility falls on Wembanyama's shoulders. The Spurs have won the NBA championship five times in their history, with the most recent one coming in the 2013-14 season. In light of Wembanyama's arrival, the Spurs have decided to extend the contract of their 74-year-old legendary head coach, Gregg Popovich, for another three years. They hope to rely on his experience coaching French stars like Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to help Wembanyama adapt quickly to the intensity and lifestyle of the NBA.</p> <p>After being selected as the top pick, Wembanyama couldn't help but shed tears of joy. In an interview with ESPN, he said, \"When I heard the NBA commissioner announce my name, it felt like my lifelong dream was coming true. I've dreamt about this moment so many times, which is why I cried.\"</p> <p>The second overall pick, Brandon Miller, stands at 6 feet 9 inches (205 cm) tall and possesses elite 3D physical attributes. He is the only player among the top three picks who played college basketball in the United States. Although he was chosen by the Charlotte Hornets, ESPN reported that during his tryout with the Hornets, Miller told the team owner and basketball legend Michael Jordan that Jordan wasn't his idol, and he hadn't watched much of Jordan's games. Miller's journey to becoming the second pick was filled with twists and turns. Just a year ago, he was projected to be a second-round pick or even go undrafted. However, Miller improved his skills and played for the University of Alabama, where he became a top seed in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. This propelled Miller's draft stock into the lottery range.</p> <p>However, in February of this year, Miller was unexpectedly involved in a shooting incident with a college teammate. Although he was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, it nearly jeopardized his basketball career.</p> <p>At just 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) tall, Jaden Hudson had a good chance of being this year's top pick if not for Wembanyama.

The Fukushima region has been associated with tragic events such as nuclear power and earthquake tsunamis, giving it the reputation of a \"city of sorrow.\" Despite the challenges faced in the region's overall industrial innovation and development, the local citizens have always shown passionate support for sports and its growth. With a professional baseball, soccer, and basketball team, Fukushima aims to reshape the external perception through sports.</p> <p>Fukushima Commercial High School's boys' basketball team was born in this environment and spirit. In 2003, the team was established under the leadership of Coach Shinya Mizuno. Coach Mizuno, known for his defensive-oriented style of play, is not only the head coach of the Japanese U18 high school boys' basketball team for the 31st Japan-China-Korea Youth Basketball Exchange Tournament, but also led Fukushima Commercial High School to three national high school basketball tournaments between 2003 and 2013, achieving their best ranking of 32nd. Coach Mizuno is currently the head coach of the Japanese U19 boys' basketball team.</p> <p>In 2021, Coach Mizuno returned to coach the boys' basketball team at Fukushima Commercial High School, bringing expectations for a new era for the team. In just over three years, the school has already established itself as a powerhouse in high school basketball, reaching the finals of the newcomer championship and advancing to the top four. Despite not being able to recruit foreign players to strengthen the overall team's competitiveness due to the Japanese public school system, the focus in Japan's basketball community is now on cultivating more local players.</p> <p>Fukushima Commercial High School actively challenges higher stages starting from local competitions. After participating in the Japan-China-Korea Youth Basketball Exchange Tournament at the end of August, Coach Mizuno will lead the team to Taiwan for the Chang Yao Cup. This tournament will serve as important preparation for the Winter Cup in November. Coach Mizuno stated, \"Being able to compete and exchange with players of the same age from different countries is a valuable opportunity for us.\" Through international competition, the team aims to broaden their players' perspectives and improve their skills.

However, little-known is the secret behind the Grizzlies' home court internet and communication equipment.</p> <p>The tale of misery and resilience of the Memphis Grizzlies began in 1995 when the team was established in Vancouver, Canada.</p> <p>Compared to the Toronto Raptors, who also entered the league from Canada around the same time, the Grizzlies were considered soft and struggled with their dismal performance. The combination of poor records and being located on the fringes led the management to relocate the team to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001.</p> <p>During their six seasons in Vancouver, the Grizzlies achieved a woeful record of 101 wins and 359 losses, with a winning percentage of only 22%. Please continue reading below. </p> <p>In their first year after the move, the team underwent a transformation. They not only relocated to the warm and pleasant South but also acquired Spanish power forward Pau Gasol as the 3rd overall pick in the draft.</p> <p>Gasol, who was selected as the Rookie of the Year with averages of 17.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 2.7 assists, undoubtedly became the cornerstone of the Grizzlies. Despite Gasol's impressive performance, the team struggled in the playoffs, facing tough opponents such as the Spurs, Suns, and Mavericks in consecutive years. The inexperienced Grizzlies failed to secure a single victory in the playoffs, ending with a record of 0 wins and 12 losses. The team found themselves in a predicament of being unable to progress further, compounded by Gasol's injuries. As a result, Gasol was traded to the Lakers in the middle of the 2008 season for a rebuilding effort, and his younger brother Marc Gasol was included in the trade. When Marc arrived at the team as a second-round rookie before the 08-09 season, he was relatively unknown. However, no one expected him to join forces with young point guard Mike Conley, who was selected the previous year, as well as the disgruntled forward Zach Randolph, to transform the Grizzlies into a force to be reckoned with in the Western Conference.</p> <p>Photo Credit: AP / Getty Images / In the NBA Summer League game in Las Vegas on July 15th, the Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves.</p> <p>Since creating the \"Legend of the 8th Seed\" by defeating the top-seeded Spurs in 2011, the Grizzlies have become a formidable obstacle in the Western Conference. They have made the playoffs for seven consecutive years, although they have never advanced to the Western Conference Finals. However, teams such as the Spurs, Warriors, and Thunder, who are regular participants in the conference finals, often have to overcome the hurdle of the Grizzlies. Just like the blue-collar atmosphere of Memphis, the Grizzlies' playing style has remained consistently aggressive, resilient, and tenacious.</p> <p>Despite being in a small market, the Grizzlies' tough and caring image has strengthened the bond between the team and local fans, especially with key players Conley and Randolph being fan favorites.</p> <p>Both players are actively involved in community service and have been recognized with the NBA Cares Community Assist Award (Conley has even won it twice). With such close interaction between the team's core players and local residents, it is not difficult to imagine the Grizzlies' position in Memphis.</p> <p>As the only major professional sports team in Memphis, the franchise is dedicated to community engagement. In addition to actively participating in local education, youth development, health, and fitness initiatives, the team is committed to enhancing the fan experience.</p> <p>Since current owner Robert Pera acquired the team in 2012, his parent company Ubiquiti Inc. has provided technical assistance to ensure that fans can enjoy uninterrupted internet access while watching games.

However, accessing the internet inside enclosed arenas is not as straightforward as one might think. The size and design of the venue can cause signal interference, and the crowded audience absorbs a significant amount of radio frequency, making signal transmission difficult. In addition, the rapid movement of crowds during popular events poses a challenge for arenas to meet all the networking needs, from near emptiness to a packed house.</p> <p>This phenomenon is commonly observed at most indoor sports events, concerts, and large-scale music performances.</p> <p>The aforementioned challenges have also occurred at the Grizzlies' home court, FedEx Forum.

Not only does he show great skills in both offense and defense, but he also possesses a dominating presence on the court, once again proving his nickname as the \"God of War.\" Benefiting from the opportunities he gained last year due to injuries within the team, he displayed explosive offensive energy that was difficult for opponents to resist. With his agility, decisive positioning, and shooting ability, his future looks promising.</p> <p>Please continue reading \u25bc Although he did not win a championship, it is undoubtedly the biggest regret for Zhixuan Qiu. Whether it was in Dongshan High School, Yishou University, or the professional league, he has always been unable to personally touch the championship trophy. He earned the nickname \"Dongshan God of War\" in the HBL, leading his team to the top four and achieving the best record in team history. After studying at a university in the United States, he returned to Taiwan and joined Yishou University in 2020. With his impressive performance, he decided to challenge the professional league boldly.</p> <p>In the second season of the T1 League draft, he was selected in the first round by the Kaohsiung Family Mart Sea God team, allowing him to stay in the familiar environment of southern Taiwan and reunite with his college coach, Yujuan Xie.</p> <p>The head coach of the Sea God, Brendan Joyce, is not afraid to use rookies, so Zhixuan Qiu quickly became a key player coming off the bench. His versatile offensive skills and speed make him the focal point of the team's change of pace. In the game against the Yunbao team on December 4, he scored an astonishing 31 points, 3 rebounds, 4 assists, and 2 steals in just 27 minutes, displaying sharp and accurate attacks without fear even when facing foreign players. In the second half of the season, the team's frontline suffered from injuries, providing him with the opportunity to showcase his talents. He did not disappoint, although his shooting percentage needs improvement, he solidly contributed points and became a key player in changing the team's momentum. Throughout the season, he averaged nearly 20 minutes per game, with 7.7 points, 3 rebounds, and 1.2 assists, making him the only competitor to Wei-Jia Gu in the Rookie of the Year race.</p> <p>Of course, for the Sea God team defending their title, they faced many challenges and were eliminated in the first round by the Hawks. However, nurturing future star Zhixuan Qiu has made the team's frontline strength even stronger, and Lin Renhong and Wu Xiaojin will no longer be isolated. He, along with Su Wenru and Lu Weiting, were selected to represent Taiwan in this year's World University Games, and all three of them performed well. With their ability to score inside and outside, although they are not as tall as their opponents, they can become pillars of the Chinese national team and grow through exchanges with top players from around the world.</p> <p>Please continue reading \u25bc As seen from the perspective of the author, Zhixuan Qiu is one of the most consistent players, apart from Ai-Zhe You and Jinwei Gao. He was set as a starting player from the beginning. Except for the games against Lithuania and Japan, he scored in double digits in all other games. In the game against China, he frequently tore through the defense, grabbed 9 rebounds, and punished opponents in one-on-one situations. In the ranking matches against South Africa and Poland, his performance as a corner three-point shooter was outstanding, making it difficult for opponents to defend against both inside and outside attacks. In addition, his defense is also impressive. Even though his skills may not be sufficient, he compensates with his determination. He performs well in the areas of wide zones, the second and third zones, and individual defense. He had 11 steals in 6 games, leading to several fast breaks, accurately showcasing Coach Mengzhu Liu's fast-paced style.</p> <p>Zhixuan Qiu averaged 10.6 points, 3 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 1.8 steals per game. His playing time increased with each game, highlighting his importance. Although he is only 190 cm tall and may not have any advantages against European and American powerhouses, his sharp and fearless shooting makes him the first player to break through limitations for the Chinese national team. Together with You and Gao, they constantly disrupt the opponent's defense with their cutting, providing crucial speed and impact, just like in their professional league encounters.</p> <p>Seeing his performance reminds me of Lin Zhijie in the early stages of his career. They have a similar height but exude a dominating presence on the court. They both have a fearless attitude in both offense and defense, which is the courage that young players should have, truly deserving the title of \"God of War.\" In terms of offense, his shooting mechanism is stable, his three-point shooting is accurate, and he is selective and composed in his shot choices. His understanding of tactics and positioning inherits the characteristics of players produced by Yida, making him a player with a team-oriented style. He has speed when cutting and a soft touch when finishing at the rim. Although his main attacking method is facing the basket, he has enough energy and agility. Of course, young players still need to put in the effort. Once caught in a double-team or on the sideline, mistakes are likely to occur. His ball-handling skills need improvement, but his offensive and defensive awareness and execution are impressive, making him a reliable player.</p> <p>\u25bc \"Holding the ball\" as a future lesson, let the God of War dominate the court. Zhixuan Qiu is actually a player with a good shooting touch. It wouldn't be a bad option for him to transition to shooting guard or focus on shooting. However, he did not choose this path and instead became a versatile forward. Although his movements and finesse still need improvement, I believe this is the key to finding a unique position for him in the future. Moreover, all professional teams lack forwards who can attack with the ball. Most of them need guards or centers to receive or pass the ball to score. If he can develop diverse offensive skills, he could become one of the players who can provide firepower for the frontline.</p>"},{"location":"20230915091400800029/","title":"Video: NBA Talk on Player Discipline Requirements - Cuban Traded Players for Excessive Drug Use","text":"<p>Mark Cuban   Video: NBA Talk on Player Discipline Requirements - Cuban Traded Players for Excessive Drug Use</p> <p>Mark Cuban.

With a 4-1 victory in the championship series, the Nuggets claimed their first-ever NBA title in franchise history. The 7-game series, played in the United States, followed a 4-win format. The Nuggets returned to their home court with a 3-1 advantage and secured the championship against the Miami Heat.</p> <p>Tyler Herro, who averaged 20.1 points per game for the Heat and was their second-leading scorer, suffered a right hand fracture and underwent surgery after the first playoff game against the Milwaukee Bucks.

However, the Heat's overall rebounding disadvantage, with 50 rebounds compared to the Nuggets' 71, proved to be a significant factor.</p> <p>Looking back at the Nuggets' history, they went through a 5-year dark rebuilding period before Jokic, Murray, and coach Malone led them to become the second team to win an NBA championship after the ABA-NBA merger. The American Basketball Association (ABA), founded in 1967, and the National Basketball Association (NBA), founded in 1946, were in competition until the ABA merged with the NBA in 1976. Only four ABA teams remained in the NBA, including the Nuggets, Brooklyn Nets, Indiana Pacers, and San Antonio Spurs.</p> <p>The Nuggets have consistently made it to the playoffs, both in the ABA and NBA. In the ABA, they made the playoffs in all nine seasons but reached the Finals only once. After joining the NBA, the Nuggets made the playoffs nine times in the 1980s and had a ten-season playoff streak from 2004 to 2013. However, they never won a championship. Despite a five-year rebuilding period starting in the 2013-14 season, the Nuggets quietly laid the foundation for their success.</p> <p>The acquisition of Jokic in 2014, Murray in 2016, and Porter Jr. in 2018, along with the hiring of Malone as coach in 2015, finally paid off in the 2018-19 season when they finished with a 54-28 record, securing the second seed in the Western Conference.</p> <p>Throughout their 47-year history, the Nuggets have had many notable players, including Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, and Carmelo Anthony. With coach George Karl, known for his offensive style, the Nuggets played an exciting brand of basketball in the early 2000s, known for their high-scoring games.</p> <p>Since moving to the Pepsi Center in 1999, the Nuggets' home court advantage has been attributed to the high altitude of Denver, which sits at 5,280 feet above sea level. Jokic, who was initially overweight when he entered the NBA, transformed himself into a dominant force on the court after adopting a healthier lifestyle and shedding excess weight. He has now earned the title of MVP.</p> <p>Jokic, a 28-year-old Serbian center, was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft with the 41st overall pick. He had an outstanding performance from the beginning of his NBA career, earning a spot on the All-Rookie First Team. Despite his initially heavier build compared to other players, Jokic's scoring and rebounding averages have steadily increased over the years, reaching 20.1 points and 10.8 rebounds per game in the 2019-20 season, with a slight decline in the following season.</p>"},{"location":"20230915091446552002/","title":"The 2023 World Cup: The Failure of Team USA, Not NBA","text":"<p>The 2023 World Cup came to a close with Germany defeating Serbia in the championship game, securing a perfect record of eight wins and claiming the title    The 2023 World Cup: The Failure of Team USA, Not NBA</p> <p>The 2023 World Cup came to a close with Germany defeating Serbia in the championship game, securing a perfect record of eight wins and claiming the title.

Both teams will be present at the 2024 Olympics. The final eight teams in the Tokyo Olympics were Italy, France, Slovenia, Germany, the United States, Spain, Australia, and Argentina, with only four of them making it to the quarterfinals of this World Cup.</p> <p>This demonstrates that the gap between countries in FIBA is very narrow, and any slight mistake can lead to elimination. Every country is cautious and fearful in such top-tier competitions. Despite having the most NBA players, the United States and Canada, who have the second-highest number, only met in the third-place game, indicating that having NBA players is no longer a guarantee of victory.</p> <p>However, looking at the awards of this tournament, all the players in the First Team were from the NBA, and three players in the Second Team are currently playing in the NBA, with only Arturs Zagars from Latvia and Nikola Milutinov from Serbia not in the NBA.</p> <p>The Best Defensive Player, Dillon Brooks, and the Rising Star, Josh Giddey, are also current NBA players. Before the quarterfinals of the knockout stage, FIBA's official website released the second phase of the World Cup MVP rankings, with Luka Doncic at the top, followed by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Anthony Edwards, and Dennis Schroder. Arturs Zagars was the only player in the top five who is not currently playing in the NBA. Moving forward, let's continue reading about the disappointment of Team USA in this World Cup, but not the NBA league as a whole.</p> <p>The NBA remains the most talented and competitive basketball league in the world and can be rightly called the pinnacle of basketball.</p> <p>Considering the huge revenue gap between the NBA and European basketball leagues, it is unlikely that the NBA's dominance will change in the short term, leaving other basketball leagues far behind. The United States has suffered two consecutive World Cup defeats, and the main reason behind this is the increasing internationalization of the NBA.</p> <p>Over a quarter of NBA players come from various countries worldwide, and while internationalization helps in developing the market, it also increases the strength of basketball in different countries.</p> <p>In the NBA, the mainstream requires big men to be able to shoot and create space, set screens, execute handoffs, and provide high-level playmaking. Defensively, the focus is on switching, covering a large area, and disrupting opponents.</p> <p>American big men are becoming less skilled in traditional tasks such as rebounding and positioning. Whether it's a problem with player selection or Steve Kerr's bias, the scarcity of American big men who fit the international trend, coupled with the absence of unique players like Draymond Green, has led to the inefficiency of using a small-ball lineup without a traditional center like Paolo Banchero. Having NBA stars is no longer a guarantee of victory, as it is a fact that winning in FIBA games requires team play.</p> <p>The United States persists in training methods that go against the mainstream, and the result of hastily assembling a team is a performance similar to the top teams in FIBA. Moving on, in the first round, they faced Greece, followed by Montenegro and Lithuania in the second round. In the knockout stage, they faced Italy and Germany. Out of the five games against European countries, the United States won three and lost two.</p> <p>The semifinal against Germany was a classic encounter, with the Germans displaying no fear of the United States' physical advantage in a fast-paced game. They competed fiercely and emerged as winners, proving that European teams can defeat the United States without relying on dominance in the paint or controlling the pace of the game. Although Team USA was not at its best in this tournament, even with a stronger roster, there is no guarantee of ultimate success.</p> <p>In the previous World Cup, Team USA had the worst performance in history, and the late legendary player Kobe Bryant stated in an interview that it is not easy for the United States to win on the world stage, as the era of the 1992 Barcelona Dream Team has passed. After the third-place game, head coach Kerr admitted his failure, saying, \"Every year, players come and go, making it difficult for the United States to establish continuity. The NBA is very different from FIBA, and we must study and relearn how to win FIBA games.\"</p> <p>Basketball has globalized over the past 30 years, and teams from various countries have become stronger. Winning the World Cup or the Olympics is not an easy task.</p> <p>The decline of American-born superstars is also a contributing factor. In recent years, the MVP recipients have all been foreign-born players, with the last American-born player to win the award being James Harden in the 2017-18 season while playing for the Houston Rockets.</p> <p>Sending immature players to compete in FIBA games has exposed their weaknesses. For example, this time, Anthony Edwards, who scored the most points, possesses explosiveness and a good touch, but he lacks the ability to draw defensive attention and create space for his teammates. The lack of skilled big men for screens is a problem, but after setting a screen, Edwards can only create scoring opportunities for himself, and he struggles to read the overall defense, failing to stretch the opponents' defensive line.</p>"},{"location":"20230915091524196581/","title":"Luka Doncic's performance in the FIBA World Cup: Lithuania defeats Slovenia with a large margin","text":"<p>Slovenia was defeated by Lithuania in the 5-8 ranking match    Luka Doncic's performance in the FIBA World Cup: Lithuania defeats Slovenia with a large margin</p> <p>Slovenia was defeated by Lithuania in the 5-8 ranking match.</p> <p>In another match of the FIBA World Cup 5-8 ranking game, Lithuania faced Slovenia.

In the final moments, Lithuania's Mindaugas Kuzminskas made a difficult three-pointer, giving Lithuania a 75-63 lead entering the last quarter.</p> <p>In the final quarter, Margiris Normatas and Mindaugas Kuzminskas fired from the outside, combined with Jonas Valanciunas' inside presence, expanding Lithuania's lead to 18 points. Slovenia managed to score with a three-pointer from Gregor Glas, but Lithuania quickly extended their lead to over 20 points. In the end, Slovenia's pursuit was in vain as Lithuania defeated them 100-84. Lithuania will compete against Latvia for the fifth place on Saturday.

Led by Nikola Jokic's 28 points and 16 rebounds, along with Michael Porter Jr.'s 16 points and 13 rebounds, the Nuggets staged a comeback in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. With a 4-1 series win, the Nuggets fulfilled their goal of winning their first NBA championship in franchise history.</p> <p>In the best-of-seven NBA Finals, the Nuggets returned to their home court with a 3-1 advantage over the Miami Heat. Despite the Heat taking an early 5-0 lead, the Nuggets responded with a 12-0 run to establish their presence. The Heat, led by Bam Adebayo's 18 points, managed to take a 24-22 lead at the end of the first quarter.</p> <p>The Nuggets struggled with their three-point shooting in the first half, making only 1 out of 15 attempts. With Adebayo's strong performance, the Heat maintained a 51-44 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, Jamal Murray's three-pointer tied the game at 60-60.</p> <p>Both teams battled back and forth, with Michael Porter Jr.'s three-pointer giving the Nuggets a lead, countered by Kyle Lowry's three-pointer for the Heat to reclaim the advantage.

However, the Heat, led by Jimmy Butler's five consecutive points, regained the lead. With 27 seconds left in the game, the Heat trailed 89-90. Unfortunately, they committed a crucial turnover, allowing the Nuggets to secure the victory with four successful free throws.

Nikola Jokic contributed 28 points and 16 rebounds, while Michael Porter Jr. added 16 points and 13 rebounds. Jamal Murray had 14 points and 8 assists. For the Heat, Jimmy Butler scored a team-high 21 points, and Bam Adebayo recorded 20 points and 12 rebounds. However, the Heat's overall rebounding disadvantage of 50-71 proved to be a significant factor in their defeat.</p> <p>Looking back at the Nuggets' history, the team went through a five-year rebuilding phase before finding success with Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray, and coach Michael Malone. The Nuggets became the second team from the ABA (American Basketball Association) to win an NBA championship after the league merged with the NBA in 1976.</p> <p>Founded in 1967 as one of the original ABA teams, the Nuggets initially went by the names Larks and Rockets before adopting the Nuggets name in 1974. They made it to the ABA Finals in their last season before the merger but lost to the New York Nets. Throughout their history, the Nuggets have had various notable players, including Alex English, Dikembe Mutombo, and Carmelo Anthony. Under coach George Karl's offensive-minded system, the Nuggets became known for their fast-paced style of play.</p> <p>The Nuggets' home arena, the Pepsi Center, is located at an elevation of 5,280 feet. This high-altitude environment has earned the Nuggets a reputation for having a significant home-court advantage. Despite initially appearing overweight, Nikola Jokic transformed his physique and became an MVP-caliber player after giving up his soda-drinking habit.</p> <p>Nikola Jokic, a 28-year-old Serbian center, was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the 2014 NBA Draft with the 41st overall pick. He quickly made a name for himself in the NBA and was named to the All-Rookie First Team. Over the years, Jokic's scoring average and rebounding numbers steadily increased. In the 2019-20 season, he averaged 19.9 points and 9.7 rebounds per game.</p>"},{"location":"20230916091205750990/","title":"The Blurred Pros and Cons of the 2023 World Cup: The United States is Ultimately Just a Strong Team, Not an Invincible Powerhouse","text":"<p>Certainly, before the game against Lithuania, the United States team had already secured a top-two spot in Group J of the second round, advancing to the quarterfinals, and had even secured a spot in next year's Paris Olympics   The Blurred Pros and Cons of the 2023 World Cup: The United States is Ultimately Just a Strong Team, Not an Invincible Powerhouse</p> <p>Certainly, before the game against Lithuania, the United States team had already secured a top-two spot in Group J of the second round, advancing to the quarterfinals, and had even secured a spot in next year's Paris Olympics. However, by the standards set by the United States in various fields, they are still considered to be the favored side to win as the world's number one basketball powerhouse.</p> <p>But Lithuania refused to accept defeat, or rather, they once again put the United States in a situation where they fell behind at the start of the game. Unlike the United States' previous five opponents in the World Cup, Lithuania only allowed the United States to lead for 1 minute and 18 seconds within the first two minutes of the game. Even though the United States team made a strong comeback in the second half, Lithuania did not allow them to make any progress and ultimately won the game 110-104, handing the United States their first loss in the World Cup.</p> <p>Since the 2016 Rio Olympics, the United States has been unable to maintain a perfect record in their recent three international competitions. Please continue reading. </p> <p>Of course, we cannot deny that Lithuania was incredibly accurate in this game. They were, in fact, the most accurate outside shooting team in the World Cup thus far. Not only did they make 6 out of 6 three-pointers in the first quarter and all 9 attempts before the start of the game, but also 14 of Lithuania's three-pointers came from 9 different players, including their main center Jonas Valanciunas. All 11 players who entered the game took shots from beyond the three-point line. Even when Anthony Edwards was closely defended by Mindaugas Kuzminskas with less than 3 minutes and 52 seconds left in the fourth quarter, he still made a difficult three-pointer. And with 1 minute and 43 seconds remaining, Tomas Dimsa successfully made another three-pointer, extending the lead to 11 points. These two three-pointers dealt a heavy blow to the United States. Despite having almost flawless defense, the United States still couldn't stop Lithuania's seemingly destined shots, ultimately making their comeback efforts in vain. Only focusing on three-pointers would be ignoring Lithuania's true strength. Jonas Valanciunas, a center, has faced challenges from one ball-handling core after another in the NBA due to his vulnerability in high pick-and-roll defense. However, under FIBA rules that allow zone defense and dominant play in the paint by centers, Valanciunas has become a powerful and versatile low-post scorer. With the long-term cohesion and basketball IQ of the national team, he is truly a dominant center under FIBA rules. Like Nikola Vucevic, the main center for Montenegro in the previous game against the United States, both players have showcased their talents on the FIBA court, allowing the world to see the brilliance of European star centers. Additionally, Lithuania's tallest player is 6 feet 4 inches, and all their guards are strong defenders. The inside players, including Valanciunas, provide solid screens and tough defense. Lithuania's team consensus to play tough games, active off-ball movement, and preparedness for both offense and defense make them a feared powerhouse on the world stage. Please continue reading.</p> <p>This was fully reflected in their competition against the United States. Of course, the incredible three-point shooting in the first quarter was the key to their early lead. However, Lithuania's biggest victory in the game was their aggressive style of play, which allowed them to establish an early advantage in rebounds and off-ball crashes. Except for Jaren Jackson Jr. and the strong Edwards, the other three starters for the United States were at a disadvantage in their matchups against Lithuania. Even with Tyrese Haliburton and Brandon Ingram, who have relatively better physical attributes in the second unit, Lithuania still managed to find Austin Reaves through team screens. Lithuania outrebounded the United States 43 to 27 and had a 17-2 advantage in second-chance points. For example, at the end of the third quarter, Kuzminskas grabbed an offensive rebound and scored, maintaining a safe distance from the United States' second unit. Fortunately, Lithuania had accumulated enough second-unit attacks in the first three quarters to maintain their lead. Otherwise, if Lithuania had only grabbed one offensive rebound in the fourth quarter and allowed the United States to score, the comeback attempt could have been successful. As for the United States, in the preliminary rounds, they replaced Ingram, who was in a slump, with Josh Hart in the starting lineup to pair with Mikal Bridges and Jalen Brunson, both champions from Villanova. However, this starting lineup was a clear \"one big, four small\" lineup, which means that only Edwards was the main offensive threat. Bridges and Hart, who are considered \"functional wing players\" with some offensive explosiveness, or Bridges' offensive breakout after joining the Brooklyn Nets, may make them look more than just functional players. However, fundamentally, they are not like Valanciunas, who can dismantle opponents' defenses in the low post with force or superstars like Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, or at least Dwyane Wade, who can score in high-level games. Indeed, from the composition of the United States' starting lineup or the entire team's selection, we can see that the United States has many outstanding functional players. However, in this game against Lithuania, the weaknesses of this lineup became evident.</p>"},{"location":"20230916091248578782/","title":"The Player's Union declined to participate in the cross-league invitation tournament organized by the Chinese Basketball Association (referred to as CBA) for the 2023 Asian Games Men's Basketball Team","text":"<p>The Player's Union declined to participate in the cross-league invitation tournament organized by the Chinese Basketball Association (referred to as CBA) for the 2023 Asian Games Men's Basketball Team.

The situations for the two players are slightly different. Harden publicly accused the team's general manager, Daryl Morey, of being a fraud during his trip to Shanghai in the offseason, and stated that he would no longer work with Morey. More details can be found in the previous article by the author.</p> <p>Next step of \"The Process\" - Exploring the future of the Philadelphia 76ers, please continue reading. Damian Lillard (Image Source: AP Photo) On the other hand, Lillard is a contrast to the trend of star players forming alliances. Lillard has always been the face of the Portland Trail Blazers and the hope of the fans, especially after the careers of Greg Oden and Brandon Roy were ruined by injuries. The team has built around Lillard as the core, bringing in many supporting players. For example, the year after Lillard was drafted, CJ McCollum was also drafted, forming one of the most powerful backcourt duos in addition to the Splash Brothers. In subsequent years, the team acquired Jusuf Nurkic from the Denver Nuggets in 2018 to become their starting center, and traded for Josh Hart and Jerami Grant from the Detroit Pistons in 2022 to improve their backcourt defense. These actions demonstrate the Trail Blazers' determination to win a championship with their star player Lillard. Not only has the team made efforts, but Lillard himself has made game-winning shots in crucial moments, leading the team to victory. For example, in the sixth game of the first round in 2014, he hit a game-winning shot against the Houston Rockets, and in the fifth game of the first round in 2019, he hit a game-winning shot against Paul George, who was a contender for MVP that year, leading the team to the second round. Lillard has also played through injuries in recent years, often struggling to sleep at night due to the pain. This proves Lillard's abilities and loyalty. However, after several years of losses and the selection of talented young guards Shaedon Sharpe and Scoot Henderson in the past two years, the Trail Blazers seem to be indirectly telling Lillard that there is no longer a place for him in their new era. This has led Lillard to indirectly express his desire to be traded.</p> <p>Next, let's discuss the trade value of these two players and where they might go. First, let's talk about James Harden. Harden is currently 34 years old and his salary is around $35 million. He will enter free agency next year, so trading him now would only give a team one year of his services. One of the reasons Harden may be so upset with Morey is likely because he couldn't get a max contract. For Harden, who will be 35 when the free agency market opens next year, he probably wants to secure one last big contract, especially considering the rumors that his former team, the Houston Rockets, is interested in bringing him back. Looking at the Rockets' salary situation in 2024-25, they are likely able to offer a contract that satisfies the former franchise star. Therefore, for teams that want to recruit Harden to contend for a championship, it will be a big gamble. In terms of his current performance, in the past two seasons, Harden has averaged 21 points, 6 rebounds, and 10.7 assists with the 76ers, and 22.5 points, 8 rebounds, and 10.2 assists with the Nets. These numbers have decreased compared to his average of 29.6 points during his time with the Rockets, but his assists have increased (he averaged around 7.7 assists with the Rockets). This is because Harden is no longer the primary ball handler on his current teams, the Nets and the 76ers. He is limited by declining athleticism and the league's crackdown on offensive fouls. These factors have reduced his desire to drive to the basket. Additionally, during his time with the Nets, he played alongside Kevin Durant, a dominant offensive player, and although the three stars rarely played together, Harden mostly served as the team's secondary ball handler, responsible for organizing the offense. This is also the case with the 76ers, who have a versatile offensive lineup with players like Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, Tobias Harris, PJ Tucker, and DeAnthony Melton. These factors make it easier for Harden, whose athleticism is declining, to play his game. The Los Angeles Clippers are currently the team most interested in recruiting Harden. However, in order to acquire him, the Clippers would likely have to give up rotation players like Norman Powell and Marcus Morris, as well as draft picks. Due to previous trades, the Clippers do not have any first-round picks until 2027. Considering this, I believe the 76ers would not be interested in acquiring this package for Harden unless they have no other options. Another possibility is the Houston Rockets, but after signing Fred VanVleet, a championship-winning guard from the Toronto Raptors, in free agency this year, the Rockets already have a backcourt rotation that includes VanVleet, Kevin Porter Jr., Jalen Green, Amen Thompson, and Cam Whitmore. Therefore, I think the most likely outcome is that Harden will stay with his current team next season.</p>"},{"location":"20230916091345038256/","title":"PLG Flying Apes and Zhou Yixiang sign extended contract, expected to be the cornerstone of the team","text":"<p>The Taoyuan Puyuan Flying Apes announced today (9/4) that they have signed a 3+2 (three-year contract with a two-year team option) extended contract with Zhou Yixiang    PLG Flying Apes and Zhou Yixiang sign extended contract, expected to be the cornerstone of the team</p> <p>The Taoyuan Puyuan Flying Apes announced today (9/4) that they have signed a 3+2 (three-year contract with a two-year team option) extended contract with Zhou Yixiang.

In this article, we will briefly discuss Ross' career and recent performances to highlight why he is still worth signing for any team.</p> <p>First, let's talk about Ross' potential as a young small forward. Ranked fifth among small forwards and thirtieth overall in the United States, Ross was considered a rising star in high school. He played for Jefferson High School in Portland, where he was selected as the 5A level Player of the Year and helped the team win the state championship alongside his teammate, Terrence Jones, who also went on to play in the NBA.</p> <p>After becoming a local celebrity, Ross attended the University of Washington. In his first year, he didn't have much playing time, averaging only 17.4 minutes per game with 8.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 1 assist. This highlighted his lack of refinement in certain skills and the challenges he faced when transitioning to a higher level. However, it was encouraging to see Ross shooting 35.2% from beyond the arc, indicating his potential as a shooter in the future.</p> <p>In his sophomore year, Ross transformed into a key player for the team. Compared to the previous year when he mainly came off the bench, Ross started every game and saw his playing time increase to an average of 31.1 minutes. He also doubled his scoring, averaging 16.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 1.4 assists. While his assist numbers didn't see much improvement, his immediate impact as a shooter and his exceptional athleticism kept him in the lottery range for the NBA draft. Eventually, Ross decided to forgo his remaining college eligibility and enter the 2012 NBA draft. Despite his underwhelming performance in his freshman year, his inclusion in the All-Pac-12 First Team, shooting 37.1% from beyond the arc, and ranking sixth in the conference in scoring proved his potential as a shooter. Combined with his fearless mentality in big games and his explosive scoring ability, which earned him the nickname \"The Human Torch,\" Ross was selected as the eighth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors.</p> <p>\"When I ask other guys who work out here, they say it's by far the best city in the league right now,\" Ross said. \"It's real diverse, a lot of people are friendly, I just love it out here.\"</p> <p>However, Ross' career did not live up to expectations. While he was considered a valuable bench player, his performance fell short of what was expected from an eighth overall pick. One reason was the issue of his position. With DeMar DeRozan occupying the starting position, Ross struggled to find his role on the team. Even when playing as a small forward, his size and subpar defense made the team vulnerable on defense.</p> <p>Another issue was Ross' playing style. Fans and the team hoped that as an athletic swingman selected in the lottery, Ross would become a two-way star. However, he failed to fully utilize his athleticism and his defensive contributions were not impressive. On offense, he often settled for outside shots and, due to his confidence in his abilities, opted for difficult shots instead of taking simpler options. Rather than being a star wing player, he became more of an outside shooting specialist. Consequently, the Raptors eventually traded him to the Orlando Magic. It's worth noting that Ross won the Slam Dunk Contest in 2013, showcasing his exceptional athleticism.</p> <p>After joining the Magic, Ross no longer carried the same expectations of a young prospect. He became a relied-upon mid-tier player on the team. Although he couldn't secure a starting role, his simple and effective playing style, combined with the Magic's lack of outside shooting, solidified his position on the team. He averaged 26.1 minutes per game over his seven years with the Magic, demonstrating his importance to the team.</p> <p>His familiar high-flying dunks were still present, and although his shooting from beyond the arc had some ups and downs, his ability to take decisive shots and handle pressure made him stand out on the team. Alongside Ross, the Magic made consecutive playoff appearances after a long drought, which speaks to his significant contributions to the team.</p>"},{"location":"20230916091443838332/","title":"The Miami Heat and the Portland Trail Blazers are expected to resume trade negotiations for Damian Lillard","text":"<p>The Miami Heat and the Portland Trail Blazers are expected to resume trade negotiations for Damian Lillard.

However, they are already old and prone to injuries, so it's hard to assess their chances. Reinforcement is necessary, especially in the restricted area and the large wing positions.</p> <p>Continuing reading, the two major weaknesses of the United States in this World Cup are rebounding and defense in the restricted area. In the consecutive games against Montenegro and Lithuania in the second round, the United States was dominated in rebounding, and the flaws of the center Jaren Jackson Jr. (JJJ) in defending the restricted area were exposed. Although JJJ is intimidating on defense, he is not good at facing low-post heavyweights, and his rebounding ability is insufficient for a power forward.</p> <p>In addition, JJJ easily gets into foul trouble in both the NBA and FIBA, resulting in a significant drop in the defensive intensity of the United States.</p> <p>Other players in the restricted area, such as Bobby Portis, lack shot-blocking ability and have a slim build. Paolo Banchero is better on offense than defense, lacks good defensive judgment, and has limited experience. Walker Kessler is too inexperienced and can block shots but struggles with defensive switches. Their offensive abilities also put the team at a disadvantage, as they often end up playing 4-on-5. All three of them have major question marks and cannot provide stable offense and defense in the restricted area. The United States' warm-up games clearly showed a significant drop in defensive performance when JJJ was not on the court. JJJ possesses the ability to shoot from the perimeter, protect the rim, and switch to the perimeter, making him irreplaceable. In the game against Lithuania, JJJ had two fouls in the first quarter, three fouls in the first half, and eventually fouled out after playing only 15 minutes. Although he had the best +/- value for the United States in the game, his limited playing time had limited impact.</p> <p>Continuing reading, the fastest solution would be to find a center who can dominate on both ends of the court, which leads to the consideration of Joel Embiid, a super center who holds both American and French nationality.</p> <p>However, it is unknown which country Embiid would choose to represent, and his injury-prone attribute raises concerns about his ability to play international games. Therefore, solving the problem in the restricted area becomes a top priority, once again highlighting the regret of Evan Mobley, the Cavaliers' power forward, not making the team. Mobley is young and has not played in a major international tournament, but he was named to the All-Defensive First Team for the 2022-23 season. Despite his slim build that limits his ability to defend centers for extended periods of time and his inconsistent shooting, his defense alone can make a significant impact.</p> <p>He can also help with high-level playmaking and fill the gap of not having a tactical center for the United States in this tournament. Besides Mobley, who else can the United States look for? Bam Adebayo, the starting center for the Miami Heat in the Tokyo Olympics, is the top candidate. Although his shot-blocking ability is not top-notch, his defensive range is extensive. He may not have the height, but his athleticism is exceptional, making him one of the best rim protectors who can execute switches in the paint.</p> <p>Adebayo will turn 27 next year, and there is a possibility that he will continue to represent the United States in the Paris Olympics. In the Tokyo Olympics, the United States also had Draymond Green, the former Defensive Player of the Year and a key player in the small-ball lineup of the Golden State Warriors. Even after Adebayo leaves the court, the United States can still maintain a certain level of defense and switching ability in the restricted area. In this World Cup, the United States lacks players with similar functions, not to mention the high-level playmaking, screening, and off-ball movement qualities that Adebayo and Green possess. </p> <p>If possible, Anthony Davis, who showcased his defensive prowess again in the 2023 playoffs, can significantly enhance the team's strength in the restricted area. When healthy, Davis is the best defender in the NBA, and even though his shooting can be inconsistent, he can still contribute on offense. He has also represented the national team in the past. However, his age and health factors make his participation uncertain.</p> <p>If we focus on young big men, Jarrett Allen, the center for the Cleveland Cavaliers, is a potential candidate. Allen represented the United States in the 2016 U18 Americas Championship but has not played for the national team since then. He can protect the rim, solidify rebounding, and has some resistance against speedy players when switching on defense. He can be considered one of the top centers.</p> <p>Offensively, his threat is mainly in the paint, and he lacks playmaking skills. However, his excellent screen-setting ability can make up for it. He will be 26 next year, which is considered his prime, and if given the opportunity, he could be of great help. If the goal is to find a traditional big man, Mitchell Robinson, the center for the New York Knicks, is a possible candidate. However, he is purely a paint presence, although he is good at shot-blocking and grabbing offensive rebounds, his ability to execute tactics is limited, and he may just be a decoration in the Kerr system. Would it be better to directly use Kevon Looney? In fact, the United States has limited options when it comes to big men, as most of the centers who excel in defense and high-level playmaking in the 2022-23 season are foreign players.</p> <p>Domantas Sabonis (Lithuania), Steven Adams (New Zealand), Deandre Ayton (The Bahamas), Jusuf Nurkic (Bosnia), and Ivica Zubac (Croatia), not to mention the current top center Nikola Jokic (Serbia). Therefore, besides traditional big men, the United States needs large wing players who can support the restricted area.</p>"},{"location":"20230916091541553884/","title":"Jeremy Lin, a former NBA player of Taiwanese descent, has officially announced that he will be joining the PLG Kaohsiung Steelers in Taiwan","text":"<p>Jeremy Lin, a former NBA player of Taiwanese descent, has officially announced that he will be joining the PLG Kaohsiung Steelers in Taiwan.

Even though Jamal Murray, who also participated in national team training, didn't end up playing in the World Cup, Canada was still considered one of the strongest teams with the potential to win the championship. Not only do they have a chance to bring home their first World Cup medal, but they also have their sights set on the upcoming Paris Olympics. It has been over 20 years since Canada last competed in the Olympics, and nearly 90 years since they won a medal. The future looks promising for Canada.</p> <p>However, starting from the warm-up matches three weeks ago, the team's weaknesses, including a lack of a ball handler, have become apparent. Despite winning all three games in the first round of the World Cup group stage, the issues persisted. In the first game of the second round on September 1st, they suffered a 65-69 defeat against Brazil, putting them in a precarious situation where one more loss would end their journey for the World Cup championship. Although Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) wasn't the main culprit for Canada's loss in this game (he scored the team-high 23 points on 8-of-18 shooting, and combined with the returning Dort's 17 points, they contributed 40 points with a 48% shooting percentage), the rest of the Canadian teammates only managed to score a total of 25 points with a 20% shooting percentage. Additionally, there were some questionable on-court decisions and actions from head coach Jordi Fernandez. It can be said that without SGA, Canada wouldn't have had a chance to contend until the final seconds. However, the most capable player should bear the most responsibility for the defeat and have the highest expectations for improvement.</p> <p>SGA is no exception to this. After the game against Brazil, head coach Fernandez publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with the performance of his players, specifically mentioning that SGA \"needs to not only score but also organize the team's offense, which he didn't do.\" Although Fernandez also pointed out Barrett, Olynyk, and Brooks for not fulfilling their respective roles, as a Thunder fan, I am naturally more concerned about the head coach's criticism of the team's best-performing player.</p> <p>Despite acknowledging the head coach's flaws, Fernandez's comments about SGA are not entirely wrong. SGA's performance in this World Cup hasn't been outstanding. He averaged 22.3 points (ranked 6th among all registered players), 7.3 rebounds (ranked 20th), and 4.8 assists (ranked 28th). His overall shooting percentage of 51.6% looks impressive, making him one of the brightest stars in this World Cup. It's true that SGA has been able to take control of the game in the third quarter, showcasing his scoring abilities even in international play where space is more limited. His crafty drives, changes of direction and speed, make it difficult for opponents to predict whether he will take a mid-range shot or continue attacking the basket, not to mention his consistent free-throw shooting. In simple terms, SGA, who can't be guarded in the NBA, remains difficult to guard in international play, and he is still reliable. However, upon closer examination of the games, there are some worrisome aspects: his overall shooting percentage of 51.6% is composed of a 61.4% shooting percentage from two-pointers and a 27.8% shooting percentage from three-pointers. The subpar shooting from beyond the arc, below 30%, is not something to be feared.</p> <p>In a situation where he mostly relies on himself to create offense, SGA, who is not known for his outside shooting and has a slightly slow shooting motion even with a one-motion shot, hasn't been ideal in terms of his three-point shooting quality and quantity. This scoring pattern only makes it easier for opponents to predict his intentions, resulting in increased chances of mistakes or failures. Although his 3.2:1 assist-to-turnover ratio is impressive, ranking 28th in average assists, one could argue that SGA is one of the worst point guards in this World Cup. It's not just Fernandez mentioning the fact that he had only 2 assists and 2 turnovers against Brazil (of course, the inability of his teammates to make shots is also a significant reason for the lack of assists). In fact, as a point guard, SGA has the ability, awareness, and willingness to pass, but he is a player who relies on the coach's system rather than having his own system. In a situation where the team hasn't had much time to build chemistry and the coaching staff hasn't designed many half-court offensive plays, Canada doesn't have another ball handler to rely on. While there are multiple wings who can handle the ball and receive passes, when it comes to organizing and initiating offense, it all falls on SGA, highlighting his deficiencies in that area. Furthermore, SGA's transitions and decisions between \"organizational mode\" and \"scoring mode\" still appear obvious and deliberate, sometimes giving viewers the impression that \"he won't attack the basket actively in this quarter\" or \"he won't pass for the next five minutes,\" which is too one-sided. These criticisms may be too demanding for SGA, as finding a balance between scoring and organizing is not easy, especially for someone with strong offensive abilities like him. Without a backcourt teammate like Josh Giddey, who can assist him in playmaking, SGA appears isolated in Canada's backcourt.</p>"},{"location":"20230917091419525708/","title":"The Weakest U","text":"<p>The Weakest U.S. Team in Chit-Chat History before the Bronze Medal Match</p> <p>Introduction Since the formation of the U.S. team for this World Cup, it has been labeled as the \"weakest U.S. team in history\" due to the absence of big-name players. From the bumpy start of the tournament to the first defeat in the second round, and finally missing out on the gold medal match, it seems to have validated this \"weakest\" label... Unfair Evaluation I must honestly say that it is extremely unfair to label any national team as the \"weakest in history\" for players who sacrifice their rest time to bring glory to their country. Take the U.S. men's basketball team in this World Cup as an example. It is undeniable that their members have relatively shallow experience, with the most notable achievement in the NBA being selected for the All-Star Game (okay, I know JJJ is the Defensive Player of the Year). Compared to players in the past who have won MVP or made it to the All-NBA teams, they do fall short in terms of star power, so it is understandable that they are not highly regarded by the outside world. However, they represent the dominant force in world basketball, the U.S. team, so they are burdened with excessive expectations... On one hand, people think they are weak, but on the other hand, they believe they should perform well; on one hand, they think they are weak, but they describe their losses as \"upsets.\" Doesn't this logic seem contradictory? This not only unfair to the U.S. team but also unfair to the teams that defeated them! The most important thing is, how do we define the \"weakest in history\"? Is it based on the players' experience? The number of defeats? Or their ranking? If it is based on player experience, would the outside world change their tune to \"heroes emerge from the younger generation\" if the U.S. team wins the gold medal today? In fact, during the 2010 World Championship and the 2014 World Cup, the U.S. team was also initially questioned for lacking star power. However, as the saying goes, winning cures all, and after winning the gold medal with a perfect record, the doubts turned into admiration... Source: Wikipedia, Free Sports If it is based on the number of defeats, the current U.S. team has lost two games (one in the second round and one in the knockout stage) without playing the bronze medal match. Here are a few numbers for everyone to consider: In the 2019 World Cup, the U.S. team lost two games (one in the knockout stage and one in the classification round); in the 2004 Olympics, they lost three games (two in the group stage and one in the knockout stage); in the 2002 World Championship, they lost three games (one in the second round, one in the knockout stage, and one in the classification round). If it is based on ranking, the best result for the U.S. team this time would be third place, the same as in the 2004 Olympics and the 2006 World Championship. Even if they unfortunately finish fourth, their performance would still be better than the sixth place in the 2002 World Championship and the seventh place in the 2019 World Cup. Therefore, I believe that the \"weakest U.S. team in history\" is nothing more than a sensational headline, lacking a strong argumentative basis. The Reality The United States is still the strongest basketball country in terms of strength, with the strongest professional basketball league and the most abundant pool of basketball talent. Setting aside player participation issues, theoretically, it would not be difficult to form three teams of equivalent strength to this representative team. However, international competitions emphasize teamwork, while most other national teams have been playing together since their youth teams, the U.S. team is different. Although the USA Basketball has been conducting national team training since the painful loss in the 2004 Olympics, the training and cohesion time is not as long as other countries. Not to mention the various factors such as players' unfamiliarity with FIBA rules and their adaptation to the referees' interpretations, which have led to the current U.S. team still being a strong team but no longer invincible. To dominate international basketball, in addition to strength, they may need a bit of luck. Future Expectations The day when people no longer think that the U.S. team's victory is a given and the U.S. team's defeat is no longer a news headline will be the true moment of equality in international basketball! As for the title that the media occasionally still uses to refer to the U.S. team: Dream Team, it is already outdated. Let it forever remain in the dream of 1992!

The league has also taken notice of this, and the NBA Competition Committee is expected to present a new proposal for handling rest rotation to the board for a vote on Wednesday.</p> <p>The main proposal is that teams will not be allowed to rest two or more (including two) star players during nationally televised games in the United States. Violating this rule will result in fines for the team, with a first offense resulting in a $100,000 fine, a second offense resulting in a $250,000 fine, and a third offense resulting in a $1 million fine. Of course, the league has defined \"star players\" as players who have been selected for the All-Star Game and All-NBA teams in the past three years. According to Wojnarowski's report, the league has provided five general principles for the detailed regulations.</p> <p>In addition, the league has also provided several conditions under which rest rotation is allowed, specifically for regular-season back-to-back games (excluding nationally televised games): 1. Players who turn 35 on opening day. 2. Players who have played over 34,000 minutes in their professional careers. 3. Players who have played over 1,000 regular-season and playoff games.</p> <p>The NBA has already set high salary increases for players in the new CBA, with more benefits and restrictions. It is required that players participate in at least 65 games in order to be eligible for individual awards. Implementing stricter rest rotation rules is undoubtedly aimed at ensuring that star players have more exposure opportunities on nationally televised stages, where more people are watching.</p>"},{"location":"20230918091151639023/","title":"Video World Cup Finals: Germany Defeats USA to Advance to Championship Game","text":"<p>In the second game of the FIBA World Cup semifinals, Germany faced off against the USA   Video World Cup Finals: Germany Defeats USA to Advance to Championship Game</p> <p>In the second game of the FIBA World Cup semifinals, Germany faced off against the USA. The winner would go on to compete against Serbia for the championship. Germany had an impressive offensive performance, scoring 113 points and ultimately holding off a comeback attempt by the USA to secure a victory and advance to the World Cup championship game. This marks the second consecutive World Cup where the USA has failed to clinch the title. </p> <p>From the start, Germany took control of the game, creating space on offense and keeping the ball moving, leading the USA to call a timeout. The USA quickly closed the gap after falling behind by 10 points early on (25-15). Unlike their previous game against Lithuania, the USA prevented Germany from pulling away and ended the first quarter trailing by only two points.</p> <p>Both teams continued their offensive prowess in the second quarter, with Mikal Bridges, Anthony Edwards, and Austin Reaves taking turns scoring for the USA. Germany displayed a balanced attack from both inside and outside, with Daniel Theis scoring 9 points in this quarter alone. The first half was a high-scoring affair, with Germany narrowly leading 60-59.</p> <p>In the second half, Theis continued his hot streak, scoring six consecutive points and forcing the USA to call another timeout.

The USA called their second timeout of the second half, leaving them with only one timeout remaining. After the timeout, Reaves made a three-pointer, and Edwards scored a three-pointer with an additional free throw, resulting in a 7-0 run for the USA and prompting Germany to call a timeout. The game intensified, with Reaves and Dennis Schroder each making two-point shots, bringing the score within three points. But with 1 minute and 14 seconds left, Obst made a crucial three-pointer. In the following possession, Isaac Bonga made a crucial block for Germany. Schroder then made a mid-range shot, extending Germany's lead to six points.</p> <p>With six points to make up in the final moments, Reaves scored a layup to bring the deficit down to four points. After Germany's inbound, Bonga committed an offensive foul, resulting in a turnover. Unfortunately, Edwards made a critical turnover, squandering the opportunity to narrow the gap by four points. Even though Reaves made a successful layup in the end, it was not enough. Germany defeated the USA 113-111, advancing to the World Cup championship game. Germany's starting lineup had an outstanding performance, with shooter Andreas Obst scoring a team-high 24 points, including four three-pointers, and recording 6 assists. Dennis Schroder contributed 17 points and 9 assists, while Daniel Theis had an efficient shooting performance, scoring 21 points on 10-of-15 shooting and grabbing 7 rebounds. Franz Wagner also had a strong game, scoring 22 points and grabbing 5 rebounds.</p> <p>The USA's loss can be attributed to their defense, as they allowed Germany to score 113 points.

Please continue reading.</p> <p>In the 2019 World Cup final, Argentina faced Spain, taking an early lead and never falling behind. However, Argentina's star player, Lu\u00eds Scola, had a lackluster performance in what turned out to be his final World Cup game. Spain ultimately won the championship with a 20-point lead. The script was different in this year's final, as Serbia never gave up despite a double-digit deficit in the third quarter. They even had a chance to tie the game with a three-point shot, but unfortunately missed. In the end, Germany's Dennis Schroder displayed his disruptive skills once again, driving to the basket and widening the lead to four points, sealing the victory.</p> <p>The first half of the game was a back-and-forth battle, with the score tied at 47. However, Serbia faced a significant disadvantage when their key defender, Ognjen Dobric, injured his ankle and couldn't return to the game. Serbia's depth was evident in the semi-finals against Canada, where they rotated ten players, with even the shortest playing time being close to ten minutes.</p> <p>With eight intense games in a short period, managing physical stamina was crucial. Dobric's absence, who possessed the qualities of defensive prowess, mobility, and height, left Serbia lacking in countering Germany's tall front line. Such a high-intensity game can make a significant difference with one player missing, especially considering Dobric's strong presence on the court. Please continue reading.</p> <p>A key moment occurred in the third quarter when Germany's head coach, Gordon Herbert, boldly utilized center Johannes Voigtmann to directly challenge Serbia's main center, Nikola Milutinov. This strategy proved effective as Serbia struggled with their inside attacks, allowing Germany to expand their perimeter defense and suppress Serbia's outside firepower.</p> <p>Serbia failed to score any three-pointers in the entire quarter, only managing 10 points, giving Germany a significant advantage.</p> <p>In the fourth quarter, Serbia attempted a comeback led by guard Aleksa Avramovic. While constantly chasing Schroder on defense, Avramovic made three crucial three-pointers and scored 16 points in the quarter, coming close to helping his team even the score.</p> <p>Serbia's ace guard, Bogdan Bogdanovic, was the main reason for their competitiveness in the first half. However, Germany's defensive strategy in the second half, focusing on double-teaming Bogdanovic, limited his impact. He only attempted two shots and made one basket in the entire second half. In addition to Bogdanovic, their second-leading scorer, center Milutinov, failed to make an impact in the second half, and N. Jovic only made one basket. Losing these three key scoring options rendered Serbia's comeback attempts ineffective.</p> <p>Please continue reading. </p> <p>Serbia had been the team with the fewest turnovers and allowed the fewest fast break points in the tournament, showcasing their excellent ball control and low scoring from turnovers. However, in the final against Germany, they were not as fortunate. Germany had a slight advantage in rebounds, and both teams had a similar three-point shooting percentage. The turning point came in the third quarter when Serbia committed 12 turnovers, with Germany capitalizing on 9 of them. Germany gained 19 points from turnovers, while Serbia only managed 12. In such a closely contested game, scoring from turnovers made the difference.</p> <p>Franz Wagner's shooting accuracy was not particularly impressive in this game. However, his height, agility, and ability to penetrate caused significant trouble for Serbia's defense, leading to numerous trips to the free-throw line.</p> <p>With 11 free-throw attempts, 4 offensive rebounds, and 3 steals, Wagner unexpectedly but deservedly became the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the championship game. Schroder's relentless drives to the basket throughout the game, along with his 10 free-throw attempts, added to the damage Germany inflicted on Serbia. Except for a poor shooting performance against Latvia, Schroder consistently provided stable offensive output for the team, with a maximum of 10 assists in a single game.</p> <p>He undoubtedly served as the backbone of Germany's backcourt, providing the most reliable ball handling and attacking options. His disruptive abilities were evident in both guarding against smaller opponents and facing off against bigger players. Ultimately, he was awarded the MVP of the tournament.

They hold records such as the most championship wins in the current Japan Winter Cup (24 times), the highest single-game score in the women's division (139 points), the most championship wins in the Inter-High basketball competition (25 times), and 22 championships in the National Sports Festival basketball competition for high schools, including a five-year winning streak from 1992 to 1996.</p> <p>One of their famous achievements is the legendary score of \"268:0\" against Toyake High School in the 2014 Inter-High Aichi Prefecture regional qualifiers. Ohka Gakuen, the stable powerhouse of Japanese high school women's basketball, has broken the stereotype of Asian basketball players having inferior physical attributes with their flexible and innovative playing style.

However, by the standards of the US in various fields, it is still believed that as the world's number one basketball powerhouse, the US team is definitely favored to win.</p> <p>But Lithuania refused to give up, or rather, they once again put the US in a situation of falling behind at the start of the game. In contrast to the previous five opponents of the US in this World Cup, Lithuania differs in that they only allowed the US to lead for 1 minute and 18 seconds within the first two minutes of the game. Even though the US team made a strong comeback in the second half, Lithuania did not allow the US to gain any advantage and ultimately won the game 110-104, ending the US team's undefeated streak in the World Cup and handing them their first loss of the tournament. Since the 2016 Rio Olympics, the US has been unable to maintain a perfect record in their last three international competitions.</p> <p>Please continue reading. Of course, we cannot deny that Lithuania was incredibly accurate in this game. They were already the most accurate outside shooting team in the World Cup so far, but today they not only made 6 out of 6 three-pointers in the first quarter, but also made 14 three-pointers throughout the game from 9 different players, including their starting center Jonas Valanciunas. All 11 players who played had attempts from beyond the arc. In the final 3 minutes and 52 seconds of the fourth quarter, Mindaugas Kuzminskas made a difficult three-pointer with Anthony Edwards defending closely, and with 1 minute and 43 seconds left, Tomas Dimsa successfully hit another three-pointer to extend the lead to 11 points. These two three-point shots dealt a heavy blow to the US. Strictly speaking, the US defense had almost no loopholes, but Lithuania seemed to have luck on their side and ultimately made it difficult for the US to catch up. Focusing only on three-point shots would be ignoring Lithuania's true strength. Center Jonas Valanciunas, due to his weakness in defending high pick-and-rolls in the NBA, has always been tested by NBA guards on various teams, including the New Orleans Pelicans or his previous teams. However, in FIBA rules that allow zone defense and allow centers to dominate inside the paint, Valanciunas, with his strong physique and versatile low-post offensive skills, combined with the chemistry and basketball IQ developed through long-term collaboration with the national team, is a dominant center in FIBA rules. Similar to the starting center for Montenegro in the previous game against the US, Nikola Vucevic, both players have shown their star power on the FIBA court. Lithuania's shortest player is 6 feet 4 inches, and all their guards are strong in terms of physicality. The post players, including Valanciunas, provide solid defense and strong rebounding. Every movement by Lithuania causes trouble for their opponents, even without any predetermined physical contact. The team has a consensus to play tough on the court, with shooters actively moving without the ball, and everyone is prepared to compete in offense, defense, and against their opponents. Even without the assistance of NBA star Domantas Sabonis, Lithuania is still a formidable force on the world stage.</p> <p>Please continue reading. This was fully reflected in their competition against the US in this game. Of course, the incredible three-point shooting in the first quarter helped them quickly build a large lead. However, the key to Lithuania's victory in this game was the aggressive style of play mentioned earlier. They established an early advantage in rebounds and off-ball scrambles. Apart from Jaren Jackson Jr. and the strong Edwards, the rest of the US starting lineup was at a disadvantage in their matchups against Lithuania. Even though the second unit had Tyrese Haliburton and Brandon Ingram, who had better physical attributes for their positions, Lithuania always found ways to attack Austin Reaves with team coverage. Lithuania outrebounded the US 43 to 27, and their second unit had a 17-2 advantage in scoring. Including Kuzminskas' offensive rebound and score at the end of the third quarter, Lithuania was able to maintain a safe distance from the US second unit until the fourth quarter. Fortunately, Lithuania had accumulated enough second unit offensive efforts in the first three quarters to maintain their lead. Otherwise, if Lithuania had only grabbed one offensive rebound and traded scores in the fourth quarter, the US's comeback could have been successful. As for the US, in the preliminary rounds, Josh Hart replaced Ingram in the starting lineup to address Ingram's slump. The starting lineup consisted of Hart, Mikal Bridges, and Jalen Brunson, who were all part of the Villanova championship connection. However, this starting lineup was clearly a \"one big, four small\" lineup with no ambiguity. This also indicates that Edwards was the only scoring threat, and Bridges and Hart, although they are considered \"functional wing players\" with some offensive explosiveness, are not like Valanciunas, who can dismantle opponents in the low post or superstars like Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, or at least Dwyane Wade, who can score in high-level games. From the US's starting lineup, or the team's overall selection, we can see that the US has many outstanding functional players. However, in this game against Lithuania, the flaws of this lineup were evident.</p>"},{"location":"20230918091550282696/","title":"After the World Cup match, Reaves went to the German locker room to congratulate Schroder","text":"<p>After the World Cup match, Reaves went to the German locker room to congratulate Schroder.

Abassi, on the other hand, was already set as the sixth man, serving as the first player off the bench to charge and break through the defense. How will these two players contribute to the Asian Games? Let's take a look.</p> <p>Please continue reading below. As a specialist in off-ball movement, Abassi, originally from Senegal, officially became a local player this year and was immediately called up to the national team. In the past two professional seasons, he not only performed well but also won numerous individual awards, gaining recognition for his skills. It is expected that he will enhance the offensive capabilities of the Chinese team.</p> <p>During the Jones Cup, Abassi fearlessly faced opponents with better physique and skills. He scored in double digits in the first four games and demonstrated excellent steal skills. His outstanding physical abilities allowed him to launch transition attacks and score points. In the game against Japan, he was like a sharp blade entering the paint, catching the defense off guard. He scored 31 points with a +/- value of 21, delivering his best performance of the tournament. Abassi's excellent off-ball movement is a result of his professional training. With his quick reflexes and high release point, he can easily shoot after receiving the ball. His explosive first step is also remarkable. Although he lacks finesse in dribbling skills to deceive opponents, his sharp senses and speed make up for it, making him a primary scoring option against stronger opponents. However, despite his impressive numbers, he still needs more opportunities to score due to his inconsistent shooting stability. How to improve his efficiency in scoring will be a crucial decision for Abassi during the offensive plays. In addition, as shown in the table above, Abassi is also not lacking in assists. Although he is not the primary ball-handler, he can attract double teams with his offensive threats and make effective passes, whether it is for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers or the Chinese national team. This ability to connect the team makes him a powerful weapon. He is willing to share the ball and has the habit of observing his teammates' movements during attacks. His excellent hang time allows him to find open teammates in the air. Perhaps he can assist in controlling the ball and alleviating pressure in the absence of Chen Yingjun.</p> <p>The Chinese team lacks sufficient penetration ability, and Abassi will undoubtedly be a necessary player in the coming years. His ability to tear through defenses is a force that cannot be ignored. He will be the most important scoring option outside of the CBA's \"big three\" and Atino.</p> <p>Please continue reading below. Since joining a professional team, Li Qiwei has established himself as a \"high tower shooter,\" standing at 192 cm tall and providing a high release point. His shooting mechanics are stable and he has a good sense of balance. Whether playing for Pauian Archiland in the SBL or the Taipower Bears in T1, he is an important scoring force for his teams. He has never been selected for the national team before, so this is an excellent opportunity for him to prove himself.</p> <p>In the Jones Cup, he played in all the games except against the United States, averaging 4.5 three-point attempts and making 2 shots per game. This level of consistency is not something that guards can achieve. Therefore, even if his scoring numbers are not as impressive as other key players, as long as he can make his shots, he can effectively create space for the offense. This allows players like Atino, Liu Zheng in the frontcourt, or Lin Tingqian and Abassi in the backcourt to have more opportunities to attack the paint. Please continue reading below. With the effective screening of Lin Tingqian and Atino, Li Qiwei's positioning becomes even more important. Rising to the starting lineup in the middle and later stages of the tournament, he prevents opponents from easily double-teaming or shrinking their defense. He has truly become the solution for the Chinese team's second and third positions.</p> <p>However, his main weakness is evident, which is his lack of impact outside of offense. Particularly, his defense is relatively weak, making him vulnerable against opponents with strong forwards. He can only rely on his identity as a high tower shooter and cannot become an outstanding 3D player.</p> <p>But with other players on the court who have more diverse skills in the Jones Cup, as long as Li Qiwei shoots well, even with about 20 minutes of playing time, he can still make significant contributions.</p> <p>Li Qiwei is the best choice among the players added to the team this time, in the author's opinion. Although he lacks defensive skills, his height brings many advantages. The overall team height has been improved, allowing them to slow down opponents' penetration and shots, and even provide better defense and rebounding. In addition to his shooting ability, he is also a player with a great attitude. Regardless of whether the team is leading or trailing, he always brings a never-give-up mentality to the court. From being the sixth man in the past to now starting in the frontcourt, his professionalism deserves a chance to be tested. Please continue reading below. Who will be the best supporting player off the bench? The key to finding suitable supporting players through domestic professional basketball is crucial for the 18-man roster, which has now been reduced to the final 12. The \"big three\" of the CBA and naturalized player Atino are the core of the team's offense and defense. Finding players with sufficient offensive capabilities is especially important; otherwise, the main players may struggle to keep up with the scoring, and it may even lead to their inability to continue playing, resulting in a loss of competitiveness in the decisive stages of the game. Abassi is undoubtedly an offensive weapon for the young generation in China. His all-around and impactful offense, despite being only 189 cm tall, can bring trouble to opponents. He will be the primary offensive option outside of the core players. Li Qiwei's shooting ability may not dominate the game, but he is the most effective player in creating space for the offense. This will improve the team's height and reduce the disadvantages in defense and rebounding. Both players will be the best supporting players for the Chinese men's basketball team in the Asian Games, and their places in the rotation are already secured.</p>"},{"location":"20230919091130190375/","title":"2023 TGF World Firefighting Cup Basketball Tournament - Exclusive Interview with Xinmin High School","text":"<p>Xinmin High School from Taichung is a team composed of basketball enthusiasts who train independently after school    2023 TGF World Firefighting Cup Basketball Tournament - Exclusive Interview with Xinmin High School</p> <p>Xinmin High School from Taichung is a team composed of basketball enthusiasts who train independently after school. They emerged as a dark horse in the district preliminaries, defeating strong opponents and clinching the runner-up position in the central region. With a majority of freshmen and sophomores, they have shown great competitiveness this year, always delivering powerful blows to their opponents in crucial moments. Although they did not advance to the group stage of the national tournament, their strength should not be underestimated. </p> <p>To understand why they are described as a dark horse, it is important to note that all teams in the national tournament had to overcome the challenges of unfamiliar venues and environments. Despite these difficulties, Xinmin High School showed unwavering determination. In the group stage, they put significant pressure on their opponents. In the first match against the current national champion, Zhiping High School, they narrowly lost by four points. They also achieved a big victory against Jingwen High School and had a close match against Kaohsiung Vocational High School, losing by only six points. This demonstrates their ability to compete against strong teams from different regions.</p> <p>The theme of the TGF Cup is inheritance and sustainability. Although Xinmin High School has a majority of freshmen and sophomores, they rely heavily on the guidance of their senior players. The seniors expressed that the younger players have higher talent and physical abilities than them. They hope that the younger players will continue to work hard and help the team secure a spot in the South District of Taichung, looking forward to a better ranking in the next TGF Cup. The team captain, Lin Yukai, plays a crucial role in stabilizing team morale. He leads the team to break through difficult situations and his most memorable game was the district preliminaries against Dajia Industrial High School. The match went into double overtime, but with the team's collective efforts, they emerged victorious, securing a spot in the top four and earning the runner-up title. Lin Yukai was also selected as one of the tournament's best five players. As the captain, he has learned the importance of listening to different opinions and discovering each player's suitable role on the court.</p> <p>After graduation, Lin Yukai will pursue his dream of attending a police academy, embarking on the next journey of his life. The rest of the younger players will also continue to improve themselves, carrying the expectations of their seniors. Whether they can achieve their goals in the league and how far this dark horse can go in the future is something worth looking forward to.</p>"},{"location":"20230919091154126489/","title":"The Portrait of Jordan in his Nike Era: Jordan's Time at UNC","text":"<p>In the previous articles, we discussed the early years of Michael Jordan, the iconic figure who wore Nike shoes and was often referred to as the \"Jesus of Basketball   The Portrait of Jordan in his Nike Era: Jordan's Time at UNC</p> <p>In the previous articles, we discussed the early years of Michael Jordan, the iconic figure who wore Nike shoes and was often referred to as the \"Jesus of Basketball.\" During his time at the University of North Carolina (UNC), Jordan faced challenges and opportunities that shaped his career.</p> <p>When Jordan first joined UNC, ESPN had just begun broadcasting basketball games, and coverage was not as extensive as it is today. Additionally, UNC's offensive strategy focused more on teamwork rather than individual performances, making it difficult for people to witness Jordan's incredible offensive skills. Nonetheless, stories of Jordan's legendary abilities circulated among basketball scouts, assistant coaches, journalists, and dedicated UNC fans. They claimed to have witnessed Jordan's amazing moves in Chapel Hill or saw him dominate opponents in games.</p> <p>Dean Smith, the head coach at UNC, recognized Jordan's potential and was pleased with his progress. However, he believed that Jordan had not yet achieved enough to be featured on the cover of a sports magazine. When the Sports Illustrated magazine requested to feature four of UNC's starting players on their preseason special issue, Smith agreed but specifically excluded Jordan. He explained his decision to Jordan, stating that the other players had proven their worth, but Jordan had yet to make a significant impact.</p> <p>As a result, when the magazine was released, only Sam Perkins, James Worthy, Matt Doherty, and Jimmy Black appeared on the cover. Interestingly, when UNC won the NCAA national championship that season, Jordan finally made an appearance on the magazine cover. </p> <p>During the 1981-82 season, UNC reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament. They defeated the University of Houston, led by Clyde Drexler and Akeem Olajuwon (later known as Hakeem Olajuwon), in a close game. In the championship game, UNC faced Georgetown University, which was considered one of the strongest teams in college basketball. The matchup between UNC and Georgetown was often seen as a battle between black and white players, with Dean Smith and John Thompson, the head coach of Georgetown, representing different racial backgrounds. However, Smith and Thompson were good friends, and both teams emphasized discipline and academic success for their players.</p> <p>Georgetown's standout player was center Patrick Ewing, known for his size, strength, and speed. Despite Ewing's dominance, UNC players remained confident and well-prepared. The game showcased Georgetown's aggressive defense against UNC's well-coordinated teamwork. Ewing's defensive efforts led to several goaltending calls against him, frustrating UNC. However, UNC's James Worthy had a remarkable performance, scoring 28 points on 13 of 17 shooting. Although Jordan's offensive skills were not as sharp as Worthy's at that time, he contributed with 9 rebounds and showed no fear against formidable opponents like Ewing.</p> <p>In the final minutes of the game, with UNC leading by just one point, Dean Smith instructed the team to slow down the pace and consume the remaining time. However, Jordan saw an opportunity and made a daring move towards the basket. He switched the ball from his right hand to his left, avoiding Ewing's defense, and released a high-arcing shot that gracefully dropped into the basket.</p> <p>UNC emerged victorious with a final score of 63-62, securing the national championship. This game further solidified Jordan's reputation as a rising star and showcased his ability to perform under pressure. Despite his still-developing skills, Jordan's impact on the court was undeniable, and his journey was only just beginning.</p>"},{"location":"20230919091224426298/","title":"The inter-league invitation game last night was interrupted by Lin Bing-sheng, who took Cao Xun-xiang to the riverbank to shoot hoops","text":"<p>The inter-league invitation game last night was interrupted by Lin Bing-sheng, who took Cao Xun-xiang to the riverbank to shoot hoops. Taipei Taishin Warriors faced the Navigators, who had suffered two consecutive defeats before the game, and the Dreamers Training Team. It wasn't until the fourth quarter that Taipei Taishin Warriors opened up a gap with Cao Xun-xiang scoring 7 points in a single quarter. They eventually won 88-69, with Cao Xun-xiang scoring 21 points. Cao Xun-xiang revealed that after becoming \"neighbors\" with Lin Bing-sheng in the adjacent room, he was \"harassed\" every morning and evening, even going to the riverbank for training. Cao Xun-xiang disclosed, \"He knocks on our door every morning and asks me to go shoot hoops. He's crazy!\" Lin Bing-sheng, who became a hot topic this summer due to his contract, scored 7 points at the start of today's game and contributed 10 points in the first 12 minutes of the team. However, the Navigators and the Dreamers Training Team caught up later, trailing 20-22 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, the team caught up with 8 consecutive points from Dongfang Yi-kang, but Cao Xun-xiang and Lin Yi-hui scored back-to-back, helping Taipei Taishin Warriors maintain a 67-61 lead after three quarters. They widened the gap in the fourth quarter and ultimately won 88-69, securing their third consecutive victory. Cao Xun-xiang was only on the court for 9 minutes yesterday before being fouled out. Today, he played for 22 minutes and scored 21 points, along with 6 assists. He joked, \"I made up for the time I missed playing yesterday. I played more than twice the amount today.\" He also revealed that after joining Taipei Taishin Warriors, he became neighbors with Lin Bing-sheng. His new teammate would knock on his door at 9 o'clock in the morning. Even after team training and strength training in the evening, Lin Bing-sheng would not let him off. \"At 9:30 in the evening, he would still ask me to go to the riverbank to shoot hoops. He's just that crazy!\" Cao Xun-xiang also confessed that he followed Lin Bing-sheng's lead and trained early in the morning and late at night. He even vomited once after a training session, to which Lin Bing-sheng responded with a laugh, saying, \"That's why he's getting thinner. His goal is to lose 16 kilograms, just like Lin Yi-hui.\" Why would they go to the riverbank for self-training at night? Lin Bing-sheng smiled and said, \"I feel that I'm not good enough, so I need to practice and learn more.\" Dongfang Yi-kang, a member of the Navigators and the Dreamers Training Team, who was also Lin Bing-sheng's former teammate, coincidentally mentioned that during their time at the Bank of Taiwan, the two of them often trained independently and went to the riverbank to practice shooting, which coincided with Cao Xun-xiang's statement.

After experiencing the cancellation of the tournament in 2022 due to the pandemic, they once again challenged themselves and emerged as the champions in both the North District and the national finals for the single-school division this year. Facing tough opponents from all directions, Zhiping High School overcame all obstacles. During the journey to the final in the south, the team even encountered difficulties and experienced a setback in the first two days. However, they successfully adjusted on the third day and found their own rhythm. In the championship game against Kaohsiung Vocational High School, they achieved sweet revenge and brought the national title back to the North District for the first time since 2018.</p> <p>Zhiping High School already had a Class A basketball team, but due to the system, they were unable to form a team consisting of regular students to participate in the Class B league.

However, because it was their first time, they also experienced a completely different style of play and atmosphere.</p> <p>When asked about the most memorable games in the North District preliminary round and the national finals, 16-year-old Yu Mengxun said, \"In the preliminary round, we would have secured a spot in the top four with a victory, but our own mistakes led to a loss. However, in the finals, we had another chance to face Xiongong. In this game, we improved on our previous shortcomings, and our three-point shooting percentage also increased. The key was the coach's change in defensive tactics. Only after adjusting on both ends of the court were we able to achieve victory and successfully avenge our previous defeat.\"</p> <p>However, Zhiping High School encountered some challenges when they traveled south. The players mentioned that they were too relaxed in the first two games of the national tournament, which made the first victory difficult. In the second game, they made too many mistakes and couldn't make the necessary adjustments in time, resulting in a loss. From the third game onwards, they gradually improved and became more aggressive in their defense. In the semifinals, they reached their expected performance level. Even after the games, they would discuss the issues that arose during the matches and how to make improvements. With everyone offering advice to each other and making timely adjustments, coupled with their growing cohesion, they were able to ultimately claim the championship.</p> <p>In addition, Chen Liyu, who won the Finals Most Valuable Player (FMVP) award, made a strong impression. He stepped up in the championship game and provided offensive firepower for the team. Yu Mengxun, after winning the FMVP award in the preliminary round, also received the Assist Leader award in the finals, while Zhang Enqi won the Steal Leader award. These three players played crucial roles and their chemistry contributed to Zhiping High School's success in winning the championship.</p> <p>Coach Huang Defeng, who led the team to victory, also received the Best Coach award from the tournament organizers. When asked about his journey this year, he expressed his gratitude for the Firefighters' Cup for providing such a great stage for the young athletes to showcase their talents and prove themselves. He admitted that they did not expect to win the championship this year, as compared to last year, the team was not in as good physical condition and lacked experience. However, the trust, unity, and never-give-up spirit among the players touched and made him and Coach Wu Zhengxian proud. He hopes that they can pass on this energy to the younger students and wishes for their continuous improvement.</p> <p>Finally, Zhiping High School expresses their gratitude to the Firefighters' Cup for providing this platform for their players to be seen.

Kerr, who won a gold medal in the FIBA World Cup in 1986, also talked about the weight of responsibility. Kerr explained, \"Pressure is self-imposed. We all love what we do, I love coaching, and I also love the pressure or what we call competition. Being a competitor also means accepting the possibility of defeat, that's what the game is about, there's winning and losing.\" He also added, \"Effort, method, and chemistry are key. I love being part of a team, I love what we're doing at this moment, trying to build something and taking risks. Of course, the charm of sports is that there's no risk to life. But we will compete, we will give our all, we will strive for glory, and we also know that if we fail, we may face criticism, and we accept that.\" \"But our mindset is that this is a very enjoyable thing, we're extremely fortunate to be a part of all this, to compete, and when we look back on all this in the future, we know that we've given it our all. As I said, we're working hard, we want to win, but whatever happens, happens, and we will accept it because that's part of the game.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230919091547123305/","title":"World Cup Notes: The Giant Warriors of Cape Verde and Puerto Ricans Not Born in Puerto Rico","text":"<p>Cape Verde, please continue reading* Cape Verde had a population of only 590,000 in 2023, making it the smallest country to qualify for the World Cup   World Cup Notes: The Giant Warriors of Cape Verde and Puerto Ricans Not Born in Puerto Rico</p> <p>Cape Verde, please continue reading* Cape Verde had a population of only 590,000 in 2023, making it the smallest country to qualify for the World Cup.</p> <ul> <li>In 2013, the United Nations representative for Cape Verde stated that the correct name should be Cabo Verde, which is the name in Portuguese.

A German coach was on vacation on the island of Mallorca in Cape Verde when he saw the towering Tavares working at his grandmother's grocery store after school. The coach thought he would be a good basketball player and asked him if he wanted to play. However, Tavares misunderstood and thought the German coach wanted him to play soccer. It was only later that he realized it was basketball. He had never played basketball before and only knew about Michael Jordan. He was recommended by the German coach to go to Gran Canaria, and within two years, he made it to the Spanish second division. At the age of 22, he secured a spot in the Spanish first division, became the shot-blocking king, and was selected in the second round of the NBA draft. After returning to Europe, he became the record holder for blocked shots in the EuroLeague.</p> </li> <li> <p>Initially, the most difficult thing for the German coach to let Edy Tavares play basketball was not his willingness but the fact that there was no measuring tape on the island to accurately measure his height. He didn't even know how tall he was in centimeters. * This year, the Portland Trail Blazers offered Edy Tavares a three-year, 18 million dollar contract, but he chose to stay with Real Madrid and signed an early contract extension at the end of June. It is said that the contract is worth more than 3.5 million euros, making him the second highest-paid player in Europe.</p> </li> <li> <p>However, there is a big gap between Edy Tavares and other Cape Verdean players. Originally, they were supposed to have naturalized players, such as 6'3\" power forward Bonzie Colson, who played for the University of Notre Dame. His mother is from Cape Verde. After Tavares contacted him, Colson declined the invitation to naturalize for Jordan, which led to Jordan eventually acquiring Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. Unfortunately, neither of them could play in this tournament. * The other well-known Cape Verdean players are Betinho Gomes and Ivan Almeida. Betinho was born in Cape Verde and played for the Cape Verde U16 national team before switching to represent Portugal. He played in the Spanish first division for seven years and was the leading scorer and rebounder for Portugal in the EuroBasket qualification in 2016. He returned to represent Cape Verde in 2021 at the age of 38, saying that it was an opportunity he had been waiting for for twenty years.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ivan Almeida studied in the United States and played for Stonehill College in Massachusetts (which has now moved up to Division I). He has played in several European leagues, including being named MVP in Poland. * Many Cape Verdeans go to Massachusetts in the northeastern United States because it is currently the largest settlement of Cape Verdeans in the world. Out of the 100,000 Cape Verdeans in the United States, more than 70,000 are in Massachusetts, and nearly 20,000 are in New York and Rhode Island. The reason for this is that as early as the late 17th century, Cape Verdeans went to the New England region of the United States as sailors and worked as whalers. This history was also mentioned in Herman Melville's famous literary work, \"Moby-Dick.\" The character Daggoo, a harpooner in \"Moby-Dick,\" is based on Cape Verdeans.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Puerto Rico* Puerto Rico is a U.S. overseas territory, and all Puerto Ricans have U.S. citizenship. However, unlike Guam, Puerto Rico has its own passport and its own congress. Puerto Rico also has representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives, but they have only speaking rights. Local Puerto Ricans do not have the right to vote for the U.S. president but have the right to vote for the Puerto Rican governor. * In the past, many people had the impression that Puerto Rico was like a small U.S. team, but in reality, they are even more extreme. Former national team point guard Angel Rodriguez once said that he had to play center at around 6'2\" on the street courts of Puerto Rico.</p> <p>Even at the national team level, they have always lacked power forwards taller than 6'9\" and centers taller than 6'10\". Players taller than these measurements are usually relegated to the role of enforcers.</p>"},{"location":"20230920091134056384/","title":"NBA player Jermaine O'Neal expressed his disappointment with the Indiana Pacers for allowing his jersey number 7 to be worn by other players","text":"<p>NBA player Jermaine O'Neal expressed his disappointment with the Indiana Pacers for allowing his jersey number 7 to be worn by other players.

The key is being able to play basketball together with everyone. He specifically said, \"To the future juniors of CHH in the inter-school competition, I think the essence of the World Fire Protection Cup is to allow everyone to gather and play basketball before graduation. I hope that we won't let the competition affect our harmony, and I also hope that CHH can continue the tradition of being all Changhua people. I would also like to express my special thanks to every member of the team who cooperated with me to form CHH again. They followed my instructions and arrangements in the game. Thank you all for taking this competition seriously. I look forward to the senior college group continuing next year so that we can reunite every summer.\"</p> <p>Another player, Lin Youhua, who was once the \"War God\" of Chung Shih High School, led his team to the South District playoffs. He is younger in the CHH lineup this time, but he still performs like a warrior on the court. He provides outside firepower at critical moments and is one of the players that opponents need to defend against. As a junior, he mentioned that due to the suspension of the tournament in his senior year of high school because of the pandemic, this is his first time participating in CHH. Just coincidentally, the senior college group was introduced this time, and he had the opportunity to wear the CHH jersey that he had always dreamed of. He said with a smile, \"I am very happy to compete with seniors from different years. I used to be amazed by their skills, only able to watch them dominate in various competitions. It feels wonderful to be on the same team with them now.\"</p> <p>In addition, playing in high school is more like a gathering of classmates, but this time, being able to represent Changhua together with the seniors to compete for glory gives a special feeling. Especially for those seniors who were amazing and could only be silently admired in the past, being able to stand on the court and fight together with them today brings great joy. Finally, it is an honor to accompany the fourth-year seniors on their last stage before graduation. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Both of them expressed that being able to reunite everyone through the World Fire Protection Cup and allowing CHH to continue not only in high school but also in college is thanks to the tournament benefitting amateur players like them. It also provides a stage for players from the regular group to continue to excel. They also express their gratitude to every staff member for providing us with such a wonderful stage and environment.</p> <p>Every reunion has its meaning. Whether it is from the words or the performances of the players on and off the court, we can see their sense of belonging and identification with the name and team of CHH. Being able to use the World Fire Protection Cup to connect players from different years and maintain this tradition is the long-term goal and philosophy of the tournament.</p> <p>Although the juniors in the inter-school competition this year did not have the opportunity to stand on the national tournament stage with the seniors, we believe that after the seniors have showcased CHH, whether it is the players in the senior college group or those who compete in the inter-school group, they will be able to continue this tradition and promote the glory of CHH, which belongs to Changhua people.</p>"},{"location":"20230920091321057066/","title":"The North Carolina Years of Jordan: The Portrait of Jesus Wearing NIKE","text":"<p>In the previous review, we continued reading about the portrait of Jesus wearing NIKE - Michael Jordan's time at North Carolina    The North Carolina Years of Jordan: The Portrait of Jesus Wearing NIKE</p> <p>In the previous review, we continued reading about the portrait of Jesus wearing NIKE - Michael Jordan's time at North Carolina. Michael Jordan earned himself a starting position on the North Carolina team through his skills and abilities. In that year, the Sports Illustrated magazine requested Dean Smith to have four of the starting players featured on the cover of their preseason special issue, excluding Michael Jordan. Smith explained to Jordan that he hadn't achieved enough to be on the cover yet, unlike his teammates who had already proven themselves.</p> <p>As a result, the magazine cover only featured Sam Perkins, James Worthy, Matt Doherty, and Jimmy Black. However, when North Carolina won the NCAA national championship that season, the entire starting lineup, including Michael Jordan, appeared on the cover. During Jordan's time at North Carolina, there were limited opportunities to witness his amazing offensive talents due to the lack of basketball game broadcasts and the team's focus on teamwork. The legend of Jordan's skills primarily spread through word of mouth, from scouts, assistant coaches, basketball journalists, and hardcore North Carolina fans. They would say they had witnessed Michael Jordan's incredible moves at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill or how he dominated opponents in various games.</p> <p>Some claimed that Jordan, who stood at 6 feet 1 inch, could out-jump opponents who were 5 inches taller than him. Others said he was 6 feet 8 inches tall and had the ball-handling skills of Magic Johnson. There were even stories of Jordan seemingly defying gravity and staying in the air longer than Julius Erving during a slam dunk. Dean Smith was pleased with Jordan's progress. He worked hard and was an excellent learner. However, Jordan still had areas to improve, such as his consistency in mid-range shooting, especially when opponents focused on guarding Worthy or Perkins, leaving Jordan open.</p> <p>In the 1981-82 season, North Carolina once again reached the Final Four of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. They defeated the University of Houston, which would later produce legendary stars Clyde Drexler and Akeem Olajuwon (later known as Hakeem), with a score of 68-63. In the final, North Carolina faced the formidable Georgetown University. It was considered a dream matchup of the two strongest teams in college basketball. Some fans even saw it as a racial matchup, with Dean Smith being white and John Thompson, the head coach of Georgetown, being black. However, Smith and Thompson were good friends. Both led strong teams and emphasized punctuality and graduation for their players. Although Georgetown had more players from economically disadvantaged backgrounds compared to North Carolina, the game was not about race.</p> <p>Georgetown's star player was center Patrick Ewing, who was tall, strong, and fast. His mobility surpassed many taller college players, making him a terrifying force on both offense and defense. However, the experienced North Carolina players were not intimidated. While Georgetown had the advantage in physique, North Carolina had confidence and excelled in pre-game preparations. They were a cohesive and complete team. On the court, Georgetown relied on five physically dominant players to apply full-court pressure defense for 40 minutes. North Carolina countered with excellent team passing and clear roles. Ewing, perhaps too aggressively, tried to block every shot from North Carolina players, resulting in him being called for goaltending five times in North Carolina's first nine field goal attempts.</p> <p>In this game, James Worthy was outstanding, scoring 28 points on 13-of-17 shooting. He was strong, fast, and had a keen sense of the game, whether he had the ball or not. Jordan had not yet displayed the same level of sharpness in offense as Worthy, but he grabbed 9 rebounds and faced opponents like Ewing without fear. With North Carolina leading 59-58 in the final minutes, Dean Smith instructed the team to slow down the pace and use up as much time as possible. However, Jordan saw an opportunity. He dribbled into the paint, with Ewing quickly switching to defend him. Jordan switched the ball from his right hand to his left hand and released a high shot to avoid Ewing's outstretched hand. The trajectory of the ball was higher than a typical layup and appeared as if it would go out of bounds behind the backboard. However, the ball smoothly descended from its highest point and gently dropped into the basket, leaving Roy Williams, sitting on the North Carolina coaching bench, initially concerned that the shot would go out of bounds.</p> <p>(Note: This translation has been edited for clarity and coherence.)</p>"},{"location":"20230920091403428197/","title":"Cross-League Invitational Tournament: Taisin Joins Cross-League Battle, PLG Dream Team and Yoyo Army Form Alliance","text":"<p>September 8, 2023, 14:53 - United Daily News: This year's Cross-League Basketball Invitational Tournament has officially unveiled the seven participating teams    Cross-League Invitational Tournament: Taisin Joins Cross-League Battle, PLG Dream Team and Yoyo Army Form Alliance</p> <p>September 8, 2023, 14:53 - United Daily News: This year's Cross-League Basketball Invitational Tournament has officially unveiled the seven participating teams.</p> <p>Last year, the first edition of the Cross-League Basketball Invitational Tournament took place, and this year, it was announced that the second edition will be held on September 16.

In early September, he joined the Attack Lions for the Xiamen Professional Basketball Invitational Tournament.

Looking at the roster, Jalen Brunson and Brandon Ingram represented the middle generation, while young stars like Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton joined them. On the defensive end, they had the newly crowned best defensive player Jaren Jackson Jr. and Walker Kessler guarding the paint. Although they didn't have superstars, I was optimistic about their chances of winning the gold medal.</p> <p>Continuing to read on, despite dominating their opponents in the group stage, the US team still faced their biggest problem on the international stage - spacing.</p> <p>The biggest difference between FIBA and NBA rules is the allowance of a 3-second violation in the paint, which means that creating space on the FIBA court can be more congested. Observing this US team, two major issues can be identified - the quality of screening by big men and the lack of efficiency in perimeter shooting and receiving. This led to the offense relying heavily on isolation plays. However, apart from Anthony Edwards, the efficiency of isolation plays was not high. Especially for Brunson, who is known for his efficient offense in the NBA, his height became a disadvantage in the narrow FIBA space. The limited space resulted in more double teams, which compressed his preferred vertical shooting space. As a result, the team's most organized point guard in the starting lineup was contained, leading to an overreliance on transition offense as the most effective scoring method.</p> <p>However, when the starting lineup was replaced with substitutes like Tyrese Haliburton and Austin Reaves, some relief was found. Haliburton, as a pass-first point guard, often adjusted his own attacking mode to cooperate with his teammates.</p> <p>From learning how to switch between on-ball and off-ball movements with De'Aaron Fox when he first entered the league, to playing with the Toronto Raptors alongside players like Bennedict Mathurin and Myles Turner, Haliburton understood the art of resetting himself. In this US team, his combination with Reaves and Paolo Banchero brought a different style, whether it was lurking on the perimeter and shooting cold arrows or cutting and distributing the ball after receiving it. They even broke through deadlock situations and scored individually. With Haliburton's help, this substitute combination helped the US team come back from behind in many games. Continuing to read on, let's look at the outlook for the next season.</p> <p>What excites the fans of the Sacramento Kings is that despite being a supporting role alongside other stars, Haliburton, who often positions himself as a shooter, quietly adds to his outside shooting arsenal. Moreover, when faced with a stalemate, he is willing to take the ball and attack the basket, whether it's through drives, mid-range jumpers, or hostage dribbles that are essential for top guards. All of these were seen in this tournament, and his improved dribbling allows him to have more means to organize the team's offense when faced with a deadlock, instead of relying solely on one-step three-point jumpers like last season, trying to break the opponent's defense.</p> <p>Improved ball-handling means increased offensive threat, combined with his elite spatial awareness and court understanding, making him more threatening on the offensive end in the upcoming season.</p> <p>On the defensive end, Haliburton's progress is also evident. In addition to his already excellent steal instincts, he has improved his footwork in one-on-one defense and timing and positioning when navigating screens. Although his slim physique makes it challenging for him to switch on defense, he can still apply pressure to guards with his long arms. He can also use his footwork to navigate around screens and disrupt the opponent's passing lanes, causing them more significant problems. Continuing to read on, even though he didn't help the US team win a medal, it is still a bit unfortunate. However, Haliburton's performance in the World Cup showed us that his impact goes beyond statistics (averaging 8.6 points, 3 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game). His attention to detail in running off the ball and his synergy with teammates demonstrate that this young point guard, who was selected as an All-Star for the first time last year, is still evolving. Last season, he achieved an average of 20 points and 10 assists per game, and we look forward to seeing him become a more well-rounded facilitator in the upcoming season, leading the Sacramento Kings to greater heights.</p>"},{"location":"20230922091257466226/","title":"Aggressive Leadership Style of Dennis Schroder and Germany's Unfinished Mission","text":"<p>The preparations for the previous EuroBasket tournament evidently had an impact on the present   Aggressive Leadership Style of Dennis Schroder and Germany's Unfinished Mission</p> <p>The preparations for the previous EuroBasket tournament evidently had an impact on the present.

In the first game of the inter-league basketball invitational tournament today, they defeated SBL representative Taiwan Bank with a score of 87:76, even without their \"strongest foreign student\" Mobaye. Even the new member of Taiwan Bank, Neumann, praised his \"alma mater\" for its improvement.</p> <p>Neumann, who is 205cm tall and from Senegal, came to Taiwan for college and his first stop was PCCU. In his first season in the UBA, PCCU Eagles advanced to Men's Level 1. After helping the team win the championship in the 109th academic year, Neumann entered the 2021 PLG draft and was selected by the New Taipei Kings as the 7th pick in the first round. After two seasons with the Kings, he became a free agent this summer and officially joined Taiwan Bank in early September.</p> <p>In today's inter-league game against his alma mater, Neumann believes that PCCU has improved year by year. \"The current team is on a different level compared to when I was in school,\" he said. He pointed out that PCCU has a diverse offensive strategy, both inside and outside the paint, and plays with unity. However, he admitted that his own lack of attention to detail led to a 25:8 run by his alma mater in the third quarter. He believes that with better defense, they can still stop the younger players. After living in Taiwan for many years, Neumann can now speak some Chinese. He said that he is currently adjusting to his new teammates in Taiwan Bank and said in Chinese, \"Take it slowly.\" He looks forward to performing well in the new season in the SBL.</p> <p>Taiwan Bank head coach Chen Guowei is a member of the coaching staff for the Chinese men's basketball team at the Hangzhou Asian Games. Although he was present today, the team was managed by Xu Zhiqiang. Chen emphasized that today's defeat was \"due to our own mistakes.\" The team failed to meet the set standards in both offense and defense. \"Especially at the beginning of the third quarter, we allowed three three-pointers, and there were also many mistakes on offense. We couldn't maintain good ball movement and couldn't bring out the intensity. We didn't perform well ourselves, so the result is not surprising.\" PCCU relied on new foreign player Popoca as the main inside player today. Coach Chen Ziwei explained that Mobaye had some family issues and is expected to return on the 19th. This inter-league game against the soldiers is also a good opportunity to encourage the players to show their own attitude and style, and learn from the senior players on professional teams.</p>"},{"location":"20230923091307648373/","title":"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the rising star who fluctuates like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, faced off against Luka Don\u010di\u0107 in an intense international game","text":"<p>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the rising star who fluctuates like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, faced off against Luka Don\u010di\u0107 in an intense international game.</p> <p>Sharp as a weapon, cutting through iron like mud. Precise as the wind, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander resembles a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>Let's continue reading to discuss and share various perspectives on the game. The score was 100:89 in favor of Canada against Slovenia in the quarterfinals of the 2023 World Cup. Canada has made significant progress in recent years in the world basketball arena, reaching the semifinals of the World Cup (including its predecessor, the FIBA Basketball World Cup) for the first time in its history, and crushing Slovenia's dreams of reaching the semifinals. The biggest pre-game focus and post-game topic undoubtedly revolved around the world's number one star, Luka Don\u010di\u0107. Prior to the game, people were wondering whether Don\u010di\u0107, who was expected to be a candidate for NBA MVP in the upcoming season, could dominate and lead a complete Slovenian team to achieve their best international performance and even strive for the championship in the highly competitive World Cup. However, after the game, the focus shifted to his early ejection from the game due to two technical fouls he received.</p> <p>Please continue reading. Don\u010di\u0107 revealed after the game that a referee had informed Slovenian players that he would not give Don\u010di\u0107 the calls he wanted because of his disrespect towards the referees. This was evident in most situations during the game where Don\u010di\u0107 created collisions but the referee did not blow the whistle. Subsequently, Don\u010di\u0107 showed various expressions of dissatisfaction towards the referee, but his efforts to get the calls he wanted were in vain.</p> <p>To be honest, in this quarterfinal game, Canada did seem to have a slight advantage in terms of the calls. Don\u010di\u0107 may have had reasons to complain, but he paid the price for his complaints with technical fouls. Despite the team's efforts and the final score being only 4 points behind at the time of Don\u010di\u0107's ejection, Slovenia was left without their ace for the remaining half of the game, which hindered their comeback.</p> <p>Don\u010di\u0107 can be considered a loser both in appearance and reality, while Canada's ace, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, can be considered a double winner. He performed exceptionally well, and Canada secured a victory, achieving a new milestone in the team's history. The first meeting between these two players in an international game resulted in mixed emotions, with one rising and the other falling, which is perhaps something that few people would have expected.</p> <p>Please continue reading. In the 2017 EuroBasket, Slovenia emerged as the champion, with Goran Dragi\u0107, the main playmaker at the time, winning the tournament MVP. However, at the age of 18, Don\u010di\u0107 was already a rising star capable of shouldering the responsibility of being the team's leader. People noticed that he was another basketball prodigy from Europe who attracted attention at a young age, following in the footsteps of Ricky Rubio from Spain. Since that EuroBasket, Don\u010di\u0107 has soared onto the world stage and received significant attention at the 2018 NBA Draft. If it weren't for Deandre Ayton, who was a perfect fit for the Phoenix Suns as the number one pick regardless of position or background, Don\u010di\u0107 could have challenged for the top spot. Ultimately, he was selected third and joined the Dallas Mavericks through a trade. Since then, no one has been able to stop Don\u010di\u0107 from shining on various basketball courts. In his rookie year in the NBA, he averaged 21.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 6.0 assists, showcasing his versatility. In his five-year career, these numbers have only increased, and this season he has reached the extraordinary level of \"30-8-8\". In terms of the world stage, there is no doubt that Don\u010di\u0107 has taken over from Dragi\u0107 and become the absolute core of Slovenia's self-built system. In this year's World Cup, with the absence of Nikola Joki\u0107 from Serbia, Giannis Antetokounmpo from Greece, and other top American players, Don\u010di\u0107 recorded averages of 26.3 points (the highest in the tournament), 6.8 rebounds, and 6.5 assists, living up to his reputation as the tournament's number one star.</p> <p>Please continue reading. In terms of statistical performance, there is really nothing to question about Don\u010di\u0107. The term \"golden boy\" has been appropriate for him since he rose to fame at a young age and remains so today. The problem lies in the increasing number of instances in recent years where Don\u010di\u0107 has been seen arguing with referees, which has gotten him into trouble. In the past three seasons, Don\u010di\u0107 has ranked in the top three in technical fouls in the league, surpassing the league's threshold of 16 technical fouls that result in a suspension. In this World Cup quarterfinal game, his ejection from the game was not only due to two technical fouls, but also because of his expressions of dissatisfaction towards the referees, including counting money gestures, implying that the referees were being bribed and unfair. Although the referee's officiating may not have been ideal, Don\u010di\u0107's actions were definitely not acceptable and could be considered as a \"blemish\" for him.</p> <p>Of course, objectively speaking, Slovenia may not have been the most favored team to win the championship. The only reason there was some expectation surrounding them was because of Don\u010di\u0107. Having such a superstar raises hopes of him creating miracles. However, miracles did not happen this time, and Slovenia failed to reach the semifinals. Looking at the results, it may not necessarily be a disappointment, but the way Don\u010di\u0107 swallowed defeat, coupled with his ejection from the game, is reminiscent of the 2021 NBA Playoffs second round, where the MVP that season, Joki\u0107, was ejected from the game due to a malicious foul when his team was trailing 0-3 and helplessly watched his team get swept.</p>"},{"location":"20230924091129362327/","title":"202324 Key Player New Orleans Pelicans Trey Murphy III","text":"<p>When it comes to the Pelicans' X-factor, aside from the health of their star wings, Trey Murphy III and Herb Jones have shown significant growth    202324 Key Player New Orleans Pelicans Trey Murphy III</p> <p>When it comes to the Pelicans' X-factor, aside from the health of their star wings, Trey Murphy III and Herb Jones have shown significant growth. Murphy has seen an increase of 9 points per game, raising expectations for him to have a more important role on the offensive end next season. I have previously written an article about Trey Murphy III, and if you're interested, you can take a look. Player's Notes - More Than Just a Dunk Contest Runner-Up Trey Murphy III.</p> <p>This season, Trey's numbers have steadily improved, with his overall shooting percentage increasing by nearly ten percent. It's important to remember that he is only a sophomore and his explosive performance in the dunk contest has garnered attention. He is known for being an athletic and versatile wing, but his three-point shooting percentage of 40% should not be overlooked. In fact, this season he has shot 48% from the field, 40% from three-point range, and 90% from the free-throw line, coming close to the coveted 50-40-90 club. Many consider him a 3-and-D player due to his defensive abilities, but his defense may not be as strong as expected, so I wouldn't necessarily label him as such.</p> <p>Trey's offensive breakout this season was expected. In the second half of his rookie year, starting from March, he started getting around 19 minutes of playing time and scored in double digits multiple times. During this period, he had an impressive three-point shooting percentage of 43.8%. In a game against the Hornets in March, he scored 32 points, showing his willingness to take on offensive responsibilities. In a game against the Lakers, he scored 21 points in the second half, helping the team come from behind and secure a victory. In the playoffs, he maintained a three-point shooting percentage of nearly 50% in six games. Although the sample size is small, it is enough to trust in his ability to perform under pressure. His breakout has continued into his second year.</p> <p>While his ball-handling skills may still need improvement, his shooting threat allows him to challenge the defense by attacking the paint whenever opponents aggressively close out on him. His long arms and legs give him an advantage, making him a formidable finisher at the rim. Additionally, his fast break threat is evident in his playtype data, with Trey's fast break efficiency surpassing 91.4% of players in the league. If we set the criteria at a minimum of three possessions, only Tyrese Maxey of the 76ers outperforms him.</p> <p>He and Zion are an unstoppable combination, like a tank and a sniper rifle.</p> <p>Looking at his shot distribution, it's clear that Trey has yet to showcase his mid-range offensive skills. Although the mid-range game is becoming less prevalent in today's NBA, it is still important for a player aiming to become a star to master all aspects of offensive skills. Therefore, breaking through in mid-range offense will be a significant challenge for him next season. In offseason training videos, Trey has shown awareness of his weaknesses and has been working on improving his skills. This reminds me of Brandon Ingram, who also focused on improving his finishing and ball-handling abilities during the offseason, ultimately breaking out. Trey currently has a better foundation, although his ceiling may not be as high. However, we have seen many players in recent years break through their perceived ceilings, so Trey has the potential to be the next one.</p> <p>As for his defense, it must be said that Trey's current defensive abilities are at best average. His long frame limits his ability to defend in one-on-one situations, especially against pick-and-rolls. He is not a heavy-bodied player, which makes guarding both guards and heavier wings challenging for him. Currently, the Pelicans have him guard the second or third ball-handler, such as Dillon Brooks from the Grizzlies, Jalen Williams from the Thunder, and Mikal Bridges from his time with the Suns. However, his performance has been quite poor. Even when guarding players with similar body types, his performance is not satisfactory. I would even describe it as \"poor.\" Looking at advanced stats, Trey's on-court defensive efficiency is 112.8, which is the third-worst on the team, only better than CJ McCollum and Jonas Valanciunas. After he leaves the court, the defensive efficiency improves to 107.1, with only CJ McCollum having a larger discrepancy. Additionally, opponents have a 3.1% higher field goal percentage when guarded by Trey. Whether guarding guards or forwards, his matchups have been consistently subpar. Only when the team puts him in help defense positions can his weaknesses be somewhat masked and his defensive range highlighted. So, if someone calls him a defensive lock, it is clearly misinformation. The Pelicans desperately need him to improve his defense, or else Herb Jones might get overwhelmed.</p>"},{"location":"20230924091208167869/","title":"2023 TGF World Firefighting Continuation Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview - Tong Hong Freezing","text":"<p>Tong Hong Freezing, who won the national championship in the inter-school group at the 2020 Continuation Cup, returned to the tournament this year as part of the senior group    2023 TGF World Firefighting Continuation Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview - Tong Hong Freezing</p> <p>Tong Hong Freezing, who won the national championship in the inter-school group at the 2020 Continuation Cup, returned to the tournament this year as part of the senior group. They advanced to the national level as the champions of the southern region and ultimately finished as national runners-up. This year's achievement will undoubtedly make Tong Hong Freezing even stronger! After three years, Tong Hong Freezing has made significant improvements in team unity and strength. Let's hear their story!</p> <p>Tong Hong Freezing was founded in 2019 by team leader Chen Wei-hao. Chen Wei-hao admitted that the team had a smooth start during the early days of its establishment. At that time, Tong Hong Freezing only focused on high school basketball. In terms of high school basketball, Tong Hong Freezing was unbeatable, with very few losses. However, the real challenge came when they stepped out of their comfort zone and entered the social group competition. The intensity in the social group was much higher than in the high school group. It was not enough to rely solely on talented high school players to succeed. In the beginning, they faced numerous obstacles, but after two to three years of college experience, the players' physical fitness improved significantly, and they became more adaptable to high-intensity games. They gradually entered a better phase.</p> <p>The primary requirement for recruiting players for Tong Hong Freezing is good character, while basketball skills are considered secondary. Players represent not only themselves but also the team when they step onto the court. In recent years, team leader Chen Wei-hao has actively recruited players to join the Tong Hong Freezing family. Since the core members graduated from high school and went their separate ways, they had to search for new talents in the southern region to enhance the team's strength.</p> <p>Leading a good team is not just about managing people, but more importantly, it's about how to lead with heart. To cultivate a player in the long run, one must pay attention to this aspect. Chen Wei-hao said, \"Most of the players have been with me since high school, and it has been three or four years now. We also have new blood joining. I often chat with the players and gather together during private training sessions. I provide them with a stage to showcase their talents. Whenever the team achieves good results, we generously reward the players. This builds their confidence, both on and off the court. Everyone in the Tong Hong family feels proud and honored.\"</p> <p>\"My competitiveness is strong, and I want to lead a team that prioritizes teamwork and winning. I don't want to recruit mercenaries just to win a few tournaments and then disband. Because we share a common dream and goal, we prepare for every game to ensure the team's victory. Every member of Tong Hong has confidence in the team's brand,\" Chen Wei-hao said. </p> <p>Looking back at the Continuation Cup three years ago, Tong Hong Freezing first won the championship in the southern region by defeating Fu Wei Township in a thrilling game. They then went on to win the national championship by defeating CHH with a fast break play by Lin Yu-sheng. When Tong Hong Freezing returned to the tournament this year, all the crazy memories from that year rushed back. Chen Wei-hao believes that these memories will forever remain in the hearts of the players.</p> <p>Tong Hong Freezing has returned to the Continuation Cup this year, and Chen Wei-hao expressed his heartfelt emotions, saying, \"It's truly touching to be back here, experiencing that familiar feeling. The memories left by the Continuation Cup are overwhelming, and I feel very moved. Even though we are no longer high school students, the games in the college senior group are still filled with passion. The Continuation Cup is an important stage for the players.\"</p> <p>This year, Tong Hong Freezing defeated their strong rivals, Fu Ming International, in the championship game of the southern region. Unfortunately, they couldn't defeat Fu Ming International again in the national championship game. However, as the book \"Leadership: Leading with Heart\" says, \"When we win a game, it doesn't mean that everything is right. Conversely, when we lose a game, it doesn't mean that everything is wrong. In fact, sometimes failure can be a kind of victory.\" Chen Wei-hao also expressed, \"I don't feel ashamed of this defeat. It will make us stronger, and next time we meet in the same place, it won't be that simple.\"</p> <p>On Chen Wei-hao's journey to fulfilling his dream, the person he is most grateful for is his father. When he wanted to establish the team, his father and a few good friends supported him without hesitation, allowing him to move forward without worries. He also hopes that the players can study the game and soar high with their basketball skills. Finally, Chen Wei-hao wants to say to the players of Tong Hong Freezing, \"Thank you for your hard work in the Continuation Cup! Learn from the lessons of the national championship game's defeat and reclaim that feeling of not being satisfied. I appreciate your participation and thank you for playing for Tong Hong. I am sincerely proud of all of you. I want to win more than anyone else, but there are some things on the court that we, as players, cannot resist. All we can do is fight back with goals and defeat those who doubt us. I hope you all enjoy the atmosphere of playing basketball and the glory of being a Tong Hong player. Let's not allow it next year and bring back our championship!\"</p>"},{"location":"20230924091255693970/","title":"How South Sudanese Basketball Soul Luol Deng Saved South Sudan with Basketball","text":"<p>When Deng's basketball achievements are mentioned, most fans will think of his great accomplishments with the Bulls, including two All-Star selections and one All-Defensive Team selection   How South Sudanese Basketball Soul Luol Deng Saved South Sudan with Basketball</p> <p>When Deng's basketball achievements are mentioned, most fans will think of his great accomplishments with the Bulls, including two All-Star selections and one All-Defensive Team selection.

His father even served as a government official, including as deputy prime minister. When the second civil war broke out in Sudan, Deng's family first fled to Egypt and then sought political asylum in the UK. Deng also had the opportunity to learn from former NBA player Manute Bol during his time in Egypt, which set him on the path to basketball. Bol's humanitarian efforts in Sudan are more famous than his ten-year NBA career. He was a member of the advisory board of Sudan Sunrise, an organization dedicated to promoting Sudanese reconciliation and establishing 41 schools in South Sudan. Bol founded the Ring True Foundation to raise funds for the reconstruction and assistance of Sudan and invested most of his NBA salary in the foundation. \"He is not only an African basketball legend but also an important figure in helping South Sudan's independence,\" Deng said.</p> <p>Deng continued Bol's torch and continued to assist South Sudan through basketball.

Among them, Zhang Chenshuo, who won the scoring king and steals king in the finals, attracted a lot of attention for the team. In the preliminary round championship game, he scored 40 points with 9 three-pointers, setting a new scoring record for this year's tournament and winning the MVP. In addition, he averaged 29.7 points per game in the finals, leaving a deep impression with his outstanding individual performance. It was a great memory for the team to finish as national runners-up in their first participation in the tournament, and it was the best graduation gift for this special group of people. Please continue reading for more details about the composition of the inter-school group.</p> <p>Regarding the composition of the team in this inter-school group, Zhang Chenshuo said, \"Some of our team members are players from the A-level qualification games, while others are friends of teammates. The team was formed by Xu Junxiang from our team, and we all got to know each other through playing basketball or in A-level competitions.\" With the spirit of making friends through basketball, they came together by chance and cherished the opportunity.</p> <p>For Zhang Chenshuo, participating in the Firefighting Cup for the first time was a fulfilling experience. He sincerely said, \"The Firefighting Cup is really a tournament worth signing up for. It is like a league with many individual awards, which represents recognition for each player and can boost their confidence. I am very grateful to my teammates for inviting me to play in this tournament. It not only allowed me to meet more friends but also brought back the feeling of playing in a competition, which I haven't experienced for a long time. Finally, we advanced to the nationals and finished in 4th place. I hope my teammates will continue to work hard towards their goals. If there is a chance, we must gather again to play basketball. Thank you all. This is the happiest thing for me this year.\"</p> <p>Compared to the league, the Firefighting Cup brings a different experience to the players, especially in the inter-school group where they don't have a coach's guidance. Therefore, they need to quickly judge how to attack and defend on the court. Through this unique experience, they learned on-the-spot reactions and effective communication within the team, making the team a group of people moving forward together, rather than just individual players. </p> <p>After graduating from high school this year, Zhang Chenshuo is looking forward to participating in the senior group next year. He confidently said, \"If there is a chance next year, I will definitely come back to play in the senior group. I hope to win FMVP again, then advance to the nationals and finally win the national championship!\"</p> <p>Perhaps the runners-up result was not perfect for them, but for Zhang Chenshuo himself, his joy is evident. The full trust given to him by his teammates allowed him to fully unleash his potential, which is also a heartwarming aspect of this Firefighting Cup. We look forward to their return next year, continuing to create more unique memories on the battlefield of the Firefighting Cup.</p>"},{"location":"20230924091412382153/","title":"NBADeRozan on three-point shooting: I don't need to make changes, only 38 people score more than me","text":"<p>DeMar DeRozan is undoubtedly an outstanding mid-range scorer and dunker, but his three-point shooting is not considered exceptional    NBADeRozan on three-point shooting: I don't need to make changes, only 38 people score more than me</p> <p>DeMar DeRozan is undoubtedly an outstanding mid-range scorer and dunker, but his three-point shooting is not considered exceptional.

It was discovered that the announcement clause introduced in the 110th regulations, stating that \"coaches must obtain at least a C-level coaching certificate starting from the 113th academic year,\" had quietly been modified to \"coaches must obtain at least a C-level coaching certificate from the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association.\" This change will have a significant impact on the development of grassroots B division teams in high schools. Please continue reading for the 110th to 112th HBL competition regulations and the announcement clause for the coaching staff starting from the 113th academic year.</p> <p>The High School Basketball League (HBL) is an annual high school basketball competition organized by the Chinese Taipei High School Sports Federation (referred to as the High School Athletic Association), commissioned by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China. It was established in 1988 and is divided into four divisions: Men's A division, Men's B division, Women's A division, and Women's B division. The HBL is currently the largest high school sports competition in the country in terms of the number of participating teams. For example, in the 111th academic year, there were 40 teams in the Men's A division, 17 teams in the Women's A division, 271 teams in the Men's B division, and 99 teams in the Women's B division, totaling 427 high school teams competing for the HBL championship, pursuing their youth, dreams, and sweat.</p> <p>(Data source: High School Athletic Association website) Please continue reading for the thrilling High School Basketball League (photo source: Sports Vision Graphics) However, compared to the A division, which receives more media attention, the B division receives much less attention. Not only is the media coverage low, but resources from all sectors are also much less than in the A division. Although there are online media outlets such as \"TGF Sports Team\" and \"BE HEROES\" that report or broadcast B division games, for most teams that cannot make it to the top eight in the Northern or Southern region, their operations rely almost solely on \"passion\".  Please continue reading for the changes in the number of B division teams in the HBL in the past four years (self-compiled data) The number of B division teams participating in the HBL has gradually decreased from 395 teams in the 108th year to 370 teams in the 111th year, with a decrease of approximately 6.3% over four years. Among them, the B division women's teams experienced the largest decrease, with 18 fewer teams participating in the league, a decrease of 15.3%.</p> <p>The factors contributing to the decrease in the number of B division teams in the league can be summarized as follows: 1. Some teams challenging the A division: For example, New Taipei City Jinhe High School, which participated in the B division before the 109th academic year, challenged the Men's A division starting from the 110th academic year; and Hsinchu High School, which won three consecutive championships in the B division from the 108th to the 110th academic year, challenged the Women's A division starting from the 111th academic year.</p> <p>However, the number of teams challenging the A division from the B division in the past four years is actually not many, so it is not the main reason for the decrease in the number of participating teams. (Photo source: Sports Vision special photographer Shala) 2. Large disparity in B division strength: Unlike the University Basketball Association (UBA), where divisions are divided into Open Division 1, Open Division 2, and General Division (often referred to as A1, A2, A3), the high school basketball league does not have a similar division system. Open Division 1 and 2 have a promotion and relegation system and are primarily focused on student-athletes and students with excellent sports performance. The General Division is mainly composed of non-student-athletes and students from sports-related departments.</p> <p>Supplement: UBA's regulations regarding player qualifications in the General Division and Open Division: The following individuals (including overseas students) should participate in the Open Division: (1) Students who have previously enrolled in sports-related departments. (2) Students who have been admitted to five-year colleges and junior colleges according to the excellent sports performance admission guidance regulations for secondary and higher education institutions, including bonus points for selection, examination, individual enrollment, and transfer exams (transfer students who were previously in the General Division or B division are not subject to this limitation). (3) Students who have been admitted based on sports specialty tests or non-basic physical fitness tests or sports performance. (4) Former players in the social A division organized by the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (before 2008) or non-basketball professional athletes. (5) Athletes who have been selected for national (or regional) representative teams in various competition categories during their time in high school, except for those participating in disabled sports competitions who do not fall under the restrictions of the first to fourth items of this article, may participate in the General Division. (6) Athletes who have participated in championships or internationally recognized competitions organized by international sports federations or have international rankings recognized by international sports federations during their time in high school. (7) Athletes who have achieved the top eight in national sports events, national secondary school sports events, or the designated cup competitions for college admission counseling by the Ministry of Education during their time in high school.</p>"},{"location":"20230925091222119533/","title":"The Taichung Sun issued a statement protesting against the decision of the T1 League","text":"<p>The Taichung Sun issued a statement protesting against the decision of the T1 League.</p> <p>Earlier today, the T1 League announced that the Taichung Sun would not be participating in the 2023-2024 season, citing multiple reviews by the T1 League Executive Council that found the team's financial practices to be in violation of the league's regulations.

Just when we thought the \"double contract incident\" was about to cool down as it entered the judicial process, the Taiwan New Ball Club held a press conference using a \"no interview\" scripted approach, challenging the understanding of fans and journalists. For details, you can search for the guest Xiaotie's analysis article on the \"double contract incident,\" which is logically clear and unbiased towards any party, so I won't go into detail about the incident.</p> <p>But regarding the press conference, I was disappointed. Even though we know that the apology statement was probably prepared by the team, the behavior of the players reading from the script and stumbling over words, and only realizing that they hadn't finished reading the script after being reminded by a lawyer, indeed lacked the sincerity that the general public associates with an \"apology.\" After the conference, they refused to answer questions from journalists, claiming it was not an open Q&amp;A session. If they didn't plan on answering questions in the first place, they didn't need to go through the trouble of holding a press conference. The team could have simply issued a statement or filmed an apology video. As the case enters the judicial process, both sides may present \"partial facts\" from a position that benefits themselves. Regardless of whether it is Hsinchu or Taiwan New, the information currently released is advantageous to their own side. However, Taiwan New still does not want to face the negative public perception. Instead, they have a mentality of burying their heads in the sand and treating all negative accusations as the work of Hsinchu's \"internet army.\" But is it really the case? Are all those who booed Lin Ping-Hsuan at the game Lions fans? Are all those criticizing this incident online writers for the Hsinchu Kominga Lions? This judgment is left for the fans and netizens to decide.</p> <p>Please continue reading. As for the recent buzz about the \"New League,\" whether it is about which boss is not aligned with whom, or the excessive spotlight on \"that man,\" which made the paying teams feel uncomfortable, or the desire to unite and exclude/cut off a certain team, what I see is not the form in which the New League will appear, but rather the purpose of operating a professional sports business. Looking back at the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) established in 1989, it was initially started by the Hung brothers, who brought together Uni-President, Wei Chuan, and Tainan Enterprises to establish a professional baseball league. Before that, there were no professional athletes in Taiwan, and most baseball players came from existing amateur teams such as Taiwan Power, Rong-Bin, Brother, Heslink, and Chinese Petroleum. There were also many players who had played for Japanese teams and returned to Taiwan after the establishment of the CPBL. In the early stages of the league's establishment, the Hung brothers took on key roles in league operations. However, as time went on, they inevitably faced gossip and speculation, so the Hung brothers eventually ended their roles in league operations and focused on managing their teams.</p> <p>Over the years, the CPBL has also experienced ups and downs. As someone who has been watching since before the first game-fixing scandal, I have personally witnessed games at the crowded Taipei Municipal Baseball Stadium and at the Tianmu Baseball Stadium with less than 1,000 people in the stands, where some fans near the outfield displayed slogans related to the game-fixing scandal. Nowadays, professional baseball in Taiwan has gradually developed its own characteristics, and each team has a stable fan base and various themed events. Over the past thirty years, these team owners have managed professional baseball teams not just to be the top team or to make a lot of money. The Hung family, who initially ran small and medium-sized businesses in trading and hospitality, required both the bosses and employees to play baseball together. Although they later sold the team to Chinatrust, they still have a lifelong passion for the sport. Liu Baoyou, the former owner of Lamigo, once said, \"There's nothing I can do. I fell in love with it.\" This sentiment summed up the bittersweet journey of managing LaNew to Lamigo for 16 years, despite facing annual losses.</p> <p>I'm not saying that professional sports teams shouldn't make money. Instead, I would like to quote a statement from a great sports commentator: this is an industry that needs dreams and sells dreams. The passion, ideals, and imagination of those involved in the industry may determine the direction and future of professional sports. When P.LEAGUE+ (P+) was successful in its first year, it was due to favorable timing, conditions, and people. Being forced to stay in Taiwan due to the pandemic and with limited entertainment options, the ABL games couldn't take place, and the two teams that were supposed to participate in the ABL became part of the P+ league. With basketball stars like the Golden Generation leading the way, targeting fans with a sense of nostalgia, this particular audience consists of people who are either settled in their careers or have been in society for a while, and they certainly have purchasing power.</p> <p>The atmosphere created in the first season was not just about basketball games; it provided a blueprint for the future of professional basketball in Taiwan. It seemed to bring hope to basketball development, which had stagnated since the late stage of the SBL. But now, as the P.LEAGUE+ enters its fourth year, have we established a solid foundation? The sports industry is an industry that carries multiple dreams and requires more \"fools\" who are passionate about the sport. Returning to the essence of watching sports, when we see athletes giving their all for victory or to surpass themselves, as spectators, we can also feel their dedication. Why did the SBL lose its popularity while the HBL continues to thrive? Is it because high school basketball games are more entertaining? Or is it because, despite the lack of technical maturity, the spirit of never giving up until the last second has inspired us in the stands? When fans enter the arena or turn on the TV to watch a sports game, what they hope to experience is a sense of inspiration and hope. We have all been moved by a game, felt joy for a victory, or lamented a defeat. It is the players' relentless effort that not only allows us to appreciate the game but also inspires and heals us. These memories are deep and meaningful, as the band Fire Extinguisher wrote in the lyrics of their song \"Once Crazy\": \"We will always remember you standing in front, the white frame on the red clay forever preserving your footsteps.\" Even if the player has left the field, our memories will be awakened every time we step into the same arena. Here, I want to tell a story that echoes the title. It is from a TV series I really like called \"Designated Survivor.\" In one scene (if you don't want spoilers, please skip this paragraph), when the main character is accused of taking a negative term, \"fool,\" out of context, it sparks a series of PR crises. But when he explains the meaning of the term, he says, \"I believe in a lot of 'fools' in America because they believe in the 'American Dream.' Despite the difficult circumstances, they still believe in a better future and dreams that are within reach, and they work tirelessly towards it.\" The sports industry is the same. We need not only fans but also operators who are passionate about this professional sport. No matter how challenging the situation may be, they still believe in and love this sport. Taiwanese basketball is just getting started. Japan took 18 years from 2006 to make it to the Olympics. Although Taiwan's ranking is falling behind, it also means that we have a lot of room for improvement. Let's keep going!

With a talented lineup consisting of Brogdon, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, and Kristaps Porzingis, the Celtics are still considered strong contenders for the championship. If they can stay healthy and consistent, they will be a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>The third team is the New York Knicks, representing the Big Apple. Last offseason, the Knicks signed Jalen Brunson for a four-year, $100 million contract. Initially, many doubted this signing, considering it an overpriced deal. However, Brunson quickly proved himself, showcasing his skills from his time with the Dallas Mavericks. With Brunson on board, the Knicks' main star, Julius Randle, no longer has to shoulder as much ball-handling responsibility. This allows Randle to focus on scoring, leading to increased efficiency this season. Quentin Grimes has also shown great performance on defense and three-point shooting, helping the Knicks secure a playoff spot. With Brunson, Randle, and RJ Barrett as the offensive core, supported by a roster of talented players, the Knicks have the potential to make a deeper playoff run in the upcoming season.</p> <p>The fourth team is the Brooklyn Nets, the neighbors of the New York Knicks. In the 2020-21 season, the Nets were considered the most likely team in the Eastern Conference to win the championship. They boasted star players such as Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Kyrie Irving. However, due to various factors and limited playing time together, their championship aspirations quickly faded. With the departure of the three stars, the Nets' star power decreased significantly. Nevertheless, the Nets acquired valuable assets in exchange for these players, such as Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, Dorian Finney Smith, and Ben Simmons. Mikal Bridges, in particular, has shown impressive performances despite an increased workload. Alongside Cam Thomas, who had a breakout season, and Nicolas Claxton, a candidate for the best defensive player, the Nets still possess a certain level of competitiveness. The author hopes that their new head coach, Jacque Vaughn, can lead the team to the playoffs, considering the talent they have.</p> <p>Lastly, we have the Toronto Raptors, a team that has had success in recent seasons.

The team won their first game against New Zealand 99-72 in the 2023 FIBA World Cup and continued to secure victories in subsequent matches.</p> <p>It is widely known that this team is filled with promising young talents but lacks veteran players. Only three players from the roster, Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton, and Jaren Jackson Jr., were selected for last year's All-Star game.</p> <p>Furthermore, while Jaren Jackson Jr. won the Defensive Player of the Year award and Paolo Banchero won the Rookie of the Year award, none of them made it to the NBA All-League Team. The crucial reason why star players are important for the US team is that these young players have not experienced many big moments.</p> <p>Among the entire team, only Bobby Portis, Mikal Bridges, and Cameron Johnson have been to the NBA Finals. This lack of experience raises questions about whether these players can step up in important moments. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Additionally, none of the players on the US team roster have been selected for the NBA All-League Team. This makes it intriguing to think about how the performance of the US team will develop.</p> <p>The US team has seven players who averaged at least 32 minutes of playing time per game in the 2022-23 season, giving them a significant depth advantage compared to other teams. However, they lack the superstar players who can lead the team.</p> <p>According to the statistical data from the SCHOENE projection system and NBAshotcharts.com adjustments, the US team has a chance to win over 52 games in the NBA. Only four teams achieved such a record last season.</p> <p>Although these statistics are conservative in nature, based on the current roster and projected playing time, only the Boston Celtics (54.6) are expected to have more average wins than the US team. With such strong depth, the US team also has the best offensive forecast, scoring over 4 points per 100 possessions above the league average. The Celtics, under the same conditions, have only +3.6.</p> <p>Despite having the Defensive Player of the Year in Jaren Jackson Jr., the US team's defense is only slightly above average due to a lack of other interior players.</p> <p>So far, Kerr has used Banchero as the primary backup for Jaren Jackson Jr., focusing on mobility and defensive versatility. These aspects are not as crucial in the NBA regular season, so adjusting the playing time of Banchero and Kessler will be one of the strategies to improve the US team's defense. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Comparing to the performance in the 2019 World Cup, where the US team finished seventh, it was the worst performance ever for the team in a major tournament.</p> <p>Interestingly, the 2019 team had higher ratings when entering the tournament, with an average projected win count of 56.4, surpassing any team in the 2019-20 NBA season.</p> <p>Looking back, the concerns about the lack of star players on the US team that year seem laughable. Three players from that roster, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Donovan Mitchell, were selected for the NBA All-League Team in the 2022-23 season, with Tatum and Mitchell ranking fourth and sixth in the MVP voting.</p> <p>Of course, these players had not become superstars at that time. But perhaps in the future, we may look back on this year's young core players in a similar way. Please continue reading.</p> <p>One of the reasons for the underperformance of the US team in 2019 was Tatum's ankle injury during the early stages of the group stage, and Marcus Smart's absence from two games due to hand soreness, which greatly affected the team's perimeter depth.</p> <p>Most importantly, the 2019 US team had not found the chemistry needed to effectively suppress opponents. If Kerr and the coaching staff can find a reasonable rotation lineup and execute it well, it should pay off during the World Cup. However, compared to other countries with long-term training programs, the US team often rushes to assemble their team for such tournaments, which raises concerns for this year's World Cup.

Jalen Brunson, NBA player, has the nickname \"Big Headson\" among Taiwanese fans. Recently, a fan group dedicated to the New York Knicks discussed Brunson's performance last year and concluded that Brunson is our king. This drew a response from Josh Hart, who jokingly remarked that Brunson has a big head and would need a large crown to wear. The Big Knick Energy fan page posted a message on X, stating that last year people said Brunson was overpaid, but now they see that his contract of approximately $40 million is a very good signing. Brunson is the king of our team! Unexpectedly, Josh Hart replied with a comment saying that if Brunson is a king, you need to prepare a very big crown for him because his head is so big. Last season, Hart joined the Knicks through a trade and reunited with his college teammate Brunson. During this time, they have shown a good relationship, often teasing each other on social media.

If this 2023 draft pick lives up to expectations, Gregg Popovich and Brian Wright will build the team around him with players that suit his style.</p> <p>The first step in this process is finding the right starting lineup for him. It's no secret that Wembanyama is likely to play power forward, which means someone from last year's roster, apart from Zach Collins, will have to make way. The obvious answer is the player who occupied that position last season, Jeremy Sochan, but his uniqueness complicates things in a positive way.</p> <p>Is Sochan really a power forward? Technically, yes, but some players break the outdated position definitions, and he is one of them. Part of it is due to his performance, and part of it is how the Spurs utilize him. As the team is in a rebuilding phase and not overly concerned about winning, they have given this rookie the freedom to find his own direction in the league and experiment with his role. Sochan has defended many forwards and other players of similar build, but he has also spent a significant amount of time defending guards, and not just because of the team's defensive system.</p> <p>The same situation applies to offense. Sochan sometimes takes the initiative, while other times he operates closer to the basket. Coach Popovich clearly wants to see if Sochan is versatile and can be \"more than just\" a traditional power forward.</p> <p>To his credit, Sochan has performed well in various aspects, especially considering his lack of experience.</p> <p>The question is whether he can be a \"Swiss Army Knife\" player who cannot be categorized throughout his career, or if he needs to stop doing what he can do and focus on excelling at what he's good at. This is not an urgent question in general, but with Wembanyama's arrival and his expected position as the starting power forward, it becomes crucial whether Sochan can handle the small forward role or become a player suitable for any position.</p> <p>Before discussing specific skills, being versatile is an advantage, and having multiple skills also makes him a better fit as the Spurs' second option in the future. Can Sochan complement the future team center, Wembanyama, when they share the court? He should be able to handle defense, as mentioned earlier, being able to defend wings and guards, and he can also shoulder the toughest tasks as a forward, allowing Wembanyama to roam and provide help defense.</p> <p>As for his rebounding, even though his numbers may be affected by the presence of two tall players, it can still benefit him as it allows him to initiate fast breaks. However, his fit with the team remains a big question mark, as Sochan lacks reliable shooting ability, which may complicate things in half-court situations. Sochan takes free throws in a completely non-traditional way - one-handed - which has improved his free throw percentage from 59% in college to 70%, but his three-point shooting percentage is only 24%, lower than his 29% in college.</p> <p>Perhaps Sochan can become a sharpshooter despite his struggles, but overall, he is not a natural shooter, which could be a concern as Wembanyama is currently inconsistent in shooting and needs some space when attempting his own shots.</p> <p>Of course, it is unfair to overly focus on what Sochan cannot do. Even as a rookie, he has shown that he can punish smaller players in the backcourt and penetrate through taller opponents. Whether Sochan faces a forward or a guard, he can create advantages elsewhere or exploit defensive mismatches.</p> <p>Since Sochan already has the mindset of a role player and glue guy, continuing to play a supporting role should not be difficult for him. Having Sochan alongside Wembanyama may provide some advantages. However, can these advantages outweigh the benefits of having Keldon Johnson as the traditional small forward? Johnson's scoring ability, emerging playmaking skills, and inconsistent but continuously improving three-point shooting make him a better fit for the young Wembanyama. On the contrary, what is best for the team may not be as important, and although Sochan's career started as a power forward, he could also transition to the perimeter like Johnson over time, but there is a risk that this may not come true.</p> <p>The arrival of Wembanyama is undoubtedly a good thing for the Spurs, but a secondary issue arises - how to utilize a rookie power forward who has shown excellent performance and significant two-way potential.</p> <p>Sochan could potentially play at both forward positions next season (or even as a guard if Coach Popovich wants to experiment), so there is no need to make any extreme decisions now. However, Sochan must quickly prove that he can be effective alongside Wembanyama or excel in the role of the sixth man.</p>"},{"location":"20230926091357565744/","title":"PLG202324 Preseason Warm-up Match 10071009 Kick-off in Keelung","text":"<p>PLG Preseason Warm-up Match    PLG202324 Preseason Warm-up Match 10071009 Kick-off in Keelung</p> <p>PLG Preseason Warm-up Match.</p> <p>Today (09/08), PLG P.

With the first offseason under the revised agreement, the league's landscape and operations have undergone significant changes    Discussing the Winners and Losers of the NBA's New Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) in its First Offseason</p> <p>The new version of the NBA's Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) officially took effect on July 1st! With the first offseason under the revised agreement, the league's landscape and operations have undergone significant changes. As we take a moment to reflect on the first offseason under the new CBA, let's discuss the alterations and who has benefited or suffered from them. Is it the end of superteams?</p> <p>As mentioned in my previous article at the end of June, with the implementation of the second Apron (Super Tax), many powerhouse teams were unable to escape the fate of salary clearing. For example, the Warriors traded Jordan Poole, the Clippers let go of Eric Gordon, and the Hawks sold John Collins. The Suns, on the other hand, demonstrated a completely different approach by trading for Wizards' star Bradley Beal before the new CBA took effect, maximizing their cap space. This may be the last super-team in the NBA for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Read more: Beal, CP3 Trade Only the Beginning! The New CBA Will Bring a Big Storm to the NBA Superteams, Will the Free Agency Market Be Quieter? Exploring the Major Changes in the New CBA Under the new CBA, once a team's total salary exceeds the second Apron, they are unable to use the mid-level exception or sign-and-trade deals. The flexibility in trade amounts will also be restricted, and the future first-round draft picks will automatically become the 30th pick. The cost of building a team will be much higher than just the luxury tax. While it may be worth taking risks in the short term to compete for a championship, it will be challenging to sustain a roster with three superstars (accounting for over 30% of the salary cap) in the long run. Take the Suns, for example. In the upcoming season, Kevin Durant and Beal's salaries will account for approximately 35% of the cap, while Devin Booker's will be 26%. However, starting from the 2024-25 season, when the new contracts come into effect, their salaries will increase to approximately 35%, meaning the three Suns players will eat up around 105% of the salary cap, which is a significant burden.</p> <p>Looking purely at salaries, Deandre Ayton will likely become a player that needs to be traded due to his contract. I believe the Suns won't be able to maintain a three-superstar lineup for long and will have to face the reality in the near future. The Timberwolves will be the next team to face a salary crisis. They recently signed Anthony Edwards to a five-year, $259 million extension that will come into effect starting from the 2024-25 season. Combined with Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert's contracts, they will eat up 90% of the salary cap. Unless the Timberwolves can quickly develop and prove that the twin towers are a championship-caliber configuration, they will soon face the penalties of the second Apron.</p> <p>The already salary-heavy Clippers will need to make decisions in the new season to alleviate their salary pressure. They will need to accelerate the turnover of their expensive veteran players like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, whether by re-signing or breaking up the team.</p> <p>This year and the next will be a transitional period for powerhouse teams, as they will need to slow down and adjust their rosters. They won't be able to strengthen their lineups through free agency using their cap space. Teams like the Suns, Timberwolves, Warriors, or Clippers may find more suitable role players through trades, but it will be challenging to sustain the current salary cap for a long time. If they don't trade away high-salary players, they will have to face rebuilding.</p> <p>However, there's no need to worry. I believe that NBA executives, known for their gambling nature, will still find a way to assemble a super-team. But if they fail to win a championship, it will likely be a more painful experience than before. The more flexible trading and signing exceptions in the new CBA will benefit teams with limited financial resources. Many trading restrictions have been relaxed, and more exceptions have been introduced. As long as the team's total salary is below the two Aprons, they can expand the range of \"salary matching\" required for trades.</p> <p>The first beneficiary is the Cavaliers, who saved up to $7.5 million in price difference to complete the sign-and-trade deal for Max Strus (4 years, $63 million). Under the old rules, the Cavaliers would have had to offer a larger and more expensive contract to the Heat. The Rockets also benefited from this new rule when they signed Dillon Brooks.</p> <p>Second-round rookies now have their own exception to use. Unlike first-round rookies with standard contracts, second-round rookies previously had to use their salary cap space or split mid-level exceptions to sign 3-4 year contracts. The new second-round exception clause solves this problem.</p> <p>The Kings used this exception to sign Colby Jones, the 34th pick, to a 4-year, $8.76 million contract. The Hawks also signed Mouhamed Gueye, the 39th pick, to a 4-year, $7.63 million contract, with a team option for the final year. This is seen as a way to prevent a repeat of the \"Jalen Brunson situation,\" where players become restricted free agents and have the right to receive offers instead of being forced to stay with their current team, as the Mavericks experienced. In 2021, the Nuggets signed Michael Porter Jr. to a designated rookie contract extension worth $179.29 million over 5 years, sparking a debate. The new version of the CBA removed the limit on designated players and opened up the possibility for first-round rookies to sign 5-year contracts without any conditions.</p> <p>As a result, we saw Desmond Bane of the Grizzlies sign a 5-year, $197.23 million contract, slightly below the 25% max contract, but still securing a long-term deal.</p> <p>This is a sign that the NBA is encouraging drafting and developing young players. Teams have more incentives and conditions to keep their young players. Being a restricted free agent puts players at a disadvantage as their teams have the right to match any offer. This reduces their bargaining power, especially when they become restricted free agents. We witnessed this with Deandre Ayton last year, and this year, P.J. Washington and Austin Reaves entered the market as restricted free agents but chose to accept new contracts from their current teams instead of receiving offers from other teams.</p> <p>According to rumors, the Spurs initially planned to offer Reaves a contract worth $100 million over 4 years or $60 million over 3 years. When they heard that the Lakers were interested, they didn't even make an offer, and Reaves ended up signing a 4-year, $56 million contract with the Lakers.</p> <p>Washington, on the other hand, waited for offers from other teams but ended up with no options and chose to sign a 3-year, $48 million contract with the Hornets. The problem lies not in Washington and Reaves' reasonable contract demands but in the weakened bargaining power of restricted free agents.</p> <p>Since the team has the right to match any contract, teams interested in a player would need to offer a slightly higher contract to deter the player's current team from matching it. In Washington's case, some teams may have thought it was not worth it.</p> <p>If a player is attractive enough, like Reaves, who had interest from the Lakers, why would other teams waste their time? Going back and forth to become a restricted free agent usually doesn't result in the ideal contract value. Washington and Reaves, for example, could have chosen to accept the qualifying offer (QO) and become unrestricted free agents after one more year, but that would come with the risk of entering the free agency market.</p> <p>An interesting exception is that restricted free agents can also be used as a way to troll other teams. The Jazz offered a three-year, $23 million contract to the 76ers' backup center Paul Reed, including a rare condition. The first season is fully guaranteed, but if the team reaches the second round of the playoffs, the next two years will also be fully guaranteed. It's unlikely that the rebuilding Jazz will meet this condition, but the 76ers have a higher chance of making it to the second round.</p> <p>Read more: From the Suns and Deandre Ayton Contract Dispute, a Glimpse into the Awkward Situation of Restricted Free Agents A Quiet Free Agency Market The free agency market has been relatively quiet, excluding re-signings. Only four players, Max Strus, Bruce Brown Jr., Fred VanVleet, and Dillon Brooks, have received new contracts that exceed the full mid-level exception. If we exclude Strus, there are only about 7-10 teams that can clear enough cap space to sign players to multi-million-dollar contracts. Among them, only the Pacers and Rockets are willing to spend.</p> <p>When we examine the strategies of these two teams, it becomes clear that they are not truly strengthening their roster but rather focusing on reaching the salary floor. The contracts for Brown Jr. and VanVleet also include team-friendly options.</p> <p>The new CBA's rules clearly encourage trades and raise the conditions for re-signing. When players can earn a significant amount by staying with their current team, more players will be willing to sign contract extensions early, leading to a decrease in the number of players entering free agency. Consequently, many teams' salary cap space has already been filled before the offseason even began.</p> <p>Since 2018 and 2019, apart from Fred VanVleet this year, the last players who secured max contracts in free agency using cap space were Kawhi Leonard in 2019 and LeBron James in 2018. Most players have had to go through trades or re-signings. </p> <p>Read more: The NBA Free Agency Game Has Changed! Don't Expect \"Salary Space\" Big Buyers This Summer A notable requirement in the new CBA is that teams must reach the salary floor on the first day of the season to be eligible for the luxury tax distribution. This has put pressure on teams to spend money during the offseason. While teams like the Pacers and Rockets have handed out premium contracts, many rebuilding teams have filled their cap space through trades and invested in some functional veterans.</p> <p>For example, the Pistons traded for Monte Morris and Joe Harris, the Spurs acquired Reggie Bullock from the Mavericks. Though their main goal is to meet the salary floor requirements or to focus on future trades, they have acquired valuable role players, which gives rebuilding teams a better chance to compete.</p> <p>Compared to the past, where teams preferred to have cap space for big experiments, this offseason has shown that many rebuilding teams have made significant progress, providing young players with better development opportunities and making the games more exciting.</p>"},{"location":"20230926091530847490/","title":"Steve Kerr discusses starting lineup options for the upcoming NBA season, emphasizing the need for each player to accept their role","text":"<p>Steve Kerr discusses starting lineup options for the upcoming NBA season, emphasizing the need for each player to accept their role.</p> <p>As the NBA season approaches, the Warriors' lineup configuration has become a topic of discussion.

In addition, they also brought in 7-foot backup center Jaxson Hayes.</p> <p>27-year-old Wood is the seventh new face to join the Lakers after last season.</p> <p>Although the Lakers made it to the Western Conference Finals last season, their surprising journey ended with the Denver Nuggets.</p> <p>Despite losing some key players, including Dennis Schroder, who was the Most Valuable Player of the World Cup, Lonnie Walker IV, who had notable performances in the playoffs, versatile Troy Brown Jr., and reliable big man Wenyen Gabriel, the Lakers' strength seems to have increased rather than decreased with their core players remaining.</p> <p>Managing the team this summer was quite challenging for Pelinka and the Lakers, as they only had a $4.5 million biannual exception, a $12.4 million mid-level exception, and some veteran minimum contracts to offer.</p> <p>The highlight of the Lakers' offseason was signing Wood, showcasing a different approach compared to the past few years. They didn't repeat the complete overhaul of the roster like the 2020-21 season or focus solely on the fame and achievements of young players for the 2021-22 season. Instead, they emphasized team fit, athleticism, and didn't insist on assembling a \"Big Three\" lineup like last season.</p> <p>Considering the team's style, the Lakers signed new members who should be able to integrate into Darvin Ham's defensive mentality. These players include Gabe Vincent from the Miami Heat and Taurean Prince, who joined from the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Lakers took a gamble on some promising young players this year, including Wood, Hayes, and Cam Reddish. They also addressed their shooting deficiencies from last season by acquiring accurate shooters such as Vincent, who had a 43% three-point shooting percentage in the playoffs, and Prince, who maintained a high level of 38.1% shooting from beyond the arc. Rookie D'Moi Hodge also had a 40% three-point shooting percentage during his college career at the University of Missouri.</p> <p>Additionally, the Lakers signed contracts with two rookies, Jalen Hood-Schifino and Maxwell Lewis. However, these signings were overshadowed by other moves. Ultimately, the Lakers sealed a two-year, $5.7 million contract with Wood, with a player option for the second year. Nevertheless, retaining their core players was more important than any other acquisitions. In order to keep their legendary Hall of Famers in Los Angeles, the Lakers re-signed their trio of young players: Austin Reaves (4 years, $56 million), D'Angelo Russell (2 years, $37 million), and Rui Hachimura (3 years, $51 million). These three players played a crucial role in the Lakers' late-season surge last year, contributing to an 18-6 record, including the playoffs and the first two rounds. Along with LeBron James entering his 21st year, the Lakers' new season remains promising.</p> <p>Wood, who averaged 16.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, and a 37.6% three-point shooting percentage last season, has the potential to be the biggest steal of this offseason. He is likely to follow in the footsteps of Malik Monk or Schroder and re-establish his reputation in one of the most spotlighted teams in the league, possibly earning himself a lucrative contract in the future. Furthermore, if James or Davis were to suffer injuries, Wood would have more opportunities and a more prominent role. However, this trade still carries some concerns. According to advanced statistics, Wood had the worst individual defensive rating among the Lakers' reserves last season. If he fails to find his place in the Lakers' system, the purple and gold army, with ambitions of winning their 18th championship, may not have the patience to wait for him to adapt.</p>"},{"location":"20230926091619691306/","title":"The second half of the interleague invitation tournament was chaotic as Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors suffered a second consecutive loss to Taiwan Bank","text":"<p>The second half of the interleague invitation tournament was chaotic as Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors suffered a second consecutive loss to Taiwan Bank.</p> <p>In the interleague invitation tournament, today's match between Taipei Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors and Taiwan Bank was closely contested in the first half, with both teams exchanging attacks and defenses.

Both Pan and the woman were ordered to pay NT$300,000 in compensation to Pan's wife. His wife then filed for divorce and requested an additional NT$500,000 in compensation. The Taipei District Court granted the divorce and ordered Pan to pay an additional NT$200,000. The case is appealable.</p> <p>Pan Guanhan, a former player for the Hsinchu Street Attack Lions, was previously exposed for having an affair with a female fan and attempting to force his wife and child out of their home. After the news came to light, the team immediately announced his release. Pan's model wife also filed a lawsuit, seeking joint compensation of NT$500,000 from Pan and the female fan. In the first trial at the Taipei District Court, they were ordered to pay NT$250,000. However, in the second trial, the panel considered the extramarital affair between Pan and the female fan to be a genuine violation of their marriage, and the compensation was increased to NT$300,000.</p> <p>Pan Guanhan's wife is a pharmacist and also works as a model. She claimed that they got married in March 2018, but Pan started dating the female fan in February 2021.

Furthermore, Pan had been traveling between Taipei and Hsinchu for a long time to support his wife's social media career. His wife had previously requested a divorce multiple times, and their marriage had long been in name only.</p> <p>Pan Guanhan admitted to having sexual relations with someone else but stated that he and his wife had grown apart a long time ago, and their marriage was already deteriorating. He also believed that his wife had faults. Moreover, he had already been ordered to pay NT$300,000 in compensation to his wife and the female fan, and his wife could not demand further compensation.</p> <p>Pan Guanhan agreed to the divorce, but he saw no reason for his wife's additional compensation request. The Taipei District Court acknowledged that Pan and the female fan had engaged in sexual activities that infringed upon the rights of the spouse, and compensation had already been ordered in a separate case. Therefore, the court granted the divorce. The court also recognized that Pan had consensual sexual intercourse with other individuals, which made it impossible for his wife to maintain the marriage, causing her significant mental distress.</p> <p>Pan Guanhan's wife also revealed his current situation. He currently co-owns a barbecue snack shop with friends, earning around NT$50,000 to NT$60,000 per month.

According to The Washington Post, the female members of the Western Springs Association Football Club in New Zealand recently reached an agreement with management to increase their salaries and resources to be on par with their male counterparts. The ninth FIFA Women's World Cup, co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia, is also set to kick off in New Zealand on July 20.</p> <p>Pip Meo, a former member of the New Zealand national team and advocate for gender pay equality, emphasized that the fight for equal pay is not just about salaries but also about the value of women's sports and sending a positive message to young girls who aspire to play football.</p> <p>Meo added, \"We cannot celebrate yet because we have to see how this deal plays out. We have only gotten what we deserve.\"</p> <p>The Washington Post reported that while New Zealand's global image has been improving, its football industry has long struggled with unequal pay and resource distribution between men and women. Most football clubs in New Zealand are amateur clubs run by volunteers, and the maximum salary players can receive is around $94 per week, as regulated by the national soccer federation.</p> <p>However, the equal distribution of wages among clubs has not been a government priority. In the New Zealand football scene, women receive lower salaries, fewer training opportunities, and less access to facilities and coaching staff compared to men. Women's teams usually have only one coach, while men's teams have several.</p> <p>In 2022, members of the Manukau United football team in New Zealand initiated a campaign for equal pay and resources for men and women but ultimately failed. Maia Jackman, a team member, stated, \"Many women on different teams would speak up for themselves but would then face setbacks and give up. However, the people at Western Springs are different; they have consistently stood their ground and never backed down.\"</p> <p>In 2023, Meo and Jackman joined the predominantly male board of directors at the Western Springs Association in another attempt to achieve gender equality in football. After two months of negotiations, a 12-hour marathon mediation session, and the threat of a strike, they reached an agreement with club management to achieve gender equality.</p> <p>The club subsequently issued a statement acknowledging past shortcomings and apologizing for them. Regarding the successful negotiation, Meo responded that the new agreement has not yet been officially implemented, so they cannot celebrate too early. Jackman stated, \"Ultimately, we just want to play football without any limitations or concerns.\" She added that her focus will now be on the World Cup, hoping to showcase the charm of women's football through the tournament.</p> <p>According to reports from CBS and Lexology, gender pay inequality exists in many sports worldwide. For example, in basketball, the average annual income of male NBA players in the US is $5.3 million, with star players earning significantly more. For instance, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant had annual salaries of $45.7 million and $42 million respectively last year.</p> <p>In contrast, the average annual income of WNBA players in the US is only $130,000, and the highest-earning player in the league makes $230,000 per year.</p> <p>However, the reports also point out that the main reason for the wage gap between men and women in sports is the lower popularity and resulting lower revenue and ticket sales of women's sports. The NBA generated approximately $10 billion in revenue last season, while the WNBA only generated $60 million.</p> <p>In the case of American football, the US women's national team has generated more revenue and attracted more viewers than the men's team since 2019. However, until last year, their income and winning bonuses were still lower than those of male players. Lexology suggests that the most effective way to promote gender equality in sports is to increase the promotion of women's sports. This includes encouraging media advertising of female athletes and encouraging companies to invest in women's sports and athletes through commercial partnerships and sponsorships. This would garner more attention for female athletes, increase ticket sales, and contribute to achieving gender pay equality.</p> <p>Note: The author of this article has been removed, as requested.</p>"},{"location":"20230927091350789523/","title":"The video turned the basketball court into a fairground","text":"<p>The video turned the basketball court into a fairground.

Since then, he had only returned to the country once. However, in a different sense, he never felt like he left.</p> <p>Engelland is currently the shooting coach for the USA team in the World Cup. He is not surprised that fans recognize him from the sidelines, as even in the United States, many Filipino-Americans would approach him on the streets for photos. \"If it's like this in the United States, I can imagine that even more people would recognize me in the Philippines,\" Engelland said.</p> <p>\"I haven't played on the court for almost 40 years, and yet I can still be recognized in the United States. The Filipino fans are really great. I once met a few passionate fans in Las Vegas, and we sat down and chatted about PBA and the country we miss,\" Engelland continued. This signifies the indelible imprint Engelland left in the Philippine basketball scene. Engelland may be the best pure shooter in the history of PBA. After graduating from Duke University, he came to the Philippines to play in the PBA. He played in 76 games in three PBA cups, averaging 27.5 points per game, with a record high of 60 points in a single game. His accurate shooting earned him the nickname \"Machine Gun\" from Filipino fans.</p> <p>Engelland was also a member of the famous Northern Consolidated Corporation (NCC) in the 1980s. NCC was a team assigned by then Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to participate in international tournaments, with Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco, the owner of Northern Consolidated Corporation, serving as the national team director.</p> <p>The team trained together for several months and essentially became a club team not affiliated with any league. It included four naturalized players, including Engelland. In 1982, they helped the Philippines secure fourth place in the Asian Games held in India. In 1985, NCC won the Asian Championship in Kuala Lumpur and earned the right to participate in the 1986 FIBA World Championship in Spain. They also won the William Jones Cup in 1985, defeating the representative team from Purdue University. Engelland scored 43 points in that game, saying, \"Without Jeff Moore and Dennis Still, we wouldn't have won the Jones Cup. We were a versatile and strong team with great chemistry, and we still keep in touch.\"</p> <p>These achievements representing the Philippines are reasons that Filipinos and Filipino-Americans proudly talk about. \"Basketball is the national sport in the Philippines, and our performance in international tournaments allowed many fans to see us,\" Engelland explained.</p> <p>After the conclusion of the NCC project in 1986, Engelland returned to the United States. He played in several minor leagues before retiring and transitioning to become a shooting coach. He organized camps and served as a personal training consultant for players. He earned the nickname \"Shot Doctor\" and counted current USA team head coach Steve Kerr and general manager Grant Hill among his clients.</p> <p>In the 1999-2000 season, Engelland joined the Detroit Pistons as an assistant shooting coach. Three years later, he became the director of player development for the Denver Nuggets. He then spent 17 years as an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs, helping them win two NBA championships. Players like Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, and Dejounte Murray broke through their ceilings under his guidance. Engelland is widely recognized as one of the top assistant coaches in the NBA. Kerr had always wanted to bring him on board as a shooting coach for the Golden State Warriors, but their collaboration eventually happened on the national team.</p> <p>Engelland is now a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder, preparing to develop a group of talented young players such as Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. This includes current Canadian and Australian national team mainstays and highly cultivated Thunder players Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey. Giddey highly regards Engelland's guidance, saying, \"Since Engelland joined, I've been practicing shooting with him almost every day, 2 to 3 times. I spend a lot of time receiving his instructions. He's truly a genius.\"</p> <p>Engelland briefly mentioned his two proteges, saying, \"With SGA and Josh, Canada and Australia are definitely formidable obstacles for us to win the championship. They have proven themselves in the NBA.\" However, due to the busy schedule and his main focus on helping the USA team win the championship, Engelland hasn't had many opportunities to watch the current Philippine national team games. \"I spend a lot of time studying opponents and assisting USA team players, but I know they have many competitive games,\" he added.</p> <p>It has been 17 years since Engelland last visited the Philippines, and his stay this time is only for a few days. As he tries to reconnect with the city he once called home, Engelland mentioned, \"There are many places I no longer recognize.

But I'm enjoying my stay this time.\" Engelland also mentioned that due to the busy schedule, his main task is to help the USA team win the championship, so he hasn't had many opportunities to watch the current Philippine national team games. \"I spend a lot of time studying opponents and assisting USA team players, but I know they have many competitive games,\" he added.</p>"},{"location":"20230927091451281705/","title":"The World Cup is over and Serbia has advanced to the championship game after defeating Canada in the semifinals","text":"<p>The World Cup is over and Serbia has advanced to the championship game after defeating Canada in the semifinals.

Their fierce playing style and never-give-up spirit have delighted fans, but little is known about the hidden secrets of the Grizzlies' home court network and communication equipment. The tale of the resilient Grizzlies, born out of the tragedy of Vancouver, Canada, began in 1995.</p> <p>Compared to the Toronto Raptors, another Canadian team that entered the league around the same time, the Grizzlies were considered the league's punching bag due to their poor performance in the early years. The dismal record and the remote location led the management to relocate the team to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001. In their six seasons in Vancouver, the Grizzlies left with a pitiful record of 101 wins and 359 losses, with a winning percentage of only 22%. </p> <p>Continue reading below Moving to Memphis in their first year brought a breath of fresh air to the team. Not only did they move to a warm and pleasant southern city, but they also selected Spanish power forward Pau Gasol with the third overall pick in that year's draft. Gasol, who averaged 17.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 2.7 assists in his rookie season, was undoubtedly the cornerstone of the Grizzlies' hopes.</p> <p>Gasol indeed lived up to expectations, leading the team to their first playoff appearance in his third season. However, they faced tough opponents such as the Spurs, Suns, and Mavericks, and the inexperienced Grizzlies struggled to secure a single victory, suffering three consecutive first-round sweeps with a record of 0 wins and 12 losses in the playoffs.</p> <p>Unable to break through to the next level and plagued by Gasol's injuries, the team found themselves in a predicament. In the middle of the 2008 season, they traded Gasol to the Los Angeles Lakers for his younger brother, Marc Gasol, among other players.</p> <p>When Marc reported to the team before the 2008-2009 season, he was an unknown second-round rookie. No one expected him to team up with young point guard Mike Conley, who was drafted the previous year, and disgruntled forward Zach Randolph, acquired through a trade the following summer, to transform the Grizzlies into a Western Conference powerhouse.</p> <p>Starting from the 2011 season, when they created the \"Grit and Grind\" legend by defeating the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs, the Grizzlies became the team that could not be ignored in the Western Conference.</p> <p>Despite never making it past the Western Conference finals, they became the stumbling block for division champions like the Spurs, Warriors, and Thunder, who often had to go through the Grizzlies to reach the finals. Just like the blue-collar atmosphere of Memphis, the Grizzlies' playing style has always been tough, resilient, and relentless. The iron-willed Grizzlies, with their rough exterior and tender heart, have deepened the connection between the team and the local fans, especially with beloved players like Conley and Randolph. Both players are actively involved in community service, with Conley even receiving the NBA Cares Community Assist Award twice. It's not difficult to imagine the special place the Grizzlies hold in Memphis.</p> <p>As the only major professional sports team in Memphis, the organization is dedicated to building strong community relationships. They actively participate in local education, youth development, health, and fitness initiatives while also striving to enhance the fan's game-day experience.</p> <p>Since current owner Robert Pera acquired the team in 2012, his company, Ubiquiti Inc., has provided technological assistance to ensure that fans can enjoy uninterrupted internet access while watching games. From the installation of base stations to surveying and measuring signal coverage, the numerous variables make it challenging. Without careful planning and advanced network equipment, complaints about poor signal reception in crowded arenas are not uncommon. This phenomenon is frequently observed during indoor sports events, concerts, and large music festivals.</p> <p>The FedEx Forum, the Grizzlies' home court, has also faced these challenges. However, after multiple equipment iterations, Ubiquiti Inc.'s Wi-Fi devices have successfully showcased their excellent technology to the world.</p> <p>The underlying technology behind this is Ubiquiti Inc.'s UniFi Wireless BaseStation - XG (UWB-XG).

Unexpectedly, within less than two months, the Kings found a better replacement for the center position and decided to let Noel go and find a new team.

Just like how the Thunder unexpectedly acquired Paul George last year, this time it was another surprising destination that put an end to this highly anticipated drama.</p> <p>Please continue reading below as the Raptors paid a hefty price to acquire their claw (The KLAW), while the Spurs achieved their desired offer by trading away a top-five player in the league and gaining a strong addition to the team that was selected for the All-NBA Second Team this season. This calculated risk-management move is worth reading about.</p> <p>Since being swept by the Cavaliers and their head coach Dwane Casey getting fired, many analysts believed that the Raptors, who dominated the Eastern Conference this year, had reached their peak.</p> <p>Despite LeBron James' \"journey to the West,\" the rise of the 76ers and Celtics, and the Bucks and Pacers led by Antetokounmpo and Oladipo lurking in the sidelines, the Raptors, with their core entering their prime, seemed to lack future prospects compared to other competitive teams. After spending big money to re-sign Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka last year, they had locked themselves out of any future free agent signings for the next two years. For Raptors General Manager Masai Ujiri, there was no better opportunity than acquiring Kawhi Leonard, a former top-five player in the league, back-to-back MVP, and a candidate for Defensive Player of the Year just a year ago.</p> <p>If next summer, Kyle Lowry's enthusiasm and the $50 million gap can successfully convince Leonard to re-sign, his age and dominant offensive and defensive skills would undoubtedly allow the Raptors to compete against the Eastern Conference powerhouses. On the other hand, if Leonard remains determined to leave, along with Danny Green's expiring contract, the Raptors can create a salary cap space of $30 million and sell players like Lowry and Ibaka to teams with significant cap space but lacking in reinforcements, allowing them to enter a rebuilding phase ahead of schedule. Similar to last year's Thunder trading for Paul George with Victor Oladipo as the centerpiece, this trade has its gambling elements but is also reasonable.</p> <p>Let's not forget how Kawhi Leonard led the Spurs to the Western Conference Finals on his own just a year ago. Perhaps some may worry that Leonard will follow the pattern of Vince Carter seeking a trade and not giving his best effort. I believe this is an unnecessary concern. With an abundance of talent in the upcoming free agency market next year, if Leonard doesn't perform as expected and his future with the Raptors becomes uncertain due to either retaining his abilities or health issues, there are frontline players such as Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, Jimmy Butler, Khris Middleton, and Kemba Walker waiting in line. The two Los Angeles teams are not the only options for him.</p> <p>As for the speculations of boycotting or not reporting to the Raptors, they are purely fiction. Despite expressing his reluctance to play in Toronto, under the restrictions of the collective bargaining agreement, if Leonard doesn't report to the Raptors within a week, he will face severe penalties from the team and the league, citing \"harmful to league development\" as the reason. Unless Leonard is willing to pay a significant fine or even face the worst-case scenario of being expelled from the league, it is an exaggeration to describe it as \"blocking a car with his arms\" when going against an organization that earns $8 billion in annual revenue.</p> <p>Regarding the trade itself, the Raptors only gave up Jakob Poeltl, a center who was expected to be blocked by Jonas Valanciunas for the next two years, and a heavily protected first-round pick in a weak draft year. They firmly drew the line at not including OG Anunoby in the deal.</p> <p>Ujiri didn't risk his reputation as the \"Executive of the Year\" with this trade. He managed the risks accurately. When Tony Parker's performance after returning from injury didn't meet expectations, he decisively promoted Dejounte Murray. When the team struggled with outside shooting this season, he immediately brought back Marco Belinelli, a former teammate with great compatibility. For Aldridge, who is entering the twilight of his career, and Popovich, who could retire at any time, capturing the peak performance of these two key players is the most important task for the Spurs.</p> <p>This trade is no different! Compared to the likes of Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Dario Saric, Robert Covington, and other emerging talents, DeMar DeRozan is undoubtedly the most ready-to-contribute option.</p> <p>To be more objective, even if the Lakers or 76ers were willing to offer, it wouldn't be an easy task for them to reach the level of DeRozan within two years.</p> <p>In a way, the Raptors' willingness to put DeMar DeRozan on the trade table is truly fortunate for the Spurs.</p> <p>The most obvious comparison is the 2011 Carmelo Anthony trade, where the Nuggets sent Anthony to the Knicks mid-season and received Wilson Chandler, Raymond Felton, Danilo Gallinari, and Timofey Mozgov, along with an unprotected first-round pick. The trade resulted in a significant drop in the Nuggets' performance the following year, with fans mocking them as the \"Girls' Generation.\" It wasn't until they acquired Andre Iguodala through a trade that the team bounced back from their low point. The talent of Chandler and Gallinari back then was no less than that of Ingram and Kuzma today. However, basketball is not just about assembling a group of players; it is a league where \"a thousand soldiers are easily obtained, but a general is hard to find.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230928091338926567/","title":"Video NBA a year ago, who was interviewed who can help you win the championship Lillard alphabet elder brother","text":"<p>Video NBA a year ago, who was interviewed who can help you win the championship Lillard alphabet elder brother.</p> <p>Nowadays, with the development of the internet world, anything said will be recorded.

This is truly incredible! This team is amazing!\" Please continue reading. After winning the World Cup, former NBA player and German basketball legend Dirk Nowitzki congratulated his homeland on achieving this remarkable feat on his social media. This was a height that he had not reached in his 18-year national team career. The biggest contributor to this success was none other than Germany's captain and NBA player Dennis Schr\u00f6der.</p> <p>\"He won the bronze medal at the EuroBasket, the gold medal at the World Cup, and was named the World Cup MVP.\" \"Everything he has done deserves 100% respect.\" \"The respect that Dirk received in the past is now fully deserved by Schr\u00f6der.\" Please continue reading. Over the course of eight games, Schr\u00f6der averaged 19.1 points, 6.1 assists, and 1.4 steals per game. He not only led Germany to an undefeated gold medal with eight wins, but also scored 30 points and 8 assists against Australia, becoming the second German to score 30 points in an international game after Nowitzki.</p> <p>No wonder Germany's head coach Gordon Herbert praised Schr\u00f6der's performance and deserved respect after the game, and Schr\u00f6der, with such a performance, won the MVP award. \"It was a long wait.\" \"We won the bronze medal at the EuroBasket last year, and this year we won the gold medal at the World Cup. I waited for a whole decade.\" \"The coach did a great job in uniting the team.\" \"We achieved the feat of winning all eight games, including strong teams like Georgia and Slovenia.\" After winning the World Cup MVP, Schr\u00f6der also emotionally expressed how difficult the journey had been.</p> <p>Indeed, from 2015 EuroBasket, when Nowitzki passed the torch, to standing at the top of the world basketball in 2023, it was not an easy journey at all. Please continue reading. The Golden Era initiated by Nowitzki In 1997, Nowitzki began representing Germany in international competitions. In an exhibition game, Nowitzki dunked over NBA superstar Charles Barkley, leading Barkley to predict that this young man had the chance to become a superstar in the future.</p> <p>The following year, Nowitzki was selected into the NBA and with accumulated experience, his performance improved year by year. He brought back the skills he learned to the national team, instantly boosting Germany's strength with Nowitzki. Not only did they win the bronze medal at the 2002 FIBA World Championship (later renamed World Cup), but Nowitzki himself also won the MVP and scoring champion titles with an average of 24 points per game.</p> <p>Later in 2005, Nowitzki led Germany to a silver medal at the EuroBasket. Simply put, Nowitzki at that time was like a German-made tank, with stable quality and powerful firepower. With him, Germany had a solid foundation in terms of basketball strength.</p> <p>However, as the basketball strength of other countries gradually improved and Nowitzki stopped playing for the national team after the 2008 Olympics, Germany found it increasingly difficult to gain advantages on the world basketball stage. They lost in the 2009 EuroBasket and even had to rely on wildcards to qualify for the World Cup. Even though Nowitzki announced his return to the national team in 2011, it was challenging to return to the past glory of German basketball. After entering the second round, they only won against Turkey and ended their campaign. After the 2011 EuroBasket, Nowitzki retired from the national team once again, and without him, Germany even failed to qualify for the 2012 Olympics. In the 2013 EuroBasket, they were eliminated with a disappointing record of 1 win and 4 losses.</p> <p>In the 2015 EuroBasket, Nowitzki once again, and for the last time, put on the national team jersey with the goal of achieving good results for Germany, one of the host countries. However, things did not go as planned. The aging Nowitzki was already struggling on the court. They could only win 1 game and were eliminated in the preliminary round with a record of 1 win and 4 losses. Nowitzki announced his retirement from the national team in such a difficult situation. Elimination in the preliminary round and the retirement of the national pillar was a devastating blow to Germany. However, many German fans did not despair because they saw a 21-year-old future hope in this tournament. He became the leading scorer and assist leader for Germany with an average of 21 points and 6 assists per game. He ranked second in scoring and fourth in assists in the tournament. That person is Dennis Schr\u00f6der. Carrying on the torch of legacy. \"If I tell you that Nowitzki is my idol, I must be lying.\" \"I grew up watching games of Mike Conley, Chris Paul, and Tony Parker.\" \"But when I participated in the NBA draft and had a trial in Dallas, Nowitzki gave me his phone number.\" \"Since then, our relationship has been good.\"</p>"},{"location":"20230928091458754098/","title":"The feeling of going to war for your country is different - the chemistry between Tyrese Haliburton and the USA team","text":"<p>Before the start of the World Cup this year, Tyrese Haliburton talked to the media outlet Basketball Sphere about his expectations and the various challenges he faces in the World Cup and with the USA team   The feeling of going to war for your country is different - the chemistry between Tyrese Haliburton and the USA team</p> <p>Before the start of the World Cup this year, Tyrese Haliburton talked to the media outlet Basketball Sphere about his expectations and the various challenges he faces in the World Cup and with the USA team.</p> <p>Four years ago, the USA team finished with their worst-ever seventh-place finish in the World Cup.

Roundtable Sports Conference</p> <p>Although the law cannot make everyone equal, everyone is equal before the law; although the law restrains us, it also protects us accordingly.</p> <p>In August 2023, a player dispute involving cross-league and repeated contract signings took place in the Taiwan professional basketball league. The main character in this dispute was Lin Bing-Sheng, a professional basketball player.</p> <p>Lin Bing-Sheng was originally a member of the T1 championship team, the CTBC Bank Taipower. On August 15th, Lin Bing-Sheng signed a contract with the PLG Hsinchu Attack Lions as a free agent. However, the next day, Lin Bing-Sheng posted on his personal Instagram, expressing that due to career planning considerations, he declined to join the Attack Lions before the team made an official announcement. The Attack Lions immediately publicly revealed parts of the contract, stating that the player had clearly expressed his intention and signed a \"delegation contract,\" but then unilaterally terminated it. The Attack Lions urged Lin Bing-Sheng to fulfill his contractual obligations and accused the T1 Taipower of maliciously poaching.</p> <p>However, the T1 Taipower refuted that all procedures were \"in compliance with regulations.\" Therefore, after a coordination meeting in September, in which Lin Bing-Sheng did not participate, and no consensus was reached between the Basketball Association and the teams after two hours of coordination, the Attack Lions officially filed a lawsuit against Lin Bing-Sheng and the Taipower.</p> <p>Please continue reading. The Taiwan professional basketball market has been booming in recent years, with many second and third-generation entrepreneurs eager to invest in team operations. While enthusiasm is high, both the league and the teams need to establish a genuine professional basketball culture and an orderly system to ensure long-term development. Both teams also expressed during the meeting that more comprehensive fair competition regulations and related systems should be established to meet the needs of all parties and adapt to the rapidly changing professional basketball environment. However, we are curious, can a player who has signed a contract post on social media without reporting to the team? How can malicious poaching be prevented between different leagues using legal means? Can other teams sign players before the original team announces non-renewal? Can a player who has signed a \"delegation contract\" not fulfill their obligations? Yang Gui-Zhi, co-founder of Plain Language Law, stated in the Roundtable Sports Conference: Whether Lin Bing-Sheng needs to comply with contract provisions depends on the type of contract he signed. Although the Attack Lions publicly claimed to have signed a \"delegation contract\" with Lin Bing-Sheng, the nature of the contract is not determined by the title but by its content.</p> <p>As the professional basketball contract is non-standardized and considered a business secret, all terms cannot be disclosed. Therefore, let's first discuss whether it is a delegation contract. According to Article 549 of the Civil Code, in a delegation contract, either party can terminate the contract at any time. Even if there is a stipulated period or special provision that termination is not allowed, it is still generally believed that either party can terminate at any time because delegation is a task entrusted to you but does not require you to complete it. Therefore, from a legal perspective, Lin Bing-Sheng can terminate the contract at any time and play for another team. However, if this termination causes any harm to the Attack Lions (such as image, marketing, promotion, contract costs, etc.), compensation for damages would still be required. Please continue reading. If it is not a delegation contract but a \"contract for services,\" a contract for services is more binding. Its definition is an agreement for someone to help you complete a certain task and ensure that the task is completed according to the agreed standards.</p> <p>However, the possibility of signing a contract for services on the sports field is very low because the sports field is constantly changing, and we cannot guarantee the outcome of a particular event. For example, a player may get injured, or the tactical utilization by the coach each season may prevent every player from being able to play. This is also the case in life. If you hire a lawyer to handle a lawsuit, the lawsuit itself is very complex, and the lawyer cannot guarantee a win because there are risks and unknown factors in litigation. When you see a doctor or undergo surgery, although the doctor takes on your request, they cannot guarantee that you will recover because everyone's physical condition is different. Therefore, it is difficult to use a contract for services for litigation or medical treatment. On the other hand, a contract for services can be used when buying a house because the house needs to be built on time and meet certain standards. It cannot be a house made of sand or with radiation, etc. If the house is not built properly or leaks, penalties can be imposed. This type of contract is determined based on the outcome. But if a delegation contract can be terminated at any time and a contract for services cannot guarantee the outcome, what other type of contract can be used? There is a type of contract called an \"employment contract,\" which is similar to the employment relationship of ordinary office workers. This means that to some extent, the player's decision-making power is restricted by the team. For example, is the player's salary paid on time and fixed? Are there clear restrictions on the location and time of work? Will the player receive payment regardless of performance? Is collaboration with others necessary to complete the work?</p>"},{"location":"20230929091219767463/","title":"NBA player Rudy Gay has agreed to a one-year contract with the Warriors","text":"<p>NBA player Rudy Gay has agreed to a one-year contract with the Warriors.

Although they faced injury issues in Season 2, all their injured players have returned for this season, and the integration between local and foreign players is very smooth. This season will be the journey for the Sea Gods to reclaim their glory.</p> <p>Let's analyze the personnel in each position of the Kaohsiung Sea Gods, their strengths and weaknesses, the problems that need to be solved, and the key players.</p> <p>Time is precious, so let's get started! (I will focus on describing weaknesses and problems, as it is a professional analysis for a championship-contending team.)</p> <p>Player Analysis: Point Guard, Shooting Guard: Jason Brickman (The Brickman), Chen Huai'an, Yu Huan-ya, Su Wen-ju. (Plus Tang Wei-jie whose situation is unknown)</p> <p>Small Forward: Yu Chun-an, Wu Hsiao-chin, Qiu Zi-xuan, Lin Ren-hong.</p> <p>Power Forward: Hu Long-mao, Chin Ming-ching, Wang Yong-cheng, Lu Wei-ting, Wu Yi-pin.</p> <p>Center: Justin Hurtt, OJ Mayo, Dominique Jones.</p> <p>In the point guard and shooting guard positions, Jason Brickman remains the starting point guard, with Chen Huai'an as the backup. Yu Huan-ya and Su Wen-ju will take turns at the shooting guard position. These two players have different styles. Yu Huan-ya is an offensive player and the Sea Gods' main shooter, while Su Wen-ju is responsible for defense, changing the pace of the game, and guarding the opponent's foreign or local scoring players.</p> <p>Each of the four players in the power forward position has their own strengths and weaknesses. Lin Ren-hong's versatility and experience on the court make him a strong candidate for a starting position, but there is a concern about his previous foot injury and whether it has fully healed. Qiu Zi-xuan has explosive scoring ability and strong cutting and disrupting skills, but his inconsistency is one of his weaknesses. Yu Chun-an and Wu Hsiao-chin are more functional players who may focus on defense or three-point shooting off the bench, but they are equally important role players.</p> <p>The starting choice for the local power forward position is still highly likely to be Hu Long-mao, while Lu Wei-ting and Wu Yi-pin will most likely start as substitutes, playing the role of blue-collar players and competing for playing time. </p> <p>Advantages: The Sea Gods are a team with very balanced personnel allocation, and no position is lacking. In terms of scoring, they have the playmaking ability of Jason Brickman, the three-point shooting of Yu Huan-ya, and strong scoring abilities from Qiu Zi-xuan, Lin Ren-hong, Yu Chun-an, and Wu Hsiao-chin. In the local power forward position, they have Hu Long-mao, as well as Lu Wei-ting who performed excellently in the recent World University Games. As for the center position, Justin Hurtt, OJ Mayo, and Dominique Jones are all talented players. Defensively, the Sea Gods are also strong. They have quick rotations and excellent individual defensive abilities, such as Su Wen-ju, who was heavily relied upon last season, and Lin Ren-hong, who started as a defensive player. In addition, their foreign centers have excellent rim protection abilities, providing defensive pressure to opponents' attacks. Overall, the Sea Gods are a well-rounded team with stable strength, no major weaknesses, and every game is played steadily, relying on excellent teamwork to gradually pull away and win games.</p> <p>Weaknesses: The Sea Gods' strengths are also their weaknesses, as their offense is too predictable. They lack a foreign player who can score consistently, so when facing opponents with explosive foreign players, they lack someone who can match them. We can observe from the games they lost last season that the Sea Gods' scoring remained stable at their usual level, but in each of those games, there was always someone from the opposing team who suddenly stepped up and took over the game.</p> <p>The second weakness is the lack of a second ball handler, despite having a strong starting point guard in Jason Brickman. In the previous season, especially in the playoffs, we could see that Brickman almost played the entire game. This led to a sharp decline in his physical condition, and in the final quarter of the fifth game, his signature jump shot missed twice. Therefore, whether the Sea Gods can find a backup point guard to replace Brickman is also a challenge for them this season.</p> <p>The third concern is injuries, which was a problem the Sea Gods faced last season. Will Justin Hurtt's foot injury fully heal? Will OJ Mayo's finger injury from last season affect him this season? Will Lin Ren-hong's ankle sprain recover completely? Not to mention Hu Long-mao, who just had surgery for his back injury during the offseason. How much he can recover is still unknown. Personally, I believe this issue will be one of the factors determining how far the Sea Gods can go this season.</p> <p>Problem to Solve: The Sea Gods' problem has been discussed since last season and is quite apparent - the lack of height at the power forward position. The reason behind this is their key player, point guard Jason Brickman. Since the second season, he cannot be considered a local player and must be listed as a foreign player due to league rules. As only two foreign players can be on the court at the same time, the Sea Gods lack a tall power forward or center in their lineup. In the previous season, we often saw teams bring in two tall foreign players specifically to deal with Hu Long-mao at the power forward position when facing the Sea Gods.</p>"},{"location":"20230929091324722560/","title":"Jrue Holiday, who had just expressed his desire to stay with the Bucks forever, was traded today","text":"<p>Yesterday, Bucks guard Jrue Holiday gave an interview where he was asked about his willingness to re-sign with the team, considering that he only has one year left on his contract    Jrue Holiday, who had just expressed his desire to stay with the Bucks forever, was traded today</p> <p>Yesterday, Bucks guard Jrue Holiday gave an interview where he was asked about his willingness to re-sign with the team, considering that he only has one year left on his contract.</p> <p>\"I think I've said before that I will always be a part of the Bucks.

And judging by Curry's current form and style of play, if he wants to, he has a great chance of playing well into his forties. If Curry does play for such a long time, there is a very good chance that he will surpass 4000 career three-pointers.</p> <p>Please continue reading. 4000 is an astonishing number, almost impossible to achieve and break in the NBA. Even if there is a chance, it would likely take a very long time.</p> <p>However, interestingly, there is a player among active players quietly chasing this Hall of Fame level super shooter, and his name is not one that resonates loudly in the NBA, nor is he a player that the average fan would think of as a superstar.</p> <p>That's right, it's not James Harden, although currently ranked third, Harden's career three-point shooting percentage of 36.3% and his age of 34 make it difficult for him to catch up. And it's not Luka Doncic either. While he may have a chance to surpass 3000 career three-pointers, his current shooting accuracy of 33.8% needs to reach another level to compete at the level of 4000. </p> <p>Some might guess Damian Lillard and Paul George, who possess top-notch accuracy. They are currently ranked 10th and 26th, respectively, and have a chance to reach the top five in history. However, like Harden, they are both 33 years old and in the later stages of their careers, making it difficult for them to catch up to Curry.</p> <p>Many might guess that it's Curry's current teammate Klay Thompson, who is currently ranked 18th on the three-point leaderboard. Initially, \"Splash Brother\" Klay had a chance, but two major injuries significantly slowed down his progress. Without those two major injuries, he might have already surpassed 2300 three-pointers and ranked 6th while still in his prime. However, Thompson is also 34 years old, making it equally difficult for him to keep up with Curry's pace. Please continue reading. So who is the most likely candidate? You read it right, it's Buddy Hield. Photo source: Getty Images. Currently playing for the Indiana Pacers, Hield has a career three-point shooting percentage of 40.2%. In the past five seasons, Hield has ranked either second or fourth in total three-pointers made for four seasons.</p> <p>Since the 2017-18 season, no player, including Curry, has made more three-pointers than Hield's 1557.</p> <p>In the past five seasons, Hield has averaged 276 three-pointers per season. If he can maintain that level in the 2023-24 season, he will rise from 29th to 17th on the all-time list. If he can maintain it for another season, he will surpass Dirk Nowitzki and become 16th. If he can make a few more and reach 284, he will surpass Jason Kidd and become 15th. In the 2022-23 season, Hield made 288 three-pointers in a single season, second only to Thompson's 301.</p> <p>Hield is currently 30 years old and has played at least 70 games in each of the past six seasons. He has played 80 games in four seasons and has only missed three games in the past two seasons. Please continue reading. Let's assume that both Hield and Curry can play until the age of 40. That means Curry has about five more seasons, while Hield has ten more seasons.</p> <p>Hield's average of three-pointers per season has already surpassed Curry's (around 243). If Hield can maintain an average of 276 three-pointers per season until the age of 40, his career total will approach 4500. If Curry can maintain a level of 300 three-pointers per season for the next five years, he will accumulate approximately 4890 career three-pointers, which is still far beyond Hield. However, this is an overly optimistic assumption, as Curry's injuries and declining skills will have an impact. As long as Hield can have a breakout season two or three times in the coming years, he may have a chance to get closer, or even challenge Curry's record.</p> <p>However, in reality, it is still very challenging for Hield to surpass Curry's record, mainly due to the significant gap in shooting consistency between Hield and Curry.</p> <p>In Hield's nine-year career, he has only had four seasons with a three-point shooting percentage above 40%. On the other hand, excluding the injury-plagued 2019-20 season, Curry has only had one season with a three-point shooting percentage below 40%. But based on the current accumulation and form, Hield is the most likely candidate to challenge Curry, and he still has several good years ahead of him. Most importantly, Hield is very healthy and his playing style is less prone to injury. Even as he ages, in this era of three-point shooting, as long as he is willing, he will definitely have playing opportunities. According to Synergy's data, in the 2022-23 season, Hield had a 45.8% catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage, a 42% pull-up jump shot three-point shooting percentage, a 41.5% catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage, and a 61.5% step-back three-point shooting percentage. Overall, his three-point shooting percentage reached an impressive 42.5%, with the left and right corner three-point shooting percentages reaching 51.1% and 45.7%, respectively.</p>"},{"location":"20230929091641972249/","title":"NBA player Tyson Chandler reminisced about the journey to the 2011 championship, stating that he didn't expect to sweep the Lakers and that the Thunder was the toughest opponent","text":"<p>NBA player Tyson Chandler reminisced about the journey to the 2011 championship, stating that he didn't expect to sweep the Lakers and that the Thunder was the toughest opponent.

He has not only shown excellent skills in both offense and defense, but also displayed a dominating presence on the court, once again living up to his nickname as the War God. Benefiting from the injuries within the team last year, Qiu Zixuan gained many opportunities to play and his explosive offensive energy often made it difficult for opponents to resist. With his agility and assertive moves, his future prospects are very promising.</p> <p>Please continue reading \u25bc Although Qiu Zixuan was unable to win a championship, it is undoubtedly his biggest regret. Whether in Dongshan High School, National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism, or in his professional career, he has always been unable to personally touch the championship trophy. He earned the title of \"Dongshan War God\" in the High School Basketball League (HBL), leading his team to the top four in the league and achieving the best record in team history. After studying at a university in the United States, he returned to Taiwan in 2020 and joined National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism. He performed well and decided to challenge himself in the professional league. In the first round of the T1 League draft, he was selected by the Kaohsiung Family Mart Sea Gods, allowing him to stay in the familiar environment of southern Taiwan and reunite with his college coach, Xie Yujuan.</p> <p>The Sea Gods' head coach, Brendan Joyce, has never been afraid to use rookies, so Qiu Zixuan quickly became a key player off the bench. His versatile offensive skills and speed make him the pivot for changing the team's pace. In the game against the Clouded Leopards on December 4th, he scored an impressive 31 points, 3 rebounds, 4 assists, and 2 steals in just 27 minutes. His sharp and accurate attacks, as well as his fearlessness in facing foreign players, make it hard to believe that he is a rookie in his first year of professional play. In the second half of the season, the team's front line suffered from injuries, giving him the opportunity to showcase his talents. Despite needing improvement in his shooting percentage, he solidly contributed to the team's score and played a crucial role in changing the momentum during the playoffs. Throughout the season, he averaged nearly 20 minutes on the court, contributing 7.7 points, 3 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game, making him the only rival to Gu Mao Wei Jia in the Rookie of the Year race.</p> <p>Of course, for the Sea Gods, who came to defend their title, they faced many challenges and were eliminated in the first round by the Hawks. However, nurturing the future star Qiu Zixuan has made the team's front line even stronger. Lin Renhong and Wu Xiaojin will no longer be isolated.</p> <p>Qiu Zixuan, Su Wenru, and L\u00fc Weiting were all selected for this year's World University Games team, and all three of them have performed well. They can both attack and defend in the front line. Although they are not tall enough to resist opponents, they have become the backbone of the Chinese team and have grown through exchanges with world-class players. Please continue reading \u25bc</p> <p>From the perspective of the author, Qiu Zixuan can be considered the most consistent player, apart from You Aizhe, Gao Jinwei, and Lin Zhijie. He was set as a starter from the beginning. Except for the games against Lithuania and Japan, he scored in double digits in all other games. In the match against China, he frequently broke through the defense and grabbed 9 rebounds, punishing opponents who tried to guard him one-on-one.</p> <p>In the ranking matches against South Africa and Poland, his performance on the outside was particularly outstanding, hitting three three-pointers in each game. The combination of inside and outside play made it difficult for opponents to defend against him. In addition, his defense is also impressive. Although lacking in technique, he compensates with his determination. He performs well in the wide area, the second and third zones, and individual defense. He made 11 steals in six games, triggering several fast breaks, showcasing the fast-paced playing style of his coach Liu Mengzhu.</p> <p>Qiu Zixuan averaged 10.6 points, 3 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 1.8 steals per game. His playing time increased with each game, highlighting his importance to the team. Although he is only 190 cm tall and struggles against European and American powerhouses, he is the first player in the Chinese team who can break through the limitations. Alongside You Aizhe and Gao Jinwei, he constantly disrupts the opponent's defense, bringing important speed and impact, just like in his professional league experience.</p> <p>Seeing his performance reminds me of Lin Zhijie in the early stages of his career. They are similar in height, but exude a commanding presence and are fearless in both offense and defense. This is the courage that young players should have, and it truly reflects his title as the \"War God\". His offense is even more impressive than his defense. He has a stable shooting mechanism and accurate outside shooting. He does not take shots casually or hastily. He understands tactics and positioning, inheriting the characteristics of players produced by National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism. His cutting speed and soft shooting touch, although mainly attacking the basket, are sufficient and flexible. Of course, young players still need to put in effort. Once they are double-teamed or pushed to the sideline, mistakes are more likely to occur. Ball handling also needs improvement. However, his awareness of offense and defense and execution of tasks are on point, making him a reliable player.</p> <p>\u25bc \"Holding the ball\" becomes a future task, allowing the War God to shine In fact, Qiu Zixuan is a player with a good shooting touch. It wouldn't be a bad option for him to transform into a shooting guard or focus on shooting. However, he did not choose this path and instead became a versatile front line player. Although his moves and finesse need improvement, I believe this is the key to him finding a unique position in the future.</p> <p>Moreover, professional teams lack front line players who can handle the ball and attack. Most of the time, they rely on guards or inside players to score. If he can develop a variety of offensive skills, he could become one of the players who can provide firepower from the front line.</p>"},{"location":"20230929091753417552/","title":"Who is Mizuno Wave Rider 27 or 26?","text":"<p>When someone asks, \"I want to start running, does Mizuno have recommended shoes?\" I just started running and my goal is to finish a full marathon, which Mizuno shoes are more suitable?

I have started following a training plan seriously, are there any recommended Mizuno running shoes for daily training? The answer to all these questions is most likely Mizuno Wave Rider. As Mizuno's most classic and evergreen running shoe, the Wave Rider series has always maintained a stable focus on functionality, creating shoes that are suitable for entry-level runners or daily training. It performs well in cushioning, stability, durability, and comfort. Although it may not have the flagship specifications in terms of weight, flexibility, and other aspects, it is definitely a series of shoes that you don't have to worry about stepping on a landmine.</p> <p>You don't have to worry about the kind of shoes that you are used to wearing. What if they are discontinued? The Wave Rider series is the kind of series that you can continue wearing.</p> <p>If your Wave Rider 25 is worn out and you can't find it anymore, you can seamlessly transition to the 26th or 27th version. They are both good choices that you can adapt to without any discomfort. This has also become one of the biggest features of the Wave Rider series. Although there may not be significant updates between generations, they all have a relatively stable functional output. This directly leads to today's conclusion: comparing the differences between the two siblings, Rider 26 VS 27. The two shoes have about 90% similarity in terms of functionality.

Mizuno Wave Rider 26 difference: heel drop: 12mm (24mm in the front, 36mm in the back). Please continue reading for a high-visibility comparison of Wave Rider 26 &amp; 27. The two models have almost identical configurations, with the biggest difference being the last. Rider 27 has two lasts, a regular last and a 2E extra wide last. However, compared to the previous generation, the wide last of the 27th version is approximately between a regular D last and a 2E last, while the 2E extra wide last is similar to a regular 2E last.</p> <p>The last design of the 26th version can be said to be a significant increase compared to the 27th version. The 2E extra wide last of the 26th version is approximately equivalent to a regular 4E last, so you need to pay attention to the size selection of these two shoes.</p> <p>PS: Rider 27 has released a limited edition color for breast cancer, available for both men and women, very attractive! Please continue reading for the difference in upper: Both shoes have a similar design in terms of the upper. Rider 27 uses floral breathable mesh upper with TPU accents, while the 26th version also uses TPU strips. They have similar performances in terms of breathability, support, and stability, including reinforced durability in places like the lace holes.</p> <p>The dual-layer breathable mesh upper is not too thick, so you don't have to worry too much about breathability. Even with temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius, there is no overly stuffy feeling after running. Although it may not have the same breathability as racing shoes, where you can feel the breeze when riding a motorcycle, taking off the Rider shoes after a run, your socks won't feel damp and hot. They are also suitable for daily wear. If the breathability of racing shoes is rated 95 out of 100, Rider 26 &amp; 27 should score around 75. They also have similar performances in terms of stability and support. The tongue design of Rider 26 &amp; 27 is also quite similar, with a breathable tongue of moderate thickness. The thickness of the tongue can reduce the pressure from the laces. The 27th version has larger mesh holes and both tongues use a half-sock design to prevent them from moving around. Another difference is the length of the laces! The laces of Rider 26 are really too long, even with the bunny ear lacing method, they are still quite long. The regular lacing method may even reach the ground. In Rider 27, the length of the laces has been adjusted. In terms of heel design, the height of the collar and the thickness of the padding are not significantly different. When pressing the built-in cup-shaped stability plate, there seems to be a slight difference. In Rider 27, the curvature of the heel is smoother. However, in terms of stability, support, and fit, there is not much difference. It is still stable and does not require much attention.</p> <p>Midsole difference: Both Rider 27 and 26 use a dual-layer Enerzy cushioning material with a Wave Plate stability plate embedded in the middle. I remember when I jumped from the 24th version to the 26th version, the difference in foot feel was quite obvious. It felt too soft and comfortable at the time. The dual-layer Enerzy cushioning midsole is soft and provides a slightly elastic foot feel. Although the cushioning may not be top-notch for extreme running, as a daily training shoe for someone with a weight of 82kg like me, it is more than enough. It is suitable for easy runs, long slow distance (LSD) runs, and other steady-paced runs.</p> <p>The Wave Rider series is designed for runners who finish a full marathon in approximately 4.5 hours. Therefore, running at a pace of around 5 minutes 30 seconds to 6 minutes per kilometer is highly recommended. It has a perfect balance of not being too heavy or too light, providing a comfortable running experience. Its speed increase performance is also not bad. Overall, it is a well-balanced shoe without any particularly outstanding features. For example, if you are looking for a propulsion system like carbon-plated shoes or an extremely soft cushioning feel, you won't find them in the Rider series. It may even be a bit challenging to use them for intervals at a pace of 4 minutes 30 seconds per kilometer. However, for daily training, they are definitely more than enough.</p> <p>The built-in Wave Plate stability plate provides good support and stability in the soft midsole. It does not put too much burden on the ankles, making it suitable for recovery runs. Although the Rider series is not a stability shoe, its support is already among the top-class for regular shoes. It feels like more than friends but not yet lovers. Therefore, it is very friendly for runners who are just starting out and still training their muscles.</p> <p>When you put on both shoes and step on them, there is actually not much difference in terms of the feeling of stepping on the midsole. Only when you wear one shoe on each foot, you can feel that the 27th version seems to be slightly softer by about 10%. But the difference is not significant (the height of the midsole of the two shoes differs by 2mm). PS: Wave Rider 26 &amp; 27 also have foam insoles similar to Ortholite, which provide a good foot feel.</p>"},{"location":"20230929091910406583/","title":"112UBA New Challenges After Creating History - Chen Yuanwen of Nan Ying University","text":"<p>During his high school and university years, Chen Yuanwen can be considered a \"creator of school team history    112UBA New Challenges After Creating History - Chen Yuanwen of Nan Ying University</p> <p>During his high school and university years, Chen Yuanwen can be considered a \"creator of school team history.\" While studying at Shanhua High School, he helped the team win their first high school level B championship in his second year. Then, after transferring to Nan Ying University, he helped this team, which consisted entirely of players from high school level B teams, rise to prominence. In the 111th academic year, they made it to the top four of the A2 level, earning the qualification to move up to the A1 level.</p> <p>Continuing to read further, Chen Yuanwen competed on the court of the Chang Yao Cup during his high school years. He even made it to the star training team of that cup. Five and a half years later, Chen Yuanwen and Nan Ying University were invited to participate in this year's Chang Yao Cup, which moved from Banqiao to Xinzhuang. However, what remains unchanged is that Chen Yuanwen, who had just helped the team win the league championship, once again experienced the intensity of playing at the college level as a \"creator of history.\" (Read more: Introduction to Star Players of the 2018 Chang Yao Cup - Center Edition (Part 1)) Throughout the game, it was evident that Nan Ying University was still trying to find a higher intensity of play, but there were still bright spots. Chen Yuanwen scored the second-highest points for the team and grabbed six rebounds. Despite not being tall or explosively athletic, Chen Yuanwen has relied on his unique intuition around the basket since high school. In the game against Chengchi University, he still played to his strengths and found opportunities to score by exploiting gaps in the defense of foreign players. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Speaking about his feelings of returning to the Chang Yao Cup five years later, Chen Yuanwen smiled and said, \"After all, it's a different level. Now we are playing as a member of the public first level. The mentality is different, and I feel my own growth!\" But he immediately analyzed with seriousness, \"I think the biggest difference is physique, followed by experience. After all, we all came from the B group, while our opponents have played in international games and professional teams. We only started exchanging with A1 level teams this summer. But overall, I think the content of the game is good. We haven't reached our best level of cooperation yet, so we will continue to work hard and focus on every detail that we can improve.\"</p> <p>Continuing to read, Chen Yuanwen revealed that entering the A1 level was something that he never imagined before but has now become a reality. He admitted that most members of Nan Ying University do not prioritize basketball as the center of their lives, and they do not have many advantages in terms of talent. Last year, the team even had to train extra after the draw results for the second level national competition were announced, which can be described as a last-minute effort. However, after winning the first game in the national tournament and advancing to the top eight by defeating Kun Shan University, Nan Ying University had already achieved a milestone in team history. Throughout the process, Chen Yuanwen only focused on giving his all and did not think too much about the outcome. But as the final whistle sounded in the game against National Wake Up University, he couldn't help but be filled with excitement, leaving tears of a man behind.</p> <p>\"I originally thought it was already good enough to make it to the top sixteen, but then we made it to the top eight, and then the top four. I truly never imagined that we, who came from the B level, could personally accomplish this!\" Chen Yuanwen reminisced. He admitted that he felt \"closer to professionalism than ever before\" as he approached what he thought would be the end of his basketball career. If he could attract the attention of professional teams through his performance in the A1 level, continuing to run on the court would also be an option for the future. However, at the moment, he will focus on preparing for the UBA season of the new academic year and strive wholeheartedly towards \"creating history\" once again, aiming to secure the team's place in the league. \"This is already the stage I most desired. There are no regrets in my basketball career! I will give my all in every game and let our opponents know that we also have the strength to challenge here!\" Follow the sports scene for more in-depth coverage.

Among the international teams, Bundang Business High School from South Korea, also known as the \"Empress of Korean High School Women's Basketball,\" has been announced as one of the prominent teams. Not only has this school established a dynasty in the Korean high school basketball scene, but it has also played a significant role in the professional development of women's basketball in Korea and the nurturing of national team players.</p> <p>Despite its relatively short history, Bundang Business High School women's basketball team quickly rose to become one of the powerhouses in Korean women's basketball. Since its establishment in December 2007, the team has achieved remarkable success. They won third place in the 2010 National Federation Chairman's Basketball Championship and a silver medal in the 92nd National Sports Festival in 2011. In the following years, from 2014 to 2015, they swept all major competitions in the national high school women's division, winning numerous gold medals. Currently, they maintain an unbeaten record in the KSSBF Korean Middle and High School Basketball League for three consecutive years. This year, the team aims to achieve a three-peat in the national competitions.</p> <p>As a rising star in Korean high school women's basketball, Bundang Business High School has produced numerous national team players and professional basketball talents in the past decade. One of the most well-known players is Park Ji-soo, who earned the titles of \"Korea's Greatest Center of All Time\" and \"Basketball Prodigy.\" She became the youngest (16 years old) female national team player in Korean history and was selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the 5th overall pick in the 2018 WNBA Draft. Park Ji-soo is the second Korean player to enter the WNBA after Jung Sun-min, who played for the Seattle Storm in 2003. Additionally, key players such as Byun Soo-jung, Ko Na-yeon, and Park Soo-hee, who led the Korean team to the Round of 16 in the 2021 U19 World Cup, also hail from Bundang Business High School. Byun Soo-jung and Park Soo-hee were even selected as the second and third overall picks in the previous season's WKBL draft, earning them the nickname \"Monster Rookies.\" Park Ji-soo, who emerged from Bundang Business High School, is considered one of the most promising female basketball players in recent years.</p> <p>In the first half of this year, Bundang Business High School women's basketball team achieved a three-peat in national tournaments, winning the 60th Spring National High School Basketball Federation Championship, the 48th Association Chairman Ki Middle School Basketball Championship, and the 2023 King of Kings Weekend Basketball League. The active players who have secured their spots in this year's Changyao Cup include Seo You-jung, Park Do-won, and Byun Heo-jung, who was named the FMVP of the King of Kings tournament. These players are highly regarded in the development of Korean high school women's basketball and have recently announced their participation in the 2023-24 WKBL draft, becoming the latest focus of the national basketball scene.</p> <p>Despite being a highly influential high school team in Korea, Bundang Business High School faces the challenge of achieving better results on the international stage. This is an issue that cannot be ignored at various levels of Korean basketball. However, as one of the five international high schools invited to participate in the Changyao Cup, the coaching staff of Bundang Business High School sees this as an important opportunity. They hope to not only share and showcase their championship-winning skills and abilities with their international counterparts but also foster the development of the team through cultural exchanges. Additionally, they aim to provide their players with more international experience, which will contribute to their personal growth and future careers. The participation of Bundang Business High School women's basketball team in the 10th Changyao Cup (pictured above) is eagerly anticipated.</p> <p>For further information, please read the following articles: - \"Post-Legendary Advancement: Sakura Gakuin High School in Japan\"  - \"Preparing for Higher Goals: TSF Atlanta Preparatory Academy in the United States\" - \"Innovating International Competitiveness: Manila Athenaeum University High School in the Philippines\"</p>"},{"location":"20230930091203705058/","title":"World Cup: Doncic complains about Brooks constantly approaching the referees without blowing the whistle","text":"<p>Luka Doncic    World Cup: Doncic complains about Brooks constantly approaching the referees without blowing the whistle</p> <p>Luka Doncic.</p> <p>Yesterday's quarter-final match in the FIBA World Cup between Canada and Slovenia was marked by issues with the referees.

The wind is sharp, and little Iron intends to be like it. I hope to have more discussions and share various opinions on watching games. After the press conference, the 2023 Cross-League Invitational Tournament will once again take place, this time even bigger than last year. Even the three-time champion of the University Basketball Association, National Chengchi University, will step onto the battlefield and test if the \"Universe NCCU\" can challenge higher levels, which will undoubtedly become a major topic of the Cross-League Invitational Tournament. As the younger brother, NCCU has no burden. No one will blame them for losing to professional teams, but if they win, the big brother may not be able to save face. The tournament rules state that foreign players cannot be used, but foreign students can be registered, and foreign students are NCCU's basic equipment. The main player, who is known as the \"strongest foreign student,\" can participate, which is advantageous for NCCU. However, NCCU challenging higher levels may not be the biggest topic of this tournament. If we consider Taiwan Beer Leopards and SBL Taiwan Beer as a joint team, the T1 League newcomer, Taipei Fubon Braves, can be said to be the purest representative of the T1 League participating team. In the last Cross-League Invitational Tournament, the T1 League outperformed P. LEAGUE+ and SBL, and the championship game was a T1 League showdown between New Taipei Fubon Braves and Taiwan Beer Bears. However, before the Braves took the court, the Taipei Fubon Braves became the biggest topic, but not because of any positive news about the team. Please continue reading. On the participation list, Taipei Fubon Braves wrote \"Lin Ping-Cheng\" in black and white, as previously claimed. Lin Ping-Cheng will indeed represent the Braves in the Cross-League Invitational Tournament. Of course, this time, the tournament does not have Hsinchu Formosa Taishin Dreamers who participated last time, which somewhat reduces the storm. However, Lin Ping-Cheng, Formosa Taishin Dreamers, and the Braves are destined to be the focus of Taiwanese basketball this offseason. And just today, the Braves held a press conference to announce the team lineup, cheerleaders, mascot, and two foreign players, as well as the foreign head coach Brian Adams. However, whether it is the news on social media about the press conference or the comments on the live stream of the press conference, they are filled with criticism and mockery, making it clear that the Braves did not step onto the stage of the Taiwanese professional basketball league in a celebratory atmosphere. The never-ending storm of the \"Braves,\" please continue reading. The Taipei Fubon Braves and Lin Ping-Cheng held a press conference on Monday (September 11) to publicly announce the team's lineup, cheerleaders, mascot, and two foreign players, as well as their recent developments and decision-making processes. However, the biggest problem is that at the end of the \"press conference,\" the host on-site said that Lin Ping-Cheng and the appointed lawyer \"will not be interviewed\" and only allowed reporters to \"chat with team leader Shang Jui-Chiang\" if they had any questions. However, throughout the press conference, apart from emphasizing the opposition between Taipei Fubon and Formosa Dreamers, Shang Jui-Chiang only revealed some statements like \"the price of the Braves may not be higher than that of the Dreamers, but it provides Lin Ping-Cheng with more security overseas.\" In terms of a press conference, this is undoubtedly a very bad way to handle it. From an obvious perspective, this is an event where one person signs contracts with two teams. Of course, the contract of one party (Dreamers) is now questioned and may be invalid. But the key point lies in the person who signed with both parties. Unless he is sure that his proactive statement is flawless and leaves no doubt for all parties, the reporters will naturally want to ask this person questions. And of course, Taipei Fubon may be worried that Lin Ping-Cheng, as a player, may have doubts about his ability to express himself. However, this is the job of the appointed lawyer. Since Lin Ping-Cheng was able to be represented by an appointed lawyer in the previous coordination meeting, it is the basic obligation for both Lin Ping-Cheng and the appointed lawyer to be interviewed at the press conference they both attended today. However, in the end, Lin Ping-Cheng inexplicably said, \"I will take responsibility for what I should.\" The appointed lawyer only mentioned the \"right to bring legal action,\" which has become a basic joke on the internet. Then, the two refused to be interviewed and only left team leader Shang Jui-Chiang. From the content of his \"chat\" with the media, it is obvious that Coach Shang cannot clarify any doubts about Lin Ping-Cheng. In other words, although there have been many details revealed from the outbreak of the event until now, such as the time Formosa Dreamers contacted Lin Ping-Cheng, the content of the contract, and the contract period, none of them are perfect and can be attacked. But after this \"press conference\" ended on Monday, the negative opinions towards Taipei Fubon increased even more. This negative evaluation even extended to the social media platform. Taipei Fubon Braves' Instagram account went live after the press conference, and Lin Ping-Cheng, who was once indifferent to joining the Dreamers, actively commented on many posts by the Braves. Especially when the Braves introduced their players in subsequent posts, Lin Ping-Cheng almost always left comments very early, expressing his recognition as a team member and goodwill towards his teammates. However, due to recent inappropriate public appearances or statements, the Braves' Instagram account became like a \"burning\" platform. Not only did Lin Ping-Cheng's comments receive numerous critical replies, but even when Lin Ping-Cheng stopped commenting, mocking comments from netizens continued to flood the Braves' Instagram account.

Lithuania could have assembled a team with all the top players, but players like Domantas Sabonis, Marius Grigonis, Rokas Giedraitis, Edgaras Ulanovas, Arnas Butkevicius, Lukas Lekavicius, and Arturas Gudaitis refused to represent Lithuania in the World Cup for various reasons.</p> <p>However, the remaining players have become a perfect example that star players do not always guarantee the best results, and vice versa.</p> <p>Continue reading Although it was disappointing that Sabonis, a top Lithuanian basketball star, chose not to participate in the World Cup, it somewhat relieved head coach Kazys Maksvytis. He no longer has to worry about how to make Valanciunas and Sabonis work well together on the court, as previous coaches have struggled to successfully pair these two NBA players, as proven in previous international competitions.</p> <p>Valanciunas became the team's main low-post threat, guaranteeing scoring in the paint.

He is well aware that if he performs poorly, we may face a difficult game. He struggled in his debut, just like last year. But he quickly learned from his mistakes and made progress.\" said Mindaugas Kuzminskas.</p> <p>With Marius Grigonis withdrawing, Ignas Brazdeikis becomes the only true scoring threat who can solve problems in crucial moments, especially when Lithuania needs a last-minute one-on-one solution. Teammates have noticed that Brazdeikis is less inclined to force his way to the basket and instead reads the situation well and is willing to share the ball, unlike last year.</p> <p>Brazdeikis currently averages 11.5 points per game, with a two-point field goal percentage of 54.5% and an impressive three-point field goal percentage of 70%. He also contributes with 4.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game.</p> <p>His turnovers have decreased from 2.2 in the previous EuroBasket to 1.0 in the World Cup, and his shooting percentage has increased by a surprising 20.7%.</p> <p>The other players around this core team have showcased their professional specialties, whether as defensive aces or versatile veterans, always prioritizing team success over personal ambitions.</p> <p>For example, former New York Knicks player Mindaugas Kuzminskas hardly made it into the rotation in the 2019 World Cup and 2021 Olympic qualifiers.

However, Political University quickly regained the lead with a timeout called by You Aizhe, who scored 8 points in a row, along with a buzzer-beating shot, allowing Political University to maintain a 41-37 advantage at halftime.</p> <p>In the third quarter, Political University's Zhuang Zhaosheng and Wu Zhikai hit consecutive three-pointers, leading an 8-0 run to extend their lead to 49-37. Left-handed foreign player Popoka made two free throws, widening the gap to 51-37. Taiwan Bank's Chen Youxu ended the drought with a basket after 7 minutes and 10 seconds, but Political University continued their fast-break attacks, pushing their lead to 61-43. Lin Zihao's three-pointer further increased the margin to 21 points. Political University dominated the third quarter with a 25-8 run, entering the fourth quarter with a comfortable 66-45 lead. Although Taiwan Bank's Jian Jiawei and Lin Zheting's consecutive three-pointers momentarily narrowed the gap to 8 points and Political University's foreign player Popoka fouled out early, Political University's Wu Zhikai and foreign player Mustafa responded with scoring runs, restoring their double-digit advantage. In the end, Political University secured their first victory with a final score of 87-76. Four players from Political University scored in double figures, with Song Xinhao leading the team with 22 points, followed by You Aizhe with 20 points, 9 assists, and 8 rebounds, Lin Zihao with 13 points, and Popoka with 11 points and 15 rebounds.

Josh Hart became a starter: the United States actively changed their lineup to continue their winning streak. In the game against Lithuania, they aimed to secure first place in Group J. However, in the first quarter, they dug an even deeper hole for themselves. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Although Lithuania has a small population, they have always been a basketball powerhouse, with records of facing the United States in the Olympics and World Cups.</p> <p>However, Lithuania missed the Olympics in their own country in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Due to groupings, they did not face the United States in the 2019 World Cup or the 2016 Rio Olympics. The last time these two teams met in a top international competition was in the 2014 World Cup. Lithuania's only victory against the United States was in the 2004 Athens Olympics, where legendary guard Sarunas Jasikevicius scored 28 points to lead the team to defeat the United States in the preliminary round.</p> <p>In fact, Lithuania came close to making history in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. After a fierce battle in the semifinals, Jasikevicius missed a three-pointer in the final moments, resulting in a 2-point loss. They could not become the first team to defeat the entire NBA United States team. It wasn't until two years later at the World Championships that Argentine legend Manu Ginobili achieved this feat.</p> <p>Both teams had maintained undefeated records before this match and had already secured their spots in the upcoming knockout stage. This game was more like a battle of momentum and dignity.</p> <p>In this game, the absence of power forward Domantas Sabonis, due to injury, allowed Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas, the Pelicans' center, to play well. Valan\u010di\u016bnas is a heavyweight center, while Sabonis, although slightly smaller in size, has similar mobility. When they play together, they may dominate the rebounds against their opponents, but they suffer defensively. Offensively, Sabonis and Valan\u010di\u016bnas' outside shooting ability is not enough to create sufficient spacing. Even though Sabonis has excellent playmaking and passing skills from the high post, the lack of spacing makes it difficult to utilize their skills effectively on the FIBA court. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Without Sabonis playing in this game, the scene of two monks without water has disappeared, and they can return to the traditional style of setting screens and making cuts without the ball.</p> <p>With Rokas Jokubaitis, the team's main point guard, and other smart players, as well as the explosive forward Ignas Brazdeikis, who can pass and cut repeatedly, Lithuania knows exactly what they are doing. They have a disciplined and well-coordinated team.</p> <p>Lithuania had a clear and concise strategy for this game. They targeted the lack of competitiveness in the American backcourt and used a switching defense strategy to create mismatches. They took advantage of their superior competitiveness to frequently score in the low post. Starting point guard Jalen Brunson committed three fouls, and Austin Reaves, who had performed well in previous games, fouled out. The American guards were truly in trouble.</p> <p>Luck can be said to be the best description of this game. Lithuania started the game by hitting nine consecutive three-pointers, completely pulling ahead. Less than a minute into the game, the United States briefly took a 4-2 lead, but then Lithuania launched a barrage of three-pointers and dominated the offensive rebounds throughout the game, with the United States constantly playing catch-up.</p> <p>In the first quarter, starting center Jaren Jackson Jr. (JJJ) committed two fouls, and in the second quarter, he committed another foul, totaling three fouls in the first half. He fouled out again, leaving the United States without their most powerful presence in the paint. Facing Lithuania's three-point barrage, the United States needed a center who could defend the perimeter, but JJJ, who was best suited for this role, could only sit on the sidelines and watch due to fouls. The United States fell behind by 19 points in the first quarter, and although they narrowed the gap at one point in the second quarter, they quickly fell behind again, ending the first half 17 points behind and in a dangerous situation. Please continue reading.</p> <p>In the past, when the situation was critical for the United States, they usually relied on their physicality and depth to make a comeback in the second half. However, Lithuania had many capable players at their disposal. With a rotation of 10 players, excluding Gabrielius Mald\u016bnas, who did not play the entire game, and Deividas Sirvydis, who only played for a little over six minutes (he scored 2 points!), Lithuania's rotation was not inferior to that of the United States.</p> <p>Moreover, most of these players belong to the younger generation who can play in top leagues, and they have a certain level of experience, skills, and competitiveness. The advantages that the United States is accustomed to have been weakened to a low point, and even though they fought hard to catch up, they still fell short. Just when fans thought the game was about to enter garbage time, the United States did not give up, and they deserve applause.</p> <p>Even though they were significantly behind, these players still gave their all. In the third quarter, they accelerated their offense and exerted full defensive pressure, twice narrowing the score to just four points.</p> <p>With less than 10 seconds left and trailing by four points, they even managed to steal the ball. Furthermore, a wide-open three-pointer appeared at the baseline. If that shot had gone in, the outcome of the game would have been uncertain. Although their defense allowed Lithuania to shoot over 50% from three-point range, they still created turnovers, resulting in Lithuania committing 19 turnovers throughout the game.</p> <p>Anthony Edwards, the leading scorer for the United States, once again scored a high of 35 points on 26 attempts, showing the dominance of a team's top player.</p> <p>The impressive blocks from Tyrese Haliburton and Brandon Ingram, and the players diving on the floor for every possible loose ball, they fought until the last moment, and they can be proud of themselves even in defeat.</p>"},{"location":"20231001091301478198/","title":"NBA Opening Ceremony Interrupted by Fan Embracing Michael Porter Jr","text":"<p>NBA Opening Ceremony Interrupted by Fan Embracing Michael Porter Jr. </p> <p>September 9, 2023, 18:25 - NBA Denver Nuggets forward Michael Porter Jr. visited Taiwan to participate in a charity event.

The NBA rest policy has five main directions: besides the previous requirement that teams with multiple star players cannot rest them simultaneously, the NBA also applies the same standard to teams with star players, requiring players to be free from obvious injuries and not to miss important games (mid-season invitation games, national broadcasts in the United States), and personal awards have a requirement of playing in at least 65 games to be eligible for selection.</p> <p>According to the player list compiled by ESPN reporter Bobby Marks, the list includes players who have been selected for the All-Star Game and All-NBA Team in the past three years.

Lillard had expressed his desire to stay with the Trail Blazers but was rejected.</p> <p>The Damian Lillard trade was completed early yesterday morning, generating significant discussion throughout the league. Today, reporter Chris Haynes wrote a lengthy article detailing the developments of the past few months regarding the Lillard trade.</p> <p>Haynes chronologically describes the sequence of events. After Lillard expressed his desire for a trade, communication between the Heat and the Trail Blazers was limited to the summer league in early July. Subsequent attempts to have face-to-face discussions about the trade did not materialize.</p> <p>At this point, the Trail Blazers released a statement indicating that they would seek the best offer and were not limited to the Miami Heat. Lillard's camp made it clear that he would not be satisfied unless it was a move to the Heat. The league intervened to mediate the situation. However, there was no news about this matter after the summer league. Lillard's agent, Aaron Goodwin, took action and suggested that Lillard have a conversation with general manager Joe Cronin. Both agreed to meet. During the meeting, Lillard expressed his disappointment with how the situation was being handled, and Cronin assured him that he would pursue the most attractive package. At that moment, Lillard knew that it was unlikely for him to go to the Heat.</p> <p>Haynes further wrote in the article that during the meeting, Lillard even told Cronin, \"If there's no way to go to the Heat, then he would rather withdraw the trade and return to the Trail Blazers.\" Cronin responded directly, stating that Lillard could not return to the team. Naturally, Lillard was surprised to hear this news and felt extremely frustrated about not being able to return to Portland. Lillard still believed that he might not leave the Trail Blazers, so he continued training at the team's facility.

With the first offseason under the new agreement, there have been significant changes in the league's ecosystem and operations due to rule changes   Discussion on the first offseason of the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement (CBA): Who benefits and who loses?</p> <p>The new version of the NBA's collective bargaining agreement, known as the CBA, went into effect on July 1st! With the first offseason under the new agreement, there have been significant changes in the league's ecosystem and operations due to rule changes. As we look back on the first offseason under the new CBA, who has benefited and who has suffered? The end of superteams? As I mentioned in my article at the end of June, with the implementation of the second Apron (Super Tax), many powerhouse teams cannot avoid the fate of salary clean-up. Examples include the Warriors trading Jordan Poole, the Clippers giving up on Eric Gordon, and the Hawks selling John Collins.</p> <p>The Phoenix Suns, however, have shown a completely opposite approach. They traded Wizards star Bradley Beal before the new CBA took effect, maximizing their cap space. This may be the last super team in the NBA for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Under the new CBA, once a team's total salary exceeds the second Apron, they can no longer use the mid-level exception or sign-and-trade, and the flexibility of trade amounts will be restricted. The future first-round draft picks will directly become the 30th pick, making the cost much heavier than the luxury tax.</p> <p>While it may be worth taking risks in the short term for a championship, it will be challenging to maintain a roster with three superstars (whose salaries account for more than 30% of the cap) in the long term.</p> <p>Take the Suns as an example. Kevin Durant and Beal will account for approximately 35% of the cap in the upcoming season, while Devin Booker will be at 26%. However, starting from the 2024-25 season, with the new contracts in effect, their salaries will collectively exceed the cap by approximately 105%, putting them in an overflow state. From a salary perspective alone, Deandre Ayton's contract will likely need to be traded. I believe the Suns will not be able to sustain the trio of superstars for long and will have to face the reality in the short term. The next team facing a salary crisis is the Timberwolves. They signed Anthony Edwards to a five-year, $259 million extension this summer, effective from the 2024-25 season. When combined with Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert's contracts, they will consume 90% of the salary cap. Unless the Timberwolves can rapidly grow and prove that their twin towers can compete for a championship, they will soon face the punishment of the second Apron. The Clippers, who already have an exploding salary cap, must make decisions in the new season and expedite the turnover of their high-priced veteran players like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard to alleviate the salary pressure.</p> <p>This year and the next will be a transitional period, where powerhouse teams will have to slow down and adjust their rosters. They will no longer be able to use the \"silver bullet\" strategy to strengthen their teams. Teams like the Suns, Timberwolves, Warriors, and Clippers may find more suitable role players through trades, but it will be challenging to sustain their current salary levels for an extended period. If they don't trade high-salary players, they will have to face rebuilding. However, don't worry, I believe the resilient NBA executives will still be able to form super teams. However, if they fail to win a championship, the fall will be even more painful than before.</p> <p>Less financially strong teams will benefit from the more flexible trade and signing exceptions under the new CBA. Many trade restrictions have been eased, and more exceptions can be used as long as the team's total salary is below the two Apron thresholds. The Cavaliers, for example, saved up to $7.5 million in the price difference to complete the sign-and-trade for Max Strus (4 years, $63 million). Under the old rules, the Cavaliers would have had to offer a higher-priced contract to the Heat. The Rockets also benefited from this new rule by signing Dillon Brooks. Second-round picks now have their own exceptions.</p> <p>Unlike first-round picks with standardized contracts, second-round picks previously had to use salary cap space or split the mid-level exception to sign 3-4 year contracts. The new second-round exception clause solves this problem.</p> <p>The Kings used this exception to sign Colby Jones, the 34th pick, to a 4-year, $8.76 million contract, while the Hawks signed Mouhamed Gueye, the 39th pick, to a 4-year, $7.63 million contract with a team option in the last year. This is seen as a solution to avoid a repeat of the \"Jalen Brunson situation.\" If the team does not exercise the last year of the contract, the player becomes a restricted free agent, giving them the right to receive offers from other teams, unlike Brunson, who had to watch as the Mavericks let him go. In 2021, the Nuggets signed Michael Porter Jr. to a designated rookie contract extension worth $179.29 million over 5 years, which sparked a discussion. Previously, teams were limited to two designated players, but with the new version of the CBA, this restriction has been removed, and first-round picks can now sign 5-year contracts without any conditions.</p> <p>Therefore, we see players like Desmond Bane of the Grizzlies signing a 5-year, $197.23 million contract, slightly below the 25% max salary, but still a long-term deal.</p> <p>This is a sign that the NBA is encouraging the draft and the development of rookies, giving the home team more incentives and conditions to retain young players.</p> <p>Restricted free agents have a tough time. While the advantage of re-signing with the home team is amplified, it also diminishes the player's bargaining power, especially when they become restricted free agents. We saw this with Deandre Ayton last year, and this year with P.J. Washington and Austin Reaves, who entered the market as restricted free agents but chose to accept new contracts from their respective teams instead of seeking offers from other teams. According to rumors, the Spurs initially planned to offer Reaves a contract worth $100 million over 4 years or $60 million over 3 years. However, when they heard that the Lakers were interested, they didn't even make an offer. In the end, Reaves received a 4-year, $56 million contract from the Lakers.</p> <p>Washington, on the other hand, waited for offers from other teams but ended up without any, choosing to sign a 3-year, $48 million contract with the Hornets.</p> <p>The issue is not the reasonable value of Washington and Reaves' contracts but rather the weakened bargaining power of restricted free agents. Because the home team has the unconditional right to match any offer, other teams must offer slightly higher contracts to deter the home team. In Washington's case, some teams may have deemed it not cost-effective. If a player is attractive enough, like Reaves, who had interest from the Lakers, why would other teams waste their time? The back and forth between the player and the home team usually results in the player not getting the ideal contract value. In terms of specifications, Washington and Reaves could have chosen to accept the qualifying offer (QO) and become unrestricted free agents after one more year, but it would come with the risk of entering the free market. An interesting exception is that restricted free agents can also be used as a way to mess with other teams. The Jazz made an offer to Paul Reed, the backup center for the 76ers, for 3 years and $23 million, with a rare condition that the contract is fully guaranteed in the first season, but if the team reaches the second round of the playoffs, the following two years will also become fully guaranteed. However, it will be challenging for the rebuilding Jazz to meet this condition, while the 76ers have a higher chance of making it to the second round.</p> <p>In the free market, things are chilly. Apart from re-signings, only Max Strus, Bruce Brown Jr., Fred VanVleet, and Dillon Brooks have received new contracts exceeding the full mid-level exception.</p> <p>If we exclude Strus, there are only around 7-10 teams that can clear enough cap space to sign eight-figure contracts, and only the Pacers and Rockets are willing to spend.</p> <p>Analyzing the strategies of these two teams, it is clear that they are not truly strengthening their teams but rather focusing on filling the salary floor. The contracts of Brown Jr. and VanVleet include team-friendly options.</p> <p>The new game rules under the new CBA clearly encourage trades and raise the conditions for re-signing. When players can earn a significant amount by staying with their home team, more players are willing to commit to long-term contracts, resulting in fewer players entering the free market. This also fills up the salary cap space of various teams before the offseason even starts.</p> <p>Since 2018-2019, apart from Fred VanVleet receiving a max contract this year, the last player to sign a max contract in free agency relying on cap space was Kawhi Leonard in 2019 and LeBron James in 2018. Most players have had to rely on trades or re-signings.</p> <p>The new version of the CBA requires teams to reach the salary floor threshold on the first day of the season; otherwise, they cannot participate in the luxury tax distribution. This has put pressure on teams to spend money in the offseason. While teams like the Pacers and Rockets have offered inflated contracts, many rebuilding teams have filled their cap space through trades and invested in functional veteran players.</p> <p>Instead of conducting large-scale experiments with cap space as they did in the past, many rebuilding teams this offseason have been able to reap rewards, providing better development opportunities for young players and making the games more exciting.</p>"},{"location":"20231002091304931800/","title":"Bronny James and Shareef O'Neal both live in the shadow of their famous fathers and face heart problems","text":"<p>Bronny James and Shareef O'Neal both live in the shadow of their famous fathers and face heart problems.</p> <p>Article: Yesterday, Bronny James, the eldest son of LeBron James, suddenly collapsed while practicing and experienced a momentary cardiac arrest. Fortunately, he was promptly rushed to the hospital and is now out of intensive care. However, this collapse may jeopardize all the efforts he has made so far.</p> <p>As the son of LeBron, Bronny has had to face greater attention and pressure than other \"basketball second-generation\" players. After all, he is not just the son of a player, but the son of a basketball legend with a historical position in the NBA. Naturally, his basketball talent would be scrutinized more closely. However, compared to his father's high school years, Bronny's dominance is not as impressive as LeBron's. Although he still has good innate abilities, he has not displayed the same level of dominance in high school basketball as his father did. At one point, he was even considered a \"chip off the old block.\" But despite the unfriendly criticism from the outside world, Bronny persevered and continued to improve his skills. In his senior season, he averaged 14.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists, and was selected to the McDonald's All-American High School Basketball Team. He was given the title of a five-star high school player by some basketball media and received basketball scholarships from some NCAA Division I schools.</p> <p>These achievements have significantly boosted Bronny's draft prediction, going from a possibility of not being selected to having the chance to compete for a first-round or even lottery pick.</p> <p>Some may argue that this is due to the influence of his father LeBron's fame. LeBron has also mentioned that if Bronny enters the NBA, he has a high chance of joining his son's team to play together.</p> <p>This \"selecting son to send father\" move undoubtedly has an impact on Bronny's market value, but we must not ignore Bronny's own efforts. He ultimately chose the University of Southern California and plans to enter the NBA draft after completing his freshman season. Before enrolling, he posted on his social media, expressing his determination to prove the doubters wrong.</p> <p>However, the heart problem that arises before the start of the new college season casts a shadow over his future. If his NBA path is hindered by heart issues, it reminds me of another \"basketball second-generation\" player, Shareef O'Neal, the son of basketball star \"The Big Shaq\" Shaquille O'Neal.</p> <p>During his high school years, Shareef did achieve some notable results and was recognized as a four-star high school player by sports media. He was also planning to enter the NBA after completing his freshman season. However, during his freshman year, he was diagnosed with a heart abnormality that posed a high risk to his life and required emergency surgery. The post-surgery rest and rehabilitation forced Shareef to be away from high-intensity games for a whole 11 months, which was a setback for a rising player.</p> <p>Losing a year during the crucial development period can significantly impact one's skills and competitiveness. With Shareef's condition, he was no longer a dominant force in the more intense NCAA games. Coaches in college were also cautious due to the risk of relapse and the consideration of team performance. This led to a decline in his college performance, and ultimately, he faced the fate of not being drafted.</p> <p>\"I always tell Shareef that he will never be the next me.\" \"I want him to play his own game, his own style.\" \"Fortunately or unfortunately, he has to carry the name O'Neal, but he still needs to create his own path.\" \"At that time, I had the pressure to succeed because I needed to improve my life.\" \"But Shareef doesn't have that pressure, so I hope he can find his own goals.\" Currently, Shareef is still developing in the league, waiting for opportunities. Despite averaging only 5.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 assist in the last season, overcoming the shadow of his heart problem is still a significant progress. Shaquille also encourages his son not to be tied down by his father's achievements and reputation but to bravely pursue his own chosen path. I believe LeBron sees Bronny in the same way, that regardless of the impact on his draft position, it will not affect LeBron's love for his child. He also hopes that Bronny will not be affected by injuries and will showcase his worth in the upcoming season. This article is published with permission from the author.

Photo / New Taipei Kings Provided New Taipei Kings, in preparation for the new season and the Eastern Super League, announced on September 8th that they have signed power forward Billy Preston from the United States, making him the third import player for the Forbidden Guards. It is hoped that Billy, who is young but has experience playing in multiple professional basketball leagues, can contribute to the Forbidden Guards on both ends of the court.</p> <p>Billy hails from California and is currently 25 years old, standing at a height of 208 centimeters. He was selected as a five-star high school player during his student years and received recruitment offers from prestigious NCAA school, the University of Kansas. His remarkable athleticism is his trademark, and he also possesses excellent shooting skills from the outside. His exceptional ability to penetrate often leads to creating good scoring opportunities. In 2018, he entered the NBA draft but did not receive much attention. Subsequently, he played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the summer league and signed a two-way contract to play for their G League team, the Cleveland Charge. This marked the beginning of his professional career. He then played in various overseas professional leagues, most recently playing for the Cape Town Tigers in the South African Basketball League, where he averaged 16.6 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. Regarding Billy's signing, General Manager Mao Gaen said, \"Billy can be considered a modern-day stretch four player. He possesses excellent athletic ability and has the skills to both cut and shoot, making him a formidable offensive threat. His agility and height also provide the Forbidden Guards with defensive intensity. At only 25 years old, he is a young player with unlimited potential. We are very excited to see how he combines with Mulens and Manny in the upcoming season, and we believe he will bring more flexibility to the Kings' lineup and help the team achieve even better results.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231002091427874270/","title":"PLG Dreamers to host Dream Collaboration Exchange Match; Five teams gather at Mini Egg Fantasy for battle","text":"<p>The PLG Dreamers announced today that they will be hosting the \"Dream Collaboration\" exchange match, bringing together teams from two leagues   PLG Dreamers to host Dream Collaboration Exchange Match; Five teams gather at Mini Egg Fantasy for battle </p> <p>The PLG Dreamers announced today that they will be hosting the \"Dream Collaboration\" exchange match, bringing together teams from two leagues.

The score was tied at 47 points as they entered the second half. The defensive intensity increased in the second half, and Serbia committed too many offensive mistakes. Within the first six minutes of the third quarter, Serbia only scored 6 points, allowing Germany to establish an 11-point lead. The Wagner brothers played a crucial role in extending the lead to 12 points, with Franz Wagner hitting a three-pointer and Moritz Wagner scoring under the basket. In the final quarter, Serbia launched a comeback effort, with Aleksa Avramovic and Filip Petrusev scoring consecutively. Germany called a timeout. Avramovic continued to perform well after the timeout, scoring another five points. However, Johannes Voigtmann's three-pointer from the corner stopped Serbia's momentum. In the last two minutes, after Serbia called a timeout, Avramovic once again contributed to his team with a three-pointer and a drawn foul beyond the arc, narrowing the gap to 3 points from a 9-point difference before the timeout. In a crucial moment, Germany called a timeout but made an offensive mistake afterward. Marko Guduric's three-pointer missed, preventing Serbia from tying the game directly.</p> <p>After Germany's counterattack, Serbia committed a foul. Schroder made one of the two free throws.

What's remarkable is that he achieved this record with an impressive 41.1% three-point shooting percentage, proving himself to be a quality shooter. This success can be attributed to the Kings' tactical system and offensive configuration that emphasizes speed, space, and the support of teammates like Domantas Sabonis and De'Aaron Fox.</p> <p>According to BBall-Index, among the top 10% of players who played over 1,000 minutes and ranked in three-point percentage and made shots, only Joe Harris, Jevon Carter, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Malcolm Brogdon had better three-point shot quality than Keegan. Behind his high shooting percentage, in addition to his excellent shooting touch, credit should be given to the favorable shooting environment provided by the team. Despite the Kings' first playoff appearance in 16 years, they faced a tough opponent, the defending champion Golden State Warriors, and in the high-pressure and intense defensive series, rookie Keegan Murray had limited contributions in the first three games, averaging only 3.3 points and 4 rebounds. However, unexpectedly, Keegan showed his evolution in the following games and helped the team extend the series to a seventh game.</p> <p>Continuing with the regular season, where Keegan only averaged 4.6 rebounds, he showcased his rebounding ability in the next four games. Not only did he average 8 rebounds per game, but he also improved his scoring performance, scoring double digits in all four games with an average of 14.5 points. Although the Kings ultimately lost the series, Keegan's presence in the later games of the playoffs raised expectations among the coaching staff and fans for his performance in the upcoming season.</p> <p>Visible Transformation: Every summer is a turning point for NBA players' transformations, and last summer, Fox, who had just gotten married, continued to train hard even during his honeymoon. This allowed him to have a breakout season in the 22-23 season. As Keegan enters his first offseason, he has not been idle. He has been training alongside Fox and even taking on the role of a mentor.</p> <p>This has sparked even greater anticipation for Keegan's offseason development under the guidance of Fox, similar to the evolution seen in Fox's previous season. Keegan mentioned in an interview that they have had multiple one-on-one matchups during their offseason training. For Keegan, who showed limited individual offensive abilities during his rookie season, this is undoubtedly a great opportunity for him to hone his skills. Although Keegan humbly admitted that he has not won a single game against Fox during their training sessions, fans have already seen what they wanted to see during the California Classic hosted by the Kings.</p> <p>Although Keegan had an extremely efficient performance in perimeter shooting and catch-and-shoot three-pointers last season, with a remarkable 97.6% of his three-pointers being assisted, there were doubts about his ability to develop self-created offense at the NBA level. While sharpshooters with high-quality shooting skills have a place in the modern NBA that emphasizes space, developing the ability to create their own offense and generate space would elevate Keegan's offensive impact. Keegan indeed responded to everyone's expectations during the California Classic. In the first game against the Golden State Warriors, he scored a game-high 29 points. Shortly after the start of the game, he showcased his ball-handling and driving ability, finishing with a one-handed dunk that ignited the Kings fans in attendance. Even teammates Malik Monk and Davion Mitchell on the sidelines were amazed because they knew firsthand that Keegan didn't have these types of plays where he brought the ball up the court and performed coast-to-coast dunks throughout the previous year.</p> <p>Keegan Murray creates space with a stepback and knocks down the shot.

Tseng Wen-ting, the 39-year-old veteran, admitted that although the team had a long training period and showed visible improvement, it was still \"not enough\". After starting training in June this year, the Chinese Taipei men's basketball team underwent training in Japan, participated in the Jones Cup, and then went to Australia for two weeks before evaluating their performance in the Hangzhou Asian Games. Although they won their first game against Hong Kong, their offense broke down in the first half today, leading to a 20-point defeat. Tseng Wen-ting, who returned to the national team, frankly said, \"We have had such a long training period, and there has been improvement, but honestly, it's not enough. We need to get better and elevate everyone within the limited time.\"</p> <p>Tseng Wen-ting pointed out the problem, mentioning that all the players in the Chinese Taipei team are main players in their respective clubs, but when they enter the national team, they need to switch roles and mindsets, and find ways to help the team within the limited time and possession.</p> <p>The Chinese Taipei team has been plagued by injuries in the backcourt this year. The original main point guard, Chen Ying-jun, was absent from the Asian Games due to injury, which forced shooting guard Lin Ting-chien, who usually plays a scoring role, to step up as the team's commander. He rated his performance as a point guard today with 7 assists as \"unsatisfactory\". There were many deficiencies in the first two games of the group stage, and they still need to reflect and strengthen. Lin Ting-chien, 23, participated in the CBA draft in 2020 and showcased his skills with the Tianjin Ronggang Pioneer team. In July, he announced the signing of a 3-year maximum contract extension with Tianjin. Today, he has also become the focus of attention for the Chinese media. Lin Ting-chien mentioned that after three seasons in the CBA, he expected to face high-intensity physical confrontations today. The actual game on the court was not much different from the CBA, but the atmosphere of the Asian Games and the CBA league were completely different, and the referee's standards also varied. It was still a different experience.</p>"},{"location":"20231003091317380013/","title":"NBA star Carmelo Anthony, also known as \"Melon,\" announced his retirement from basketball in a heartfelt video on Twitter","text":"<p>NBA star Carmelo Anthony, also known as \"Melon,\" announced his retirement from basketball in a heartfelt video on Twitter. After 19 seasons in the league, Anthony, who will turn 39 next week, decided to hang up his sneakers.

Among them, Anthony is the only one who did not win an NBA championship. His prime years were with the Nuggets and Knicks, but his teams couldn't achieve the expected results due to his offensive-minded style of play. As injuries and age took a toll on his performance, his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game since joining the Thunder in the 2017-18 season, breaking his streak of 14 consecutive seasons with over 20 points per game.

Head coach Brian Goorjian, who is now 70 years old, is originally from the United States. After graduating from college in 1977, he came to Melbourne and played for the Melbourne Tigers until 1988 when he became the head coach. He can be considered a coach among coaches, having coached players such as Matthew Nielsen, Andrew Gaze, Shane Heal, C.J. Bruton, and Mark Worthington. Many of the players he coached, as well as opponents' players, have now become well-known Australian players, including Dante Exum and Ben Simmons.</p> <p>The three assistant coaches on the Australian team also have notable backgrounds. Matthew Nielsen, in particular, is well-known in recent Australian basketball history as one of the most representative interior players. He has also had years of experience playing in Europe and has served as an assistant and head coach for the Austin Spurs. Starting in 2021, he joined the San Antonio Spurs.</p> <p>Adam Caporn has played a crucial role in recent years as a key figure in Australian players' journey to the United States. Before Caporn, players like Nielsen followed a more European path, balancing high school and college education while playing in local leagues and the National Basketball League (NBL). Caporn joined St. Mary's College in California in 2001, becoming a senior player on the team alongside the team's first import, Jonathan Sanders. At the time, St. Mary's was a young program under head coach Randy Bennett, with only around 2,000 students and a modest history in the NCAA tournament. One of the most famous basketball alumni from the school is Mahershala Ali, who has won two Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor.</p> <p>After Caporn graduated, he helped Australian players find another path to St. Mary's, resulting in a series of Australian players such as Patty Mills, Matthew Dellavedova, Stephen Holt, and Clint Steindl transforming the small college into a mid-major powerhouse on the West Coast. The team even ranked in the preseason Top 25 in the United States.</p> <p>Another coach with deep connections to Australia is David Patrick. Although he is also originally from the United States, he played a crucial role in bringing Australian players to St. Mary's alongside Caporn. Any team he has been with for more than a season has left a significant mark of Australian players. He is also known for his recruitment skills and connections. He is the godfather of Ben Simmons, helping Simmons secure a spot at LSU in 2013. When Patrick was at TCU, he recruited Kouat Noi, and during his time as head coach at UC Riverside, he brought in five Australian players. Currently, he is with Sacramento State and has brought four players with him. This is Patrick's first time coaching the national team for the entire tournament. In the past, Goorjian has mentioned that the Australian national team cannot do without Ben Simmons, but this year he has hinted that Simmons may still be considered, though the undisclosed reasons behind this change remain a mystery.</p> <p>Dante Exum, who has struggled with injuries throughout his career, had a breakthrough season with the Belgrade Guerrillas, averaging 13.2 points, 2.7 assists, and shooting 52% from the field and 39% from three-point range in 23 minutes per game. After being involved in a brawl with Guerschon Yabusele, Exum played a total of 74 games in the season, which is the most he has played since 2017.</p> <p>The Australian team has a significant age gap, with players like Dyson Daniels and Josh Giddey being only 20 years old, while Patty Mills and Joe Ingles are already over 35 years old.</p> <p>Patty Mills and Joe Ingles participated in the Jones Cup in 2006, alongside Aron Baynes. Although Baynes was born in New Zealand and initially intended to join the New Zealand national basketball team, he ultimately chose to represent Australia after moving there with his family at the age of three.</p> <p>Aron Baynes, who almost saw his career end last year, had a solid season with the Brisbane Bullets, averaging 11.2 points and 7.6 rebounds in 23 minutes per game. At 36 years old, he still possesses the skills to compete at the NBA level and could potentially continue playing for a few more years.</p> <p>The Australian team also represents a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds. In addition to white Australians, players like Dyson Daniels, Josh Green, Xavier Cooks, and Dante Exum have fathers who immigrated to Australia to play basketball and settled there. Chris Goulding's father is British and came to Australia to play Australian rules football. Matisse Thybulle's father is of Haitian descent, and although he has no ancestral ties to Australia, he chose to naturalize due to his family's seven-year stay in Sydney during his childhood. Duop Reath was born in South Sudan, and team captain Patty Mills has a unique background as he comes from an indigenous Australian and Torres Strait Islander family. The composition of the entire team is a true reflection of the multiculturalism in Australia.</p>"},{"location":"20231003091418008159/","title":"The Miami Heat and the Portland Trail Blazers are expected to resume trade negotiations, with the Heat hesitating on whether to include Caleb Martin in the package","text":"<p>The Miami Heat and the Portland Trail Blazers are expected to resume trade negotiations, with the Heat hesitating on whether to include Caleb Martin in the package.

However, based on the performance in the Jones Cup, it seems that they have not found a suitable candidate to replace the starting lineup. With the confirmation that Chen Ying-Jun cannot participate in the Asian Games, Zeng Wen-Ding has been included in the roster. The question is whether Li De-Wei, who has shown good organizational skills, and Zeng Xiang-Jun, who is more agile in offense and defense, will lose the opportunity to take over the inside position. Let's analyze the statement further. Please continue reading.</p> <p>From the evolution of the tactics in the Jones Cup, we can see that Li De-Wei and Zeng Xiang-Jun have overlapping roles. In addition to naturalized player Ater Majok being the pillar in the inside position, there are also six local players available, including Li De-Wei, Zeng Xiang-Jun, and Chen Guan-Quan as the main substitutes, and Zhou Bo-Xun, Zeng Wen-Ding, and Wang Hao-Ji as backup options. This strengthens the team's defense in the paint. However, the average rebound per game for the local players is only 7.9, with a total of 38 rebounds per game, excluding Ater Majok's contribution of 10.5 rebounds. This means that the team has not solidified the paint area as well as expected. Moreover, with a shortage of guards, the organization of the offense has become a major challenge, which in turn affects the selection of inside players. This will be a dilemma that the team will face in the Asian Games.</p> <p>Li De-Wei has been a regular starter in the previous games, providing ball-handling skills in the inside position to alleviate the pressure on Lin Ting-Qian, who is playing as a substitute point guard. He often plays in the high post or top of the key, using hand-offs and screens to create opportunities. The \"Chicago Action\" tactic highlights his unique characteristics among these inside players.</p> <p>As shown in the table above, Li De-Wei has performed well in terms of assists and rebounding against the Philippines and Japan. Although he lacks agility, he has the height and physicality to defend well in the paint. He contributes an average of 1.4 blocks per game, which is impressive.</p> <p>However, his scoring has been limited, with a maximum of only 5 points in a single game. As the team's tactics gradually changed, he was put on the bench for rotation. The key moment was the game against Qatar, where the pick-and-roll combination of Lin Ting-Qian and Ater Majok opened up a new path, shifting the focus from high post ball-handling and attempting to involve the power forward in the attack to provide more options.</p> <p>Although Li De-Wei can shoot from the outside, his shot speed is not fast. He is capable of back-to-the-basket post-ups, but lacks the skills and agility to outplay his opponents. His efficiency in following up on offensive rebounds is not good, and his offensive contributions mainly come from receiving small passes and second-chance points. The recent deviation in his plus-minus value proves that his effectiveness on the court is decreasing, and his role is becoming somewhat unclear.</p> <p>Now, let's talk about an episode from the Jones Cup. Zeng Xiang-Jun expressed his dissatisfaction with his playing time on social media. Although he had fewer opportunities to play in the early games, his statistics were not bad, and he efficiently completed his tasks. His performance was comparable to the average, proving his stability.</p> <p>As mentioned before, with Lin Ting-Qian leading the offense, there is a greater demand for the power forward position to contribute on offense. Zeng Xiang-Jun, who is quick in shooting from the outside, agile in movement, and has enough impact, has become the preferred option in the lineup. He made 2 three-pointers against the UAE and the United States, and scored in double digits in the last four games, with a plus-minus value of 33 against South Korea. He creates more space for the team's half-court offense and increases the fast-break capabilities, providing more offensive options for the Chinese team.</p> <p>Agility is Zeng Xiang-Jun's advantage as an inside player. With a height of 205 cm and a weight of 95 kg, he has a well-proportioned body that allows him to play as a stretch five or in a small-ball lineup. He has good awareness in following up on plays and has offensive skills in the mid-range, making him more suitable for the modern basketball trend in both offense and defense. Unless there are significant changes in the coaching staff, Zeng Xiang-Jun will always be the preferred choice in the lineup. However, his average of 0.9 assists and 0.7 blocks per game shows that he is mainly a scorer, and his court vision and passing skills need improvement. He has limited effectiveness in connecting with the center position, which is why his playing time is restricted. Additionally, he still needs to develop his awareness in setting screens to provide more options for the coach. </p> <p>To sum up, Zeng Xiang-Jun and Li De-Wei are two completely different types of players in the local inside positions for the Chinese Men's Basketball team. One focuses on defense and playmaking, while the other excels in offense and speed. Both players bring different offensive and defensive styles to the team. In the Jones Cup, the playing time of these two players alternated, not because of their performance, but because of the tactical emphasis on ball handling. However, it can be confirmed that they will be the main forces in the Asian Games, alongside the naturalized foreign players.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, with the presence of the three CBA stars and quality local point guards, it would be clear who would start and come off the bench. However, injuries have caused changes in the lineup, making it both open and unpredictable. After Chen Ying-Jun's withdrawal from the Asian Games, Wu Yong-Sheng was brought in as a substitute, but the lack of a point guard is evident. Lin Ting-Qian still needs to play as the main point guard, and Zeng Wen-Ding's inclusion in the roster leaves no doubt about the choice of local inside players. It is certain that, except for Zeng Xiang-Jun, the other inside players will have limited playing opportunities. Despite being 39 years old, Zeng Wen-Ding's efficient playing style, basketball IQ, and ball-handling skills are necessary to win games. Unless other position players have a good shooting touch, he will likely play around 20 minutes. The constant changes in the roster have brought disappointment, as the pursuit of medals is important, but sacrificing the future is not an option.</p>"},{"location":"20231003091457390902/","title":"Jeremy Lin officially joins New Taipei Kings - this moment has been discussed with his brother for 30 years","text":"<p>This article is written by the podcast program \"Half Time\"    Jeremy Lin officially joins New Taipei Kings - this moment has been discussed with his brother for 30 years</p> <p>This article is written by the podcast program \"Half Time\".

The top three picks had their own unique characteristics. Victor Wembanyama, known as the \"French Monster,\" was expected to be the first overall pick and he fulfilled that expectation by being selected by the San Antonio Spurs. Standing at 7 feet 5 inches (226 cm) tall with an 8-foot wingspan (243 cm), Wembanyama possesses remarkable physical attributes. Not only that, he also has the shooting touch of a guard and the mobility of a forward, making him the clear favorite for the top pick for months.</p> <p>Wembanyama becomes the third number one pick in Spurs' history, following in the footsteps of David Robinson in 1987 and Tim Duncan in 1997.

Although he was chosen by the Charlotte Hornets, ESPN reported that during his workout with the Hornets, he told the team owner, the basketball legend Michael Jordan, that he is not his idol and has rarely watched Jordan play. Miller's journey to becoming the second pick was full of twists and turns. A year ago, he was projected to be a second-round pick or even go undrafted. However, Miller improved his skills and played for the number one seed in the NCAA men's basketball tournament, the University of Alabama, which propelled him into the lottery conversation.</p> <p>However, in February of this year, Miller was unexpectedly involved in a shooting incident with his college teammate.

He also has the ability to shoot from mid to long-range, and his ability to grab offensive rebounds and make dunks is impressive. His shot-blocking ability is also excellent. Bigby-Williams has represented the UK in U18 and U20 competitions and has delivered an average of \"double-double\" in U20 games. After graduating, he entered the NBA draft but was not selected by any team. He then played in the NBA G League and competed in various European leagues such as Italy, Belgium, Poland, and France, as well as the Venezuelan professional basketball league. He recently represented the UK in the EuroBasket and the World Cup.</p> <p>In college, Bigby-Williams attended NJCAA D1 Gillette College, where he achieved a \"double-double\" in scoring and rebounding in his rookie year. In his second year, he averaged 16.8 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 5.6 blocks per game, earning him the title of NJCAA Player of the Year. He then transferred to NCAA Division I powerhouse Louisiana State University (LSU), where he played alongside NBA center Naz Reid, forming a formidable \"twin towers\" combination.</p> <p>In the Dragon Ball series, Goku represents righteousness, while the Great Demon King Piccolo represents evil. With their combination, their energy will be maximized, and Bigby-Williams will become the Great Demon King guarding the Iron Man's restricted zone, utilizing his excellent spatial awareness to create more opportunities on the offensive end.</p> <p>Head coach Qiu Dazong commented on the addition of Bigby-Williams to the Iron Man's restricted zone, saying, \"Bigby-Williams operates between power forward and center on the offensive end, with active and clear offensive skills. He is also able to actively create opportunities for the team. On the defensive end, he has an aggressive and resolute fighting spirit. We hope that Bigby-Williams can lead the Iron Man in both offense and defense and strive for the best results.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231004091233975664/","title":"The NBA league announced the suspension of Josh Primo, a player from the San Antonio Spurs, for four games due to inappropriate behavior","text":"<p>The NBA league announced the suspension of Josh Primo, a player from the San Antonio Spurs, for four games due to inappropriate behavior.

If Curry does play for such a long time, there is a good chance that his career three-point total could surpass 4,000.</p> <p>Please continue reading. 4,000 is an astonishing number and breaking this record is considered nearly impossible in the NBA, even if there is a chance, it would likely take a very long time.</p> <p>However, interestingly, there is a player currently in the league quietly chasing this Hall of Fame-level superstar shooter, and his name is not a household name in the NBA, nor is he a player that casual fans would immediately think of as a star player.</p> <p>That's right, it's not James Harden. Although Harden, currently ranked third, has a chance this season to move up to second in the all-time three-pointers list, his career three-point shooting percentage of 36.3% and his age of 34 make it difficult for him to catch up. It's also not Luka Doncic. He may have a chance to surpass 3,000 career three-pointers, but to reach the 4,000 level, his current career three-point shooting percentage of 33.8% needs to improve to another level.</p> <p>Some might guess Damian Lillard and Paul George, both known for their elite shooting accuracy. Currently ranked 10th and 26th, respectively, they have a chance to reach the top five in NBA history. However, like Harden, they are both 33 years old and already in the later stages of their prime, making it difficult for them to catch up to Curry.</p> <p>Many might guess Klay Thompson, Curry's teammate currently ranked 18th in the three-pointers leaderboard. Thompson indeed had a chance, but two major injuries significantly slowed down his progress. If it weren't for those two major injuries, he might have already surpassed 2,300 three-pointers and secured the sixth spot while still in his prime. However, Thompson is also reaching the age of 34, making it equally challenging for him to keep up with Curry's pace. Please continue reading. So, who is the most likely candidate? You read it right, it's Buddy Hield.</p> <p>Photo source: Getty Images. Hield, currently playing for the Pacers, has a career three-point shooting percentage of 40.2%. In the past five seasons, Hield ranked second in total three-pointers made for four seasons and fourth for one season.</p> <p>Since the 2017-18 season, no player, including Curry, has made more three-pointers than Hield's 1,557. In the past five seasons, Hield has averaged 276 three-pointers made per season. If he can maintain the same level in the 2023-24 season, he will move up from 29th to 17th in the all-time list. If he can maintain it for another season, he will surpass Dirk Nowitzki and become 16th. If he can make a few more and reach 284, he will surpass Jason Kidd and become 15th. In the 2022-23 season, Hield made 288 three-pointers, second only to Thompson's 301.</p> <p>Hield is currently 30 years old and has played at least 70 games in each of the past six seasons. He played 80 games in four seasons and missed only three games in the past two seasons.</p> <p>Please continue reading. Let's assume Hield and Curry can both play until they are 40 years old. That means Curry has about five more seasons, while Hield has 10. Hield's average three-pointers per season have already surpassed Curry's (around 243). If Hield can maintain an average of 276 three-pointers per season until he is 40, his career total will be close to 4,500. If Curry can maintain a season average of 300 three-pointers for the next five years, he will accumulate around 4,890 three-pointers by the time he's 40, which is still far more than Hield. However, this is an overly optimistic assumption, as Curry's injuries and declining skills will undoubtedly have an impact. As long as Hield can have a few breakout seasons in the coming years, he may have a chance to get closer to, or even challenge, Curry's record. Nevertheless, it remains extremely difficult for Hield to surpass Curry's record due to the significant gap in shooting consistency between them. Throughout Hield's nine-year career, he has only had four seasons with a three-point shooting percentage above 40%. In contrast, Curry, excluding his injury-plagued 2019-20 season, has only had one season with a three-point shooting percentage below 40%.</p> <p>But based on his current accumulation and form, Hield is the most likely contender. He still has several good years ahead of him, and most importantly, he is very healthy and plays a style of basketball that is less prone to injury. As long as he is willing, he will definitely have playing opportunities in this era of three-point shooting. According to Synergy data from the 2022-23 season, Hield had a spot-up three-point shooting percentage of 45.8%, a pull-up three-point shooting percentage of 42%, a catch-and-shoot three-point shooting percentage of 41.5%, and a step-back three-point shooting percentage of 61.5%. His overall three-point shooting percentage was as high as 42.5%, with his left and right corner three-point shooting percentages reaching 51.1% and 45.7%, respectively.</p>"},{"location":"20231004091402670677/","title":"Impossible becomes possible - thank you Chinese men's basketball team and their 3x3 Asian Games gold medal inspiration","text":"<p>No one could have imagined that the Chinese men's basketball team would achieve the impossible and win a gold medal at the 3x3 Asian Games   Impossible becomes possible - thank you Chinese men's basketball team and their 3x3 Asian Games gold medal inspiration</p> <p>No one could have imagined that the Chinese men's basketball team would achieve the impossible and win a gold medal at the 3x3 Asian Games. As anyone who plays basketball knows, besides the technical aspect, basketball heavily relies on physical attributes. Given Taiwan's ranking in Asian basketball and its genetic makeup, it is difficult to be considered a top contender in high-level international competitions. Please continue reading before the championship game, the Chinese team continuously overcame obstacles and defeated national teams that were initially considered stronger than us, including defeating China in the quarterfinals and a comeback victory against South Korea in the semifinals. The Chinese team solidly defeated these teams that were deemed impossible to beat in a full-court 5-on-5 game.</p> <p>Initially, the Chinese team had already done well, and that was what the author thought before the gold medal game. But the players' appearance on the court in Qatar made the difference even more apparent. The Qatari players were physically strong and muscular, and compared to them, the Chinese team appeared to be lacking in thickness. In my heart, I hoped that we wouldn't lose too embarrassingly and that a silver medal would already be good enough. The game started as expected, with the opponents quickly establishing a 5-point lead with two perimeter players and one under the basket. I thought to myself, \"Well, this is the difference.\"</p> <p>However, fueled by patriotism and my love for 3x3 basketball (which is essentially Taiwan's national sport, as it can be played anywhere), I still hoped that our team would put up a fight.</p> <p>As I watched the Qatari team's accurate shooting from the outside, our team struggled to produce effective offense. I couldn't help but curse in front of the TV, \"Why can't they make shots?\" \"What are we even defending? They're more accurate than us even without playing in the paint.\" Throughout the game, the Chinese team was constantly playing catch-up and fell behind. I believe all Taiwanese fans thought that winning this game would be very difficult. Please continue reading. However, as readers who watched the broadcast know, the Chinese team managed to tie the game in the final minute and, during the last few seconds of the game, a foul was called on Qatar's defense. With Qatar accumulating eight team fouls, Lin Xin-kuan made both free throws, leading to a comeback victory.</p> <p>It was an incredible comeback, a basketball game that no one believed the Chinese team would win at the Asian Games. As the game progressed, the author sensed a change in the situation, observing that the Qatari team's initial accuracy declined, while the Chinese team gradually maintained a decent shooting percentage from the outside and became more daring in challenging the paint, resulting in accumulating fouls from the opponent.</p> <p>Of course, throughout the game, the Chinese team became more focused and proactive in their positioning and passing, finding breakthroughs and scoring opportunities. In terms of physical stamina, Qatar seemed to have declined, while the Chinese team had to grit their teeth and persevere. In terms of mentality, the Chinese team's strong desire to turn the game around was evident due to their continuous lagging behind.</p> <p>From watching the game on TV to the award ceremony, the author cheered passionately and was deeply moved.</p> <p>As Coach Xu Jinzhe (who served as a commentator for the game) said, the Chinese team chose forwards (around 190 cm) who could shoot from the outside and emphasized players with that ability. Among them, eight players trained together from January to June before the Asian Games, and in the end, four players were selected as the main team. Therefore, Lin Xin-kuan, Jiang Jun, Yu Xiangping, and Wang Zheyu were the four players on the court (of course, credit should also be given to the coaching staff and the training they provided). The other four players should also be commended.</p> <p>A game is like life - nothing is impossible. This game sparked intense discussions among fans online, and most importantly, it showcased our basketball abilities. We were considered the underdog, underestimated domestically and internationally, but we shattered everyone's expectations. If we were to rationally summarize the factors that led to our gold medal victory, it would include the initial selection strategy, the team's chemistry, and the players' mental focus and perseverance.</p> <p>However, what touched me the most about the Chinese team's victory this time is the inspiration it brought to everyone, both on and off the court. It is something that we can never get tired of hearing: \"Even if no one believes in themselves, or if they believe they have reached their limit, they should still stay true to themselves and not set limitations. As long as they step onto the court, there is an opportunity. Give it your all, and don't leave any regrets.\"</p> <p>I believe that in the coming days, there will be more articles written about the legendary Chinese men's basketball team in this 3x3 competition. I would like to express my gratitude to the Chinese men's basketball team. Thank you for showcasing your worth through team basketball, proving Taiwan's capabilities, and bringing us a lot of positive energy.</p>"},{"location":"20231004091442648802/","title":"2023 FIBA World Cup Men's Basketball Schedule, Results, and Broadcast Information","text":"<p>After the qualification stages, the 2023 World Cup will kick off on August 25th    2023 FIBA World Cup Men's Basketball Schedule, Results, and Broadcast Information</p> <p>After the qualification stages, the 2023 World Cup will kick off on August 25th.

The game featured ANGO's innovative \"glow-in-the-dark ball,\" which amazed her and left a deep impression of the ANGO brand.</p> <p>During her time at Videoland Sports, Li Yihan noticed that teams like Taipower and Tatung were wearing ANGO jerseys during the Taiwan Enterprise Football League broadcasts. This sparked her interest in getting to know ANGO better and she discovered that ANGO is not just a sports equipment manufacturer, but also develops high-quality jerseys for both football and basketball, providing athletes with more options.</p> <p>Continuing to read about the encounter between a new generation sports anchor and a new generation sports brand, what kind of new imagination will arise for the sports industry and Taiwan's sports industry? What does the perfect jersey look like in the eyes of a sports anchor? Despite being a new sports brand, ANGO jerseys not only have a refreshing design but also meet the needs of athletes with their moisture-wicking and quick-drying functions.</p> <p>Seeing that Taiwan now has its own high-quality jersey brand, Li Yihan shared her vision of a perfect jersey: \"The first thing you notice is the external design and color coordination. Then comes comfort, it should be able to absorb sweat, especially during intense matches where it's important for the jersey to have quick-drying functionality, so it can dry quickly after washing for the next day's game.\" During the interview, Li Yihan wore an ANGO jersey and praised it, saying, \"I think ANGO has done a great job. Besides looking good and being comfortable to wear, they have also considered many details that girls care about, such as whether the jersey is see-through, if it provides adequate coverage, and whether the sleeveless part exposes the side of the chest.\"</p> <p>Clearly, creating a good jersey is not an easy task. It requires not only maintaining high standards of quality and comfort but also considering the users' needs in the design process, which requires dedication from the brand.</p> <p>Transitioning from the football industry to the basketball industry, ANGO's professional jerseys lead in high-end functionality and performance. Li Yihan, who has long been concerned about the sports industry, has been involved in basketball since high school and even joined her university's basketball team. Her first job after entering the professional world was as a sports journalist, showing her close relationship with sports.</p> <p>Based on her personal experience and from a different perspective, Li Yihan understands the influence of sports brands. \"I know that JHBL (Junior High Basketball League) collaborated with ANGO this year. They sponsored customized jerseys, warm-up outfits, and socks for the players, which I think is great. It not only means recognition for JHBL but also means that more people will see the strength of Taiwan's sports brand, creating a mutual support and mutual benefit.\"</p> <p>Having experienced playing basketball during her student years, Li Yihan can empathize with the importance of sponsorship and encouragement for student teams. Therefore, she highly appreciates ANGO's support for grassroots sports, such as providing sponsored balls and jerseys. While ANGO initially focused on the football market, they have recently expanded into basketball, offering high-quality jerseys to more talented athletes, allowing them to perform at their best. Despite expanding their supply chain, ANGO maintains an environmentally friendly manufacturing process, which impresses Li Yihan and shows their commitment to environmental protection. Just like a perfect jersey should consider not only the athletes but also the entire industry ecosystem and manufacturing environment.</p> <p>If they can maintain an environmentally friendly spirit, it will not only benefit the sports industry but also contribute to the Earth.</p> <p>A jersey represents not only a team but also a spirit. Li Yihan, who has covered numerous sports events, chose to enter this field not only because of her fascination and curiosity about working in television but also because of her passion and love for sports. She has steadily progressed to where she is today, even earning the title of \"cutest anchor,\" which fully reflects her innocence, enthusiasm, and professionalism in her work.</p> <p>Enthusiasm and steadfastness have always been essential to the sports spirit. \"I think work is similar to sports. You have to constantly improve your professionalism and skills.\" Li Yihan has a serious and determined demeanor. Despite being a public figure as an anchor, she is often scrutinized and subjected to online trolls and rumors. However, she is willing to change her mindset and continue to push herself. \"My next goal is to improve my ability to broadcast sports events, especially my favorite basketball events. I also hope to one day step into the Olympic arena and report on Olympic events.\"</p> <p>Li Yihan speaks passionately and confidently about her clear goals, as if preparing to shoot a basket, determined to rise and hit the bullseye.

We hope to have more discussions and share various opinions on watching the game.</p> <p>After the press conference, the 2023 Cross-League Invitational Tournament will once again take place, and this time it will be even bigger than last year. Even the National Chengchi University, which has won three consecutive championships in the University Basketball Association (UBA), will step onto the battlefield to see if the UBA powerhouse \"Political Universe\" can challenge higher levels. This will undoubtedly be a major topic of discussion in the Cross-League Invitational Tournament. As the little brother, NCCU has no burden. No one will blame them for losing to professional teams. If they win, they may face pressure as the big brother. However, the tournament rules prohibit the use of foreign players but allow the registration of foreign students, which is a basic requirement for NCCU. The team's key player, Mobley, who is known as the \"strongest foreign student,\" can participate, which is advantageous for NCCU.</p> <p>But NCCU's challenge to a higher level may not be the biggest topic of this tournament. If we consider Taiwan Beer Leopards and the SBL Taiwan Beer as a joint team, the Taishin Bank Taipei New Warriors of the T1 League can be said to be the most representative team participating in the T1 League. In the previous Cross-League Invitational Tournament, the T1 League outperformed the P. LEAGUE+ and SBL, and the championship game was an all-T1 League battle between the New Taipei Fubon Braves and the Taiwan Beer Bears. However, before the New Warriors took the court, they became the biggest topic, not because of any positive news related to the game.</p> <p>Please continue reading below. Taishin Bank listed \"Lin Binsheng\" on the roster, as previously claimed, allowing Lin Binsheng to represent the New Warriors in the Cross-League Invitational Tournament. Of course, this time there is no Hsinchu Formosa Taishin Bank Braves, which participated in the previous tournament, so the storm has somewhat subsided. However, the combination of Lin Binsheng, Formosa Taishin Bank, and the New Warriors has already become an unavoidable focus in Taiwanese basketball during this offseason.</p> <p>And today, the New Warriors held a press conference to announce the team lineup, cheerleaders, mascot, and two foreign players, as well as the foreign head coach Brian Adams. However, whether it was the news on social media about the press conference or the comments on the live stream of the press conference, they were filled with criticism and ridicule, making it obvious that Taishin Bank did not step onto the stage of the Taiwan Professional Basketball League in a celebratory atmosphere.</p> <p>The controversy surrounding the \"Warriors\" continues below (image source: Taishin Bank Warriors). Taishin Bank Warriors and Lin Binsheng held a press conference on Monday (September 11th), where Lin Binsheng read from a script to express his apologies, recent developments, and his decision-making process. But the biggest problem is that at the end of the \"press conference,\" the host on-site announced that Lin Binsheng and the appointed lawyer would not be available for interviews, and if reporters had any questions, they should \"talk to team leader Shang Ruiqiang.\" However, throughout the press conference, Shang Ruiqiang mainly emphasized the opposition between Taishin Bank and Formosa Taishin Bank Braves and only revealed more about \"the Warriors' offer to Lin Binsheng may not be higher than the Braves, but it provides more security for his overseas career.\" In terms of a press conference, this is undoubtedly a very poor way of handling it. It is obvious that reporters would want to ask the person who signed the contract questions. Of course, Taishin Bank may be concerned about Lin Binsheng's ability to express himself since he is a player, but that is the job of the appointed lawyer. Since in the previous coordination meeting, Lin Binsheng could be represented by the appointed lawyer, it is the basic obligation for both of them (representing the same person) to be available for interviews at the press conference. However, in the end, Lin Binsheng left with a bewildering statement of \"taking the responsibility that should be taken,\" and the appointed lawyer mentioned the already infamous \"legal prosecutorial rights\" on the internet. Then both of them refused to be interviewed, leaving only team leader Shang Ruiqiang. From his conversation with the media, it is clear that Shang Ruiqiang cannot clarify any doubts about Lin Binsheng. In other words, although many details have been revealed since the incident broke out, such as the time of the Braves' contact with Lin Binsheng, the content of the contract, and its validity, the key point lies in the person who signed with both sides. Unless he can confidently and flawlessly present his side of the story, leaving no doubts for any party, a press conference is obviously a place where reporters will want to question the person who signed the contract.

Taishin Bank Warriors' Instagram account was launched after the press conference, and Lin Binsheng, who had been unresponsive since the announcement of his joining the Braves, actively commented on many of Taishin Bank Warriors' posts, especially when introducing teammates. Lin Binsheng almost always commented early with a supportive attitude, showing his recognition and goodwill towards his teammates. However, due to recent inappropriate public appearances or statements, the comments on the Warriors' Instagram were filled with criticisms not only towards Lin Binsheng but also towards the team. Even when Lin Binsheng stopped commenting, the mocking remarks from netizens continued to flood the Warriors' Instagram.</p> <p>Please continue reading below.</p>"},{"location":"20231005091328478275/","title":"The T1 Taichung Sun Protest Alliance is protesting against the decision made by T1 League to cancel Taichung Sun's eligibility to participate in the next season due to failing the financial audit","text":"<p>The T1 Taichung Sun Protest Alliance is protesting against the decision made by T1 League to cancel Taichung Sun's eligibility to participate in the next season due to failing the financial audit.

The team's chemistry, injury issues, and even Wiggins' personal problems, to some extent, affected their cohesion.</p> <p>The Warriors had a tumultuous off-season, starting with trading Jordan Poole, who had been with the team for four years, for Chris Paul, a player in the same position. The next day, they drafted guard Brandin Podziemski from Santa Clara with their first-round pick and also signed Cory Joseph and Dario Saric in free agency. Looking at the roster, it may seem like the team's strength hasn't changed much. However, as long as the three core players perform at their normal levels and maximize Chris Paul's abilities, the team can still remain competitive.</p> <p>The first issue that Steve Kerr should address is how to manage the rotation of the guards. Should CP3 start or come off the bench? If CP3 accepts a bench role, it would undoubtedly be the best approach. If he starts alongside Curry, the defense of the starting backcourt would be a major weakness.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Warriors' frontcourt lacks height, with Kevon Looney, who stands at 206 cm, already not being tall enough. If Green is moved to the small-ball center position, rebounding will be a challenge, and the team will lose its ability to control the paint. Although Kerr has used a \"Death Lineup\" consisting of Curry, Poole, Thompson, Wiggins, and Green in the past playoffs, creating ample spacing, there is a minimal chance of grabbing offensive rebounds when their shooting is off. Additionally, consistently asking players to play smaller roles can also drain their energy. To maximize CP3's value, it is better to have him play with the second unit. Curry and Green both need the ball to initiate the offense, and CP3's ball-handling responsibilities would be significantly reduced. Although his usage rate has been declining, it is not a good idea to have him play as a catch-and-shoot player or to have him play off the ball extensively.</p> <p>In other words, his ball-handling percentage would increase if he played with the second unit. Another issue is CP3's playstyle, which relies heavily on pick-and-roll (P&amp;R) plays. The Warriors' system emphasizes setting screens and off-ball movement, so there might be a need for time to adjust.</p> <p>However, I disagree with this notion. In recent years, Curry and Draymond have also started to utilize more high pick-and-roll plays to create more space for Curry to attack and take pull-up shots. I believe Paul can still play the P&amp;R game with the Warriors, and Kuminga might benefit from it as well.</p> <p>The key factor will be Chris Paul's adaptation speed. Although Chris Paul's effectiveness in pick-and-roll plays has declined, his elite skills in this area can still create good scoring opportunities for himself. Considering the success of Paul and Ayton's pick-and-roll in the Suns, as long as Kuminga improves his screening quality, I have confidence that Kuminga can be properly utilized. Setting aside the perceived waste of Chris Paul's $30 million salary as a bench player, I believe it is not a bad decision. For now, the focus should be on finding ways to help the team and improve the lack of firepower in the second unit.</p> <p>I believe CP3 will understand this. Instead of chasing elusive consecutive starting records, it would be better to increase his chances of winning a championship ring in his career.</p> <p>Last season, the Warriors had Donte DiVincenzo, who had a high conversion rate from beyond the arc, to maintain a decent outside shooting presence. Therefore, I hope Brandin Podziemski, who has been drafted, can step up as a reliable shooter off the bench, with a strong focus on improving his defense.</p> <p>Podziemski displayed exceptional shooting skills from beyond the arc during his sophomore season at Santa Clara, shooting 43.8% and contributing 2.5 three-pointers per game. Although the level of competition in Santa Clara's conference might not be the highest, it is still quite impressive for the team's leading scorer to achieve such a high shooting percentage.</p> <p>What's more important is that his shooting is not limited to catch-and-shoot situations. He has shown the ability to navigate screens and move without the ball, making him a valuable shooter when paired with Green and Looney, who excel at setting screens. In addition, when his shooting is off, Podziemski can use his playmaking abilities to create opportunities for his teammates.</p> <p>I have high hopes that he can provide a boost to the bench scoring, and he should have no problem playing around 6-8 minutes per game. He is fully capable of executing tactics such as Split Action and Flare Screen.</p> <p>GPII's role is also crucial in compensating for the poor defense in the backcourt. The regular-season rotation in the backcourt should look like this: starting lineup - Curry + Thompson, bench - CP3 + Podz + GPII (primarily playing the small forward position but also contributing to backcourt defense). The team has also lost a significant amount of points due to turnovers, with an average of 16.3 turnovers per game, which is the highest in the league. The team has given away too many easy transition opportunities to opponents, making it challenging to prevent fast-break points. The Warriors have essentially gifted their opponents with a considerable amount of points through turnovers, and these two statistics are the main reasons for their turnovers.</p>"},{"location":"20231005091402084758/","title":"The NBA has commented on the theft of artifacts from the British Museum","text":"<p>The NBA has commented on the theft of artifacts from the British Museum.

Despite only playing 55 games due to injuries, James still led the team with an average of 28.9 points. If he had played more games, the 38-year-old James would have ranked 7th on the league's scoring list. On January 31st, James recorded 28 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds, leading the team to victory with an excellent triple-double performance.</p> <p>In NBA history, there are a total of 11 players who have played at least 20 seasons, including James this season and recently retired Heat leader Udonis Haslem, 42. However, only James can perform as well as the young players. According to StatMuse, a US statistical media, James averaged 28.9 points in his 20th season.

Since 2006, the NBA has banned high school graduates from directly joining the league, so James had an advantage by starting a year earlier. According to ESPN, James mentioned in an interview that he owes his ability to play 20 seasons at a high level to his personal trainer, Mike Mancias.</p> <p>James said, \"Without him, it would have been impossible for me to maintain this level of play.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA) from Canada and Luka Doncic from Slovenia, both members of the NBA First Team for the 2022-23 season, showcased their similar skills in footwork, rhythm changes, and deceleration abilities. SGA exhibited agility and versatility, while Doncic demonstrated strength and power that were hard to stop. Canada had the advantage of having Dillon Brooks and Lu Dort, two strong defensive players, as well as Nickeil Alexander-Walker, who was faster but less physical. Brooks and Dort used their robust bodies to harass Doncic throughout the game. The physicality resulted in numerous fouls and technical fouls being called. The statistics showed that Canada committed fewer fouls and had more free-throw attempts, with a difference of 14 free throws in favor of Slovenia. However, those who watched the game could see that Slovenia's players were the ones constantly complaining and gesturing towards the referees, ultimately leading to technical fouls being called against them. In the second quarter, Doncic received his first technical foul, and in the fourth quarter, during a comeback attempt, he protested again and received his second technical foul, resulting in his ejection from the game. Doncic's style of play often involves creating a lot of physical contact, which can be difficult for referees to officiate. However, his tendency to complain and get tangled up with the referees is well-known. In the 2022-23 season, Doncic received 17 technical fouls, ranking third in the NBA. In the 21-22 season, he received 18 technical fouls, ranking second, and in the 20-23 season, he again received 17 technical fouls, also ranking second. This consistent ranking among the top three players in technical fouls shows that it has become a regular occurrence for him. In a previous article, Doncic himself mentioned this, saying, \"Complaining to the referees is one of Doncic's trademarks, and he has accumulated a large number of technical fouls in the NBA.\" FIBA referees have a lower tolerance for such behavior, as seen in a technical foul Doncic received in a previous game against Vida Island in the preliminary round, as well as in his past experiences in the EuroBasket tournament. Unexpectedly, Doncic couldn't control himself in this crucial quarterfinal match, causing Slovenia to lose their ace player during a comeback attempt. The second technical foul was a result of his protest after not getting a foul call on a jump shot, and upon slow-motion review, it appeared that there was indeed room for the call. However, with six and a half minutes remaining in the game and a 15-point deficit, shouldn't he have quickly gotten up and returned to defense? Doncic chose to sit on the ground and complain, ultimately leading to his expulsion from the game. In NBA games, where entertainment value is paramount, referees may show some favoritism towards superstars, especially when it comes to technical fouls that could lead to their ejection, as it can frustrate fans when they can't see their favorite players in action. However, FIBA international competitions prioritize the game itself over ticket sales, so the referees' tolerance for complaints is lower, not higher. In a post-game interview, Doncic addressed the officiating, saying, \"I admit that I haven't always controlled myself well, but a teammate told me that the referees won't blow the whistle just because I keep complaining.\" He expressed his belief that this was unfair. The report did not specify which teammate said this, nor did it mention which referee made such a comment. However, it is evident that Doncic is still upset with the referees. Apart from complaining about the referees, he also praised his opponent, Brooks, showing some sportsmanship. Doncic said, \"Brooks, as always, used a lot of physicality in his defense. He played great! Many people may not like Brooks, but I have a lot of respect for him.\" Returning to the game itself, Slovenia was actually the team with the hot shooting hand. They made 15 three-pointers with a 48% shooting percentage. Despite Doncic's inconsistent shooting, he still had an impressive performance, making 4 out of 6 three-point attempts. The team as a whole scored 89 points, which is considered high. The first half of the game was evenly matched, with both teams tied at 50-50. However, in the second half, Slovenia started to lose their composure and allowed Canada to pull away. Canada had a dangerous shooting lineup, with five active NBA players among their top scorers. RJ Barrett, Brooks, and Dort were the primary targets for their outside shots. However, the poor shooting performance of the latter two, who only made 5 out of 9 three-point attempts, hurt their team. While RJ struggled from beyond the arc, he had an unusual perfect free-throw shooting performance, making all five attempts, and also had a 50% field goal shooting percentage, scoring a tournament-high of 24 points. He also contributed with his excellent athleticism, grabbing the second-highest number of rebounds for the team with nine, helping to protect the paint. Nickeil Alexander-Walker came off the bench and contributed 14 points, providing a boost to the team's firepower with his ability to score from both inside and outside. Kelly Olynyk, the team's center, only scored seven points, but his presence on the court significantly improved ball movement. When Olynyk was on the court, Canada outscored their opponents by 27 points, having the highest +/- value for the team. On the other hand, Doncic's Dallas Mavericks teammate, Dwight Powell, had a relatively quiet game, committing four fouls and not attempting any shots. He fulfilled his role as a hard worker for the team.</p>"},{"location":"20231005091531079775/","title":"The Players' Association declines the invitation to participate in the inter-league invitational tournament","text":"<p>The Players' Association declines the invitation to participate in the inter-league invitational tournament.</p> <p>The 2023 Inter-League Basketball Invitational Tournament, organized by the Chinese Basketball Association (referred to as the CBA), will include the Asian Games Men's Basketball Team.

Both offensive and defensive details are worth reviewing and learning from.</p> <p>Due to injuries in the backcourt this year, Lin Tingqian took on the role of organizing the team under pressure. He self-evaluated his performance yesterday with seven assists as \"unsatisfactory\", saying, \"I didn't do too well in these two games.

Even Nie Ou Ma, a new member of Taiwan Bank, praised that the \"alma mater\" is not what it used to be.</p> <p>Nie Ou Ma, who is 205 cm tall, comes from Senegal, and his first stop in Taiwan was National Chengchi University.

Chen emphasized that today's loss was due to \"losing to themselves.\" Both offense and defense did not meet the standards of their usual training. \"Especially in the third quarter, we allowed three three-pointers, and there were also many mistakes in offense. We couldn't achieve good ball movement and couldn't bring out the intensity. If we don't perform well, the result is not surprising.\" National Chengchi University today relied on new foreign student Popoka as the main force in the paint. Head coach Chen Zi-Wei explained that Mobaye had some family matters and is expected to return to the team on the 19th. This cross-league match is also a good opportunity for the young players to encourage them to show their attitude and style and learn from their senior players in professional teams.</p>"},{"location":"20231007091130100640/","title":"NBA legend Magic Johnson, who has invested in baseball and American football teams after retiring, recently mentioned his interest in becoming a shareholder of an NBA team","text":"<p>NBA legend Magic Johnson, who has invested in baseball and American football teams after retiring, recently mentioned his interest in becoming a shareholder of an NBA team.

Standing at 208 cm tall, he was rated as a five-star high school player during his student years. He received recruitment offers from top NCAA schools, with the University of Kansas being one of them. Billy is known for his impressive athleticism, as well as his excellent shooting from the perimeter. His exceptional ability to penetrate often creates scoring opportunities for his team. Although he did not receive much attention in the 2018 NBA Draft, he later played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the summer league and signed a two-way contract with their G League team, the Canton Charge.

Head coach, Sam Mitchell, stated that all players are in good health and despite being in the same group as the host country, China, their aim is to finish first in the group.</p> <p>The Chinese team was initially placed in Group B along with the host country, Lebanon, and Mongolia for the preliminary round. Finishing first in the group would secure a direct qualification to the quarterfinals, while the second and third teams in the group would face each other for a chance to advance to the quarterfinals. Lebanon recently withdrew and was replaced by Hong Kong, who will be the opponent for the Chinese team's opening match on the 26th. Mitchell mentioned that although the first opponent has changed from Lebanon to Hong Kong, with a completely different playing style, the intensity of the competition is still at the Asian Games level. Therefore, the team needs to approach each game with a normal mindset. Their second match will be against China, and the third against Mongolia, with the goal of advancing as the top team in the group.</p> <p>The main concern for the Chinese team in their quest for first place is the eligibility of naturalized player, Ateno. Mitchell said, \"Currently, we heard that the team management will make the final confirmation at the team leaders' meeting. Yesterday, we inquired with the team headquarters but didn't receive any news. It feels like he can play, but we still need to wait for the team leaders' meeting for confirmation.\"</p> <p>The Chinese team has also made contingency plans in case Ateno is unable to play. In addition to Li Dewei, who usually plays as a center, power forward Zeng Wendong, who usually plays as the number four, will also take on a crucial role. However, currently, Ateno is still part of the team's starting lineup preparation, and it is expected that he will play alongside Lin Tingqian, Liu Zheng, and Zeng Wendong. The small forward position, number three, will be either Li Qiwei or Lu Junxiang, with \"Black Panther\" Abasi playing as the sixth man. Mitchell mentioned that they hope Abasi can play as the best sixth man because he can easily change the course of the game and contribute a lot of scoring power when on the court. Abasi is expected to be in the sixth man position about 90% of the time. The final decision for the starting lineup will be between Li Qiwei and Lu Junxiang, with a slight inclination towards Lu Junxiang because he can share the workload of Lin Tingqian as a guard and alleviate his pressure.</p>"},{"location":"20231007091204087738/","title":"Introduction to the International Team of the Changyao Cup: The Skills Factory in Atlanta, USA","text":"<p>Introduction to the International Team of the Changyao Cup: The Skills Factory in Atlanta, USA.</p> <p>The United States, with its important position in the basketball world, is not only known for the prestigious NBA but also serves as a model for other countries in various aspects such as sports events, team systems, athlete development, sports marketing, and industry development.

LEAGUE+ training team and T1 League \"\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\" (both team names), winning a total of 70 points. These three victories showcased \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78's\" outstanding performance, leading people to say that they initially thought \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" challenging the adult battlefield as a university team was like \"jumping levels to fight monsters.\" However, based on these three games, \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" seems more like that \"monster\" that other participating teams find it difficult to contend with.</p> <p>Let's take a look at the terrifying statistics of \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" in the previous academic year's college basketball league. Among the sixteen teams in the UBA first division, only three teams had an average score exceeding 80: \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78,\" \"\u5065\u884c\" (a team name), and \"\u4e16\u65b0\" (a team name). \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" and \"\u5065\u884c\" both exceeded 90, but \"\u5065\u884c\" had an average score of 90.5 per game, while \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" had a higher average score of 95.1. This means that even in a situation where three teams already have outstanding offensive firepower, \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" can still surpass the other two powerhouses.</p> <p>Furthermore, \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" has an average score below 65, with a score of 61.8. Their team assists are also the highest among all teams with 24, while the second-place \"\u5065\u884c\" only has 18.6. \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" commits an average of 12.4 turnovers per game, being the only team with fewer than 14 turnovers. Although \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" may not excel in offensive rebounds compared to \"\u4e16\u65b0,\" they still lead in team rebounds among all schools. They are not particularly outstanding in three-point shooting percentage (eighth) and free throw shooting percentage (ninth). In short, although \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" may not sweep all the statistics, they are at the forefront or even ahead of other teams in most of the categories in the college league. There is an obvious gap between them and other teams in terms of their strengths in attack, team defense, and ball movement.</p> <p>\"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78's\" head coach, \u9673\u5b50\u5a01, said that they have arranged many games during the offseason, which has been a physical test for the team. However, he hopes that they can reflect on areas they need to improve in different games. For \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78,\" participating in the cross-league tournament was an opportunity to break away from the college-level competition and experience a higher level of competition. They have shown impressive performances so far, proving that they have the ability to face various challenges.</p> <p>The main reasons for their success may be that they approached the cross-league tournament as university students, without any psychological burden. Even if they lose, no one will blame them. Another reason is that this cross-league tournament allows foreign students but does not allow registered foreign players. Therefore, only \"\u81fa\u9280\" registered \u8076\u6b50\u746a, \"\u53f0\u5564\" registered \u84cb\u6bd4, and \"\u67cf\u529b\u529b\" registered \u8607\u683c\u723e. On the other hand, \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" has the advantage in terms of size and strength, boasting the \"strongest foreign students in history,\" \u83ab\u5df4\u8036, who won the MVP in a previous tournament, and the physically dominant \u6ce2\u6ce2\u5361, who may have some room for improvement in technique but is difficult for other local players to contend with. In terms of interior strength, \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" is undoubtedly the strongest team in this tournament.</p> <p>In addition to \"\u81fa\u9280,\" which mostly consists of their main lineup, the other teams either formed a coalition for this tournament or have mostly young players with less than three years of experience. \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" has the advantage of having played together for many years. Therefore, in terms of team integration, \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" is definitely at the forefront of this tournament.</p> <p>In the game against the P. LEAGUE+ training team, in the third quarter, the main point guard of \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78,\" \u6e38\u827e\u5586, made a brilliant behind-the-back pass to his junior, \u9112\u5b50\u7fb2, for a dunk. It was undoubtedly the best play of the tournament so far. In addition to this impressive pass, \u6e38\u827e\u5586's passing vision, organizational skills, overall court progression, and handling of fast breaks have all shown improvement compared to the previous UBA season. He is undoubtedly the most impressive star point guard of the tournament so far. \u5b8b\u6615\u6f94 (another player) has also continued his good performance from previous games, showing aggressive attacking skills. \"\u653f\u6cbb\u5927\u5b78\" has demonstrated outstanding performance in this tournament, receiving strong evaluations, which is reasonable based on their known capabilities.</p> <p>Please continue reading.</p>"},{"location":"20231008091130585779/","title":"Active university basketball player Ai-Zhe You continues to evolve in the new season, with unlimited potential for the future","text":"<p>Active university basketball player Ai-Zhe You continues to evolve in the new season, with unlimited potential for the future.</p> <p>In recent years, Taiwanese basketball has become popular again, and as the golden generation passes the torch, the growth of the new generation of players has become a focus of attention for fans. One of the rising stars in Taiwanese basketball is Ai-Zhe You, who dominated the small giant egg from high school to university. Basketball has been a part of You's life since he was in high school. </p> <p>During that time, he would go to the tribal basketball court with his family, where he not only enjoyed the fun of running, but also the satisfaction of making shots. \"Now I feel that basketball has brought me a lot of rewards. The feeling on the court is that if I do something well, I can achieve a sense of accomplishment from it,\" You said. \"The game is constantly changing, and for every play, I imagine the outcome. If I can deliver the ball to where I want it to go, I feel happy and excited. I think this feeling is really great.\"</p> <p>In junior high school, You joined a basketball team similar to a \"basketball club,\" where he viewed playing basketball as entertainment and didn't feel much pressure. It was only later, through the introduction of relatives, that he came to Nan-King High Commercial School to challenge the top division. \"I felt very comfortable in the environment of Nan-King and with the help of the seniors at the time. I also learned that Nan-King was a school that was good at developing guards, so I wanted to challenge myself by playing basketball here,\" You said. In his sophomore year, he suffered a severe fracture in his foot. \"I felt very down when I got injured. It was the first time I encountered such an injury. I took some time off and discussed it with my family because I didn't perform well in my freshman year and then got injured in my sophomore year. I had some thoughts of giving up.\"</p> <p>But my family kept giving me strength to keep going, and the coaching staff at Nan-King didn't give up on me. Coach Cheng-Ming Lin always put me in a position of trust, and I didn't want to disappoint their expectations. I wanted to prove that even though I didn't perform well in my freshman and sophomore years, I still had the ability to lead the team in my senior year.</p> <p>It wasn't until my senior year that my efforts paid off. \"That year was extraordinary for me. It was a turning point in my life, and it was because of that year that I gained some recognition and many people got to know me. I dedicated everything I learned to the basketball court and let everyone see me. I had a lot of confidence in myself that year and knew that I had the ability to perform well. But I also understood that it was the coaching staff's cultivation that allowed me to have such performance.\"</p> <p>During his university years, You chose to major in Communication Studies at National Chengchi University. \"Senior Yan-Ting also studied at the School of Communication after entering Chengchi University. He shared some of his experiences here with me, and I wanted to emulate him. I found it easier to adapt after I came here. Besides studying in class, I also learned a lot in terms of interpersonal relationships. Under the literary atmosphere of Chengchi University, I gained a lot.\" </p> <p>Many players encounter the issue of \"self-management\" when they transition from high school to university. When asked about the biggest difference between university and high school, You said, \"We don't have a physical education class schedule. In high school, the coach would take care of everything and plan it out for us. But in university, we have a lot of time that we can manage on our own, so we really need to improve our time management.\"</p> <p>You's self-discipline helped him transition to the intensity of the University Basketball Association (UBA). In his freshman year, he won Rookie of the Year, Assists King, and Steals King, and also won the UBA championship. \"That year was the most exhausting year for me in these three years. I don't know if I was adapting to the intensity of UBA at the time, but Coach Zi-Wei always gave me opportunities and believed in me. He allowed me to take on this responsibility as a freshman and gave me good tactical arrangements. I was really happy that year. I won the championship with my seniors, and it made me realize that winning a championship is not easy.\"</p> <p>In his sophomore and junior years, You continued to dominate as the Assists King and Steals King, and also achieved a three-peat. When asked about the difference between these championships, You revealed, \"I feel that these two years were a process. I gradually had to transition from being a younger player to a leader. In my freshman and sophomore years, I just followed the seniors step by step, but in my junior year, when faced with critical moments, I realized that I needed to step up and take responsibility. The two championships in my sophomore and junior years felt similar. They were both milestones.\"</p> <p>However, as a player at National Chengchi University, You had to balance academics and basketball. After training, he had to rush to class and also take care of his appearance. You relied on the Men's Grooming Amino Acid Facial Cleanser from Man Grooming Hall to combat the oiliness on his face after training. When asked about how he maintains a fresh appearance after training, You revealed his secret weapon: \"Normally, I feel that my face is not clean enough after just using regular facial cleanser, but often after washing my face, it feels dry and tight, and then I quickly become oily.\"</p> <p>\"But after using the Men's Grooming Amino Acid Facial Cleanser, I don't feel dry overall. It feels clean and neat, and not slippery after washing. The oiliness also improves.\" You added, \"After training, when I have to go to class or team gatherings, as long as I wash my face, I look clean and not oily.\"</p> <p>Unsatisfied with the current situation, You looks to the future. Although he has already shown comprehensive performance, You believes that he still needs to improve his shooting. \"I haven't shown everyone in the game that 'I have this ability,' but I think I just need to keep practicing, both in training and in games. Of course, I hope to become stronger in this aspect and have the weapons to challenge after turning professional.\"</p> <p>This summer, You has gained recognition through National Chengchi University's performances, including gaining fame in the World University Games across the Taiwan Strait, defeating NCAA Division I teams to win the WUBS championship, and winning the cross-league invitation tournament against professional teams. You credits the team's chemistry for these achievements, especially the amazing behind-the-back pass during the World University Games that went viral online.</p> <p>Talking about the behind-the-back pass during the World University Games, You modestly said, \"At that time, there wasn't much time left, and I realized that I didn't have a chance to attack. After receiving the pass and turning back, I found Cheng-Hsun cutting to the basket, and I thought that even if I made a mistake at that time, it wouldn't matter (laughs). At that time, Chen-Kang (Tsai Chen-Kang) was actually running to the three-point line, but I wasn't looking at him at all. I turned and saw Cheng-Hsun open, and in the end, he received the pass and made a beautiful layup. It was the result of good teamwork.\"</p> <p>During his basketball career, two basketball stars have had a deep impact on You. When asked about his favorite NBA player, You said, \"If I have to say, it would be LeBron James! He was my favorite player when I was young, and he was the first player I watched in the NBA. I was especially impressed by his leadership abilities. Although he is older now, I think he has maintained his leadership style, and I really admire his interpretation of the game and his high basketball IQ.\"</p> <p>As for his idol in Taiwanese basketball, You revealed, \"In Taiwan, it would be Chen Ying-Chun. We both play the same position, and I want to learn from him in terms of his performance on both ends of the court and his ball-handling abilities. His dominance on the court is something that is difficult for me to learn, but I want to strive towards that direction.\"</p> <p>You's outstanding performance has also caught the attention of professional basketball players. In a previous interview with Lin Wei-Han, Lin mentioned that among the new generation of players, he has high expectations for You. In response, You humbly said, \"I have been watching Lin Wei-Han play basketball, and he is a role model for me to learn from. It is really comfortable to watch him play. He controls the pace of the game very well. I am very grateful for his affirmation, and I will work harder to catch up with the footsteps of my seniors!\"</p> <p>Finally, You shared his plans for the future. After graduation, he plans to participate in the draft, but he doesn't limit himself to specific professional leagues such as the CBA, Taiwanese basketball, or the Japanese BLG. He hopes to find a team that suits his development, whether it's in Taiwan or elsewhere. He will continue to work hard and pursue his basketball dreams, thanking the fans for their support.</p>"},{"location":"20231008091238810838/","title":"After being expelled from the game in the fourth quarter, Dillon Brooks wore gloves and waved his fists in the player tunnel to welcome the return of the coaching staff and teammates","text":"<p>After being expelled from the game in the fourth quarter, Dillon Brooks wore gloves and waved his fists in the player tunnel to welcome the return of the coaching staff and teammates.

He averaged 13.4 points and 4.6 rebounds in the U19 World Cup. Currently, he is playing and studying at the NBA Global Academy in Australia. He is a key player that Japan cannot ignore in the future.

In return, they acquire Damian Lillard. It's surprising that Damian Lillard's final destination turned out to be the Bucks. Why didn't I consider the Bucks in my list? It's not only because Holiday is irreplaceable, but also because they didn't have enough draft assets to trade for Lillard. Upgrading the backcourt commander to a Tier-0 guard scorer with just Holiday, a first-round pick, and two pick swap rights is definitely a steal.</p> <p>Although it's not entirely a downside, Holiday focuses too much on defense, resulting in his inconsistent offense in the playoffs. Especially since Giannis expressed the desire for the team to strengthen and Holiday mentioned that he would retire after his contract expires, it's understandable that the Bucks would have their eyes on him.</p> <p>What's even more important is that the Bucks have never had a backcourt scorer who requires so much ball possession since Giannis joined the team. Lopez, Giannis, and Middleton don't need much ball possession, especially with MVP Giannis being able to play off the ball. Although it's not possible for Lillard to play the same way he did with the Trail Blazers, where he had complete control, it should be a role that Lillard can adapt to, being the pick-and-roll ball handler with a reduced self-shot ratio.</p> <p>Do you still need to play every possession like you did with Nurkic as your pick-and-roll partner when you have Giannis? So, here's the question, how will the team compensate for the loss of Grayson Allen and Jrue Holiday's perimeter defense? Honestly, it's not necessary. The Bucks have always had issues with inconsistent offense from their guards. As mentioned earlier, Holiday's problem has been discussed, and Carter, Allen, and Connaughton are all guards who prioritize defense but have inconsistent offense. The Bucks seem to be willing to sacrifice some perimeter defense in exchange for a more stable backcourt initiator.</p> <p>Especially since their defensive advantage has always been in the interior, as long as the guards can provide screens and block the first shot opportunity, allowing Giannis to help defend with his mobility and Lopez to clean up the paint, it will suffice.</p> <p>The Bucks have reduced their opponents' paint field goal percentage by 2.8% this year, thanks to their interior protectors. Although the responsibility of guarding star players has always been given to Holiday, it may be difficult to find someone to take on that role in the future, especially with Middleton getting older and Crowder not being a suitable option. It might really be Lillard or Connaughton, but it must be said that Lillard had a defensive presence at the beginning of the season, and his poor statistics were largely due to the team's overall defensive struggles. However, if they use a 3-2 defensive formation, positioning Lillard as a chaser with low activity, I believe Lillard won't become a black hole within the team.</p> <p>I was initially going to criticize the Bucks' offseason upgrades as being inadequate, but now with Lillard suddenly appearing, it seems like I need to reconsider.</p> <ul> <li>Trail Blazers Part: The Trail Blazers send Damian Lillard, Jusuf Nurkic, Nassir Little, and Keon Johnson. In return, they acquire Jrue Holiday, Deandre Ayton, Toumani Camara, Bucks' 2029 first-round pick, and the 2028 and 2030 pick swap rights.</li> </ul> <p>Let's start with the trade rumors surrounding the Heat, which were the most intense. Faced with Lillard's desire to go to the Heat, the Trail Blazers obviously didn't comply and couldn't find a favorable trade package from the Heat, such as Herro, Lowry, and Robinson in a 3-for-2 deal, along with two first-round picks. It's no wonder the Trail Blazers had no interest in negotiating with the Heat.</p> <p>But sending him to the Bucks also satisfies Giannis, who clearly likes Lillard. After all, during this year's All-Star draft, Giannis skipped Holiday and chose Lillard as his first pick. Now, he's doing the same thing again.</p> <p>I never thought that Lillard, Nurkic, Little, and Keon could bring in so many assets. One first-round pick, two pick swap rights, this year's All-Star Holiday, and the first overall pick center Ayton. It looks quite substantial on paper.</p> <p>Especially with Holiday having only a remaining 1+1 contract and a salary of 36 million that's not too difficult to match, the trade value is still high. The Trail Blazers should act as arms dealers, taking advantage of other teams' desire to strengthen while the Bucks trade for Lillard and acquire more assets.</p> <p>For example, we can sell Lillard to the Bucks and then tell everyone, \"The East is dangerous now, do any of you need Jrue Holiday to guard Lillard?\" and deceive them of their assets. As long as the next team for Holiday can offer an expiring contract and enough first-round picks, I believe the Trail Blazers would consider it.</p> <p>Of course, the combined 90 million contract of Simons, Grant, and Ayton for at least three more years is not something the Trail Blazers would consider swallowing.</p> <p>But if they can acquire young wing potential, I believe the Trail Blazers would still consider it. As for Ayton, sigh. Personally, I'm not a big fan of him, even though his overall potential is undoubtedly higher than the already established Nurkic. But Ayton's excellent interior defense is already the Trail Blazers' best reinforcement.</p> <p>Although they would lose the threat of the pick-and-pop and handoffs, if Billups plans to completely reshape the offensive and defensive system, reduce double-teaming, increase pick-and-roll and low-post frequency, the Henderson-Ayton connection can still be a threat in the future.</p>"},{"location":"20231008091344928415/","title":"PLG Jeremy Lin announces joining New Taipei Kings","text":"<p>Former Kaohsiung Steel player and basketball star Jeremy Lin had an outstanding performance in the previous PLG season    PLG Jeremy Lin announces joining New Taipei Kings</p> <p>Former Kaohsiung Steel player and basketball star Jeremy Lin had an outstanding performance in the previous PLG season.

Led by coach Wu Zhengjie from Jinhua High School, the team hopes to achieve great success and bring glory to their country. Read on for more details.</p> <p>In the previous Asian Games in Jakarta, 3x3 basketball became an official event, and the Chinese men's basketball team formed a lineup consisting of top players from the University Basketball Association (UBA), including Zeng Xiangjun, Zhu Yunhao, Jian Youzhe, and Zhou Weichen, under the coaching of Yang Zheyi, the head coach of the Fu Jen Catholic University men's basketball team.</p> <p>In the first game of the group stage, they faced Mongolia and all four players performed well, both inside and outside the court, securing a victory. However, in the following match against South Korea, despite Zhu Yunhao's four three-pointers, they couldn't overcome their opponent's strong offense and lost by two points. In the last two games against weaker teams Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh, they had an easy time winning with a large point difference, securing two consecutive victories. With a net point difference of 29 points, they closely followed South Korea and advanced to the next stage as the second-placed team in their group.</p> <p>In the semifinals, the teams were matched based on their rankings, and the Chinese team faced the tall and strong Iranian team. Despite the height support from Zeng Xiangjun in the paint, they struggled on the rebounds and found it difficult to extend their lead. In the end, they were eliminated with a one-point loss of 17-18. Three members of the original Asian Games representative team are now developing their careers in the PLG league, while one member is fighting in the SBL league. They have a complete lineup from guards to forwards and centers, with their fierce outside shooting being their biggest weapon.

They are joined by the new addition Wang Zheyu, forming a strong lineup of four versatile players. Under the guidance of coach Wu Zhengjie from Jinhua High School, they aim to showcase the chemistry and teamwork they developed in the Asian Cup and achieve even better results in the Asian Games.</p> <p>In the group stage, they will compete against Hong Kong, Jordan, the Philippines, and Mongolia, aiming to finish in the top two to advance to the next stage.</p> <p>Mongolia is the strongest team in this group, winning the Asian Cup with dominant performances, averaging 20.8 points per game. They are a team that all the others need to be cautious of. Excluding Hong Kong, the strength of the Chinese team, Jordan, and the Philippines is similar. The situation could evolve into a three-way battle, so they need to be careful and not underestimate their opponents. Otherwise, it would be a pity if they were eliminated in the group stage. The team's ability to make an impact is highly regarded. Compared to the previous tournament, where they heavily relied on outside shooting, this time they have added more penetration, bringing more physical contact and easier scoring opportunities from free throws. </p> <p>The Chinese team, which finished ninth in the previous Asian Cup, has a balanced attack between the inside and outside. It proves that they are not limited to a certain scoring method. All four players can shoot from the outside and have physicality to compete. After going through this period of training and development, Lin Xinkuan and Jiang Jun have shown significant improvement, shedding their youthful inexperience. The lineup of four versatile players not only has height but also excels in rebounding, ranking first among all teams with an average of 21.5 rebounds per game. This will be a key factor in competing for a good placement in the Asian Games. Although they may lack agility, their defensive intensity is commendable. As long as they rotate and cover well, their defense will be strong.</p> <p>Jinhua High School has always been a cradle for cultivating basketball talents, and coach Wu Zhengjie is trustworthy. Jiang Jun also comes from this school, and he and Wang Zheyu were high school teammates, so their chemistry is unquestionable.</p> <p>Lin Xinkuan will undoubtedly be the team's leader. After his experience in the Jones Cup, his shooting has become quicker, and he utilizes his body more effectively. He is the key player on offense and can be relied upon for scoring. It's hard to find many players who can stop him before reaching the quarterfinals.</p> <p>Therefore, it is not impossible for them to advance to the medal round, but they need to demonstrate a stronger performance on both offense and defense. Japan and South Korea are traditional powerhouses, and with the rise of Mongolia, West Asia, and other countries, the competition in this year's Asian Games is expected to be even more intense than the previous edition. The schedule for the 3x3 basketball event at the Hangzhou Asian Games is as follows: Group stage from September 25 to September 29, and the knockout stage and medal matches from September 30 to October 1.</p> <p>(Source of the above image: Official website of FIBA)</p> <p>We encourage you to support our newly established Facebook fan page, where we will share more sports-related content and discuss games together.

The Fubon Braves, who will be challenging for their fourth consecutive PLG championship in the upcoming season, played against the powerful Ryukyu Golden Kings in Okinawa, Japan. The match attracted many Japanese fans, and after a fierce battle, both teams ended with a score of 79-79.</p> <p>The Fubon Braves arrived in Okinawa yesterday to participate in two exchange matches against the defending champions, the Ryukyu Golden Kings, to prepare for the new season. However, with Wu Yongsheng and Zeng Xiangjun representing the Chinese national team at the Asian Games, Lin Zhijie, Zhang Zongxian, and Zhou Guiyu did not play. As for the Ryukyu Golden Kings, they also had some key players absent, but both teams still put on an exciting battle. In the first half, the Fubon Braves' foreign player, Johnson, showed off his dunk skills multiple times, and with the help of new foreign player Ishido's three-pointer, they took a 37-31 lead. In the second half, after Chien Tingzhao's three-pointer and an inside basket by Asian import Balfet, the Fubon Braves gained an 11-point lead. However, the Ryukyu Golden Kings immediately launched a comeback and narrowed the gap to only 3 points by the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Ryukyu Golden Kings tied the game with a three-pointer, and both teams engaged in a fierce battle. With 1 minute and 25 seconds left, the Ryukyu Golden Kings' Tanaka Takakazu made a difficult shot to take the lead momentarily, but the Fubon Braves' Sintelic immediately responded with a three-pointer. Balfet was fouled and made successful free throws, giving the Fubon Braves a 1-point lead with 46 seconds remaining.</p> <p>In the final 30.8 seconds, the Ryukyu Golden Kings' Maki Hayato made a three-pointer, but the Fubon Braves' Balfet faked out his opponent and made a game-tying layup.

What's even more impressive is that he achieved this with a shooting percentage of 41.1%, showcasing his quality as a sharpshooter. Keegan benefited from the Kings' fast-paced and space-oriented tactics, as well as the support of Domantas Sabonis and De'Aaron Fox, who had a career-best season, tearing through opposing defenses. This allowed Keegan to enjoy good shot quality.</p> <p>According to BBall-Index, among the 22 players who played over 1,000 minutes and ranked in the top 10% for three-point shooting percentage and made threes, only Joe Harris, Jevon Carter, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Malcolm Brogdon had better three-point shot quality than Keegan. Besides his excellent shooting touch, Keegan also owes his high shooting percentage to the favorable shooting environment provided by the team.</p> <p>Although the Kings made their first playoff appearance in 16 years, they faced the defending champions, the Golden State Warriors, in a highly intense and defensive series. Initially, Keegan had limited contributions, averaging only 3.3 points and 4 rebounds per game in the first three games. However, he proved his worth in the following games, helping the team extend the series to a seventh game.</p> <p>During the regular season, Keegan averaged only 4.6 rebounds per game. But in the next four games, he showcased his rebounding ability, averaging 8 rebounds per game, and improved his scoring, averaging 14.5 points per game. Although the Kings ultimately fell short in the series, Keegan's presence in the later playoff games created high expectations for his performance in the upcoming season.</p> <p>Visible Transformation: Every summer is a turning point for NBA players' growth. Last summer, during his honeymoon, Fox, who had just gotten married, continued to train hard, leading to his breakout season in 22-23. After his rookie season ended, Keegan, who was about to enter his first offseason, didn't take it easy. He joined Fox in voluntary training sessions and even took on the role of a mentor. This raises expectations for Keegan's growth in the offseason under Fox's guidance, similar to what Fox experienced in the previous season.</p> <p>In an interview, Keegan mentioned that he and Fox had engaged in one-on-one matchups multiple times during their training sessions. For Keegan, who rarely displayed his ability to create his own offense during his rookie season, this was a great opportunity to hone his skills. Although Keegan humbly admitted that he hadn't won a single game against Fox in their training sessions, fans witnessed what they wanted to see during the California Classic game hosted by the Kings.</p> <p>Despite his highly efficient performance in perimeter shooting and catch-and-shoot threes last season, all of his 97.6% three-pointers made were assisted. This raised doubts about his ability to create his own offense at the NBA level. While elite spot-up shooters have a place in the modern NBA that emphasizes spacing, developing the ability to create his own offense and generate space will take Keegan's offensive game to the next level. Keegan indeed responded to these expectations during the California Classic. In the first game against the Golden State Warriors, he scored a game-high 29 points. Early in the game, he showcased his ball-handling and coast-to-coast dunking ability, exciting the Kings' fans and surprising his teammates Malik Monk and Davion Mitchell, who knew that he hadn't shown this kind of play throughout the previous year.</p> <p>(Note: All editor names and photo captions have been removed.)</p>"},{"location":"20231009091210465510/","title":"NBA Pelicans' Jose Alvarado's ankle injury is uncertain for training camp","text":"<p>According to reporter Shams Charania, Pelicans' guard Jose Alvarado injured his ankle during training, and it is currently unknown whether he will be able to catch up with the training camp starting at the end of September   NBA Pelicans' Jose Alvarado's ankle injury is uncertain for training camp </p> <p>According to reporter Shams Charania, Pelicans' guard Jose Alvarado injured his ankle during training, and it is currently unknown whether he will be able to catch up with the training camp starting at the end of September.

It not only builds a bridge for communication between current students and alumni but also creates sustainable benefits for the development of sports.\"</p> <p>NTNU men's basketball coach Li Binghong responded, \"Different from playing in the same arena in the league, the home and away system highlights the players' adaptability to different venues, adding more diverse challenges to the games.\" He also jokingly called out to Chen Ziwei, \"When NTNU won three consecutive championships on our home court, the coach of the three-peat has now moved to another school and won another three-peat. I look forward to competing with him in the home and away games and taking back the three-peat from his hands.\" Chen Ziwei believes that the home and away system of the NCAA and the campus sports atmosphere are management models that Taiwan should emulate.</p> <p>\"I am honored to participate in this feast as an outstanding alumnus.

It is an opportunity to find the right chemistry among the players. Mazzulla started with a twin tower lineup, which indeed requires the most synergy. However, I have to complain about our opening introductions, which seem to look the same every year. The creative department needs to step up.</p> <p>Updating today's news, Pritchard has signed a four-year, $30 million contract extension with the team. Although there were rumors about it earlier, it is still somewhat surprising that he chose to extend his contract in this situation. After all, the team already has White and Holiday occupying the position, and it is uncertain if he fits into the team's future plans. Additionally, he has not shown consistent performance that merits trust. However, considering his affordable salary, the team has shown trust in him, which might help him break free from constraints.</p> <p>Please continue reading below. However, unfortunate news has come at the beginning of the season. Jay Scrubb, who had an impressive performance in the summer league and signed a two-way contract with the team, tore his ACL during training. There is no further update at the moment, but it is certain that he will need to rest for a period of time. It's quite a pity.</p> <ul> <li>Game Observation: Starting five - Please continue reading below.</li> </ul> <p>Today, Mazzulla started with the twin towers, pairing them with White in the backcourt. Let's talk about the defense of Horford and Porzingis against Maxey, a speedy guard. They positioned themselves a bit too high in the drop coverage, giving Maxey too much space to penetrate, relying heavily on White for defensive pursuit. In terms of transition defense, sometimes the twin towers expect the guards to help with the initial matchup, but there are often miscommunications that give opponents wide-open opportunities.</p> <p>Although they adopt a conservative defensive stance, there are several possessions where they directly double-team and then recover on defense. Even when playing conservative, Holiday directly helps defend the ball handler from the weak side, allowing Porzingis to match up against the weak side player.</p> <p>On the offensive end, the twin Js are still on vacation, as they have not performed well offensively. It is worth noting that their timing and screening direction with the center are not ideal, causing their offensive movements to be sluggish. Combined with their ice-cold shooting, the overall offense lacks fluidity. The same problem applies to off-ball screens, with multiple players often crowding together, failing to create enough space.</p> <p>Porzingis, on the other hand, has made some good high post plays. His ability to shoot in pick-and-pop and pick-and-roll situations seems comfortable. Holiday, apart from his quick defensive hands, showcased a strong offensive push alongside Brown in the third quarter.</p> <p>However, as expected, in the second quarter, Tatum and Brown took turns attacking from the low post, causing the opponents to hesitate in double-teaming due to the threat of outside shooters. Towards the end of the quarter, there was an attempt to use a small-ball lineup with Porzingis as the lone big man, pairing the twin Js with White and Holiday. This is a lineup that I believe will be used in crucial moments, but there haven't been many attempts to see how well they work together. It will require more time to observe.</p> <ul> <li>Bench Power - Please continue reading below.</li> </ul> <p>Even though everyone believes that the Celtics have lost depth, our bench players should not be underestimated. Pritchard is the key to unlocking our three-point shooting, confidently taking shots even in a fast-paced game. He has also improved his ball-handling and rhythm control, showcasing his ability to change pace effectively. He has the ability to create his own shot, with several instances of isolation plays and step-back threes, reminiscent of his \"Fast PP\" days. In the frontcourt, Brissett and Stevens have influenced the game as expected with their tenacity. Kornet, on the other hand, seems to struggle with the fast pace, often fumbling the ball. Banton's offensive contribution is not something to expect.</p> <ul> <li>Ubuntu\ud83e\udd96</li> </ul>"},{"location":"20231009091656886631/","title":"NBA Tatum's training video attracts former teammate Grant Williams to comment, \"Just add more dunks like this","text":"<p>NBA Tatum's training video attracts former teammate Grant Williams to comment, \"Just add more dunks like this.\" </p> <p>Grant Williams, who was traded from the Celtics to the Mavericks this summer, has maintained a good relationship with his former teammates.

Many of them were participating in the Firefighting Cup for the first time, and this new experience brought a completely different playing style and atmosphere.</p> <p>When asked about the most memorable games in the northern region and national finals, 16-year-old Yu Mengxun said, \"In the preliminary rounds, we knew that winning the game would secure our spot in the top four. However, due to our own mistakes, we lost. But in the finals, we had another chance to face Kaohsiung High School of Science and Technology. We improved on our previous shortcomings, increased our three-point shooting percentage, and most importantly, the coach changed our defensive strategy. It was only after adjusting on both ends of the court that we were able to achieve victory and successfully redeem ourselves.\"</p> <p>However, Zhiping High School faced some challenges when they traveled to the southern region. The players admitted that they were too relaxed in the first two games of the national tournament, making the first win a difficult one. In the second game, they made too many mistakes and couldn't make the necessary adjustments in time, resulting in a loss. From the third game onwards, they gradually improved their previous issues and became more aggressive in defense. In the semifinals, they reached the expected level of performance. Even after the games, they would discuss the problems they encountered and how to make corrections. With everyone providing feedback and making timely adjustments, along with their growing cohesion, they ultimately achieved the championship.</p> <p>In addition, Chen Liyu, who was awarded the Finals MVP, made a lasting impression by contributing offensively during crucial moments of the championship game. Yu Mengxun, who had already won the MVP in the preliminary rounds, also became the assist leader in the finals. Zhang Enqi, on the other hand, became the steals leader, becoming one of the biggest winners in the single school division. The synergy between these three players played a key role in Zhiping High School's championship victory.</p> <p>Coach Huang Defeng, who led the team to victory, was also awarded the Best Coach by the tournament organizers. When talking about this year's journey, Coach Huang said, \"I am grateful to the Firefighting Cup for providing such a great stage for these young players to showcase and prove themselves. We didn't expect to win the championship this year, especially compared to last year when we had better physical conditions and experience. However, the trust, unity, and fighting spirit displayed by the players on and off the court are the most touching and proud aspects for me and Coach Wu Zhengxian.\"</p> <p>Zhiping High School is grateful to the Firefighting Cup for providing this platform for the players to be seen. They would also like to express special thanks to the school's chairman and parents for taking special care of the student-athletes, allowing them to focus on training and pursue their passion without any worries. They hope that the team can achieve a consecutive championship next year.</p>"},{"location":"20231010091139044903/","title":"The coexistence of the 2023 World Cup and the pressure of the World Cup: Steve Kerr's inheritance and reflection","text":"<p>August 24th was a significant day for the head coach of the US team, Steve Kerr   The coexistence of the 2023 World Cup and the pressure of the World Cup: Steve Kerr's inheritance and reflection</p> <p>August 24th was a significant day for the head coach of the US team, Steve Kerr. Because of the jersey number that Kobe Bryant carried during his 20-year NBA career, basketball fans around the world associate this day with Kobe Bryant. This day was also crucial for the US team as they played their first game in the 2023 FIBA World Cup.</p> <p>In the official press conference before the opening game against New Zealand on August 26th, Steve Kerr and Jalen Brunson were interviewed about their first impressions of the Philippines and the challenges they would face.</p> <p>However, August 24th held a personal significance for Kerr. \"August 24th is my mother's birthday, and that's the biggest impression I have of this day,\" he replied with a smile when asked about his memories of Kobe Bryant. He humorously added, \"Happy birthday, Mom, but I'm sure she's not watching.\"</p> <p>Kerr recalled his memories of Kobe, saying, \"I played against him as a player, and after I started coaching in the later stages of Kobe's career, I have had wonderful memories with him. It was a great privilege to be able to compete with one of the greatest players in NBA history. Even today, we still remember Kobe and the significance he had for all of us and the entire league.\"</p> <p>The US team is currently competing in the FIBA World Cup, with their mission being to reclaim the world championship after finishing in seventh place in 2019, which was the second-worst result in US team history.</p> <p>However, after losing to Lithuania in their first game and then losing to Germany in the semifinals, it is confirmed that the US team will not be able to win the gold medal this year. Photo source: Getty Images. Kerr, who took over as the head coach of the US team this year, previously talked about his experience as an assistant coach to Gregg Popovich in 2019 and 2021, and how it influenced him as a first-time head coach of a national team.</p> <p>Kerr praised the team, saying, \"That experience really determined how we selected this team. We wanted players who we believed could come together as a team in a short amount of time. We have a great group of players who are connected to each other and enjoy playing together.\"</p> <p>\"Being an assistant coach to Gregg Popovich in 2019 and 2021 was a really good experience for me because it allowed me to understand how to build a team in a six-week period. It's completely different from the NBA where you can't build continuity and accumulate experiences to build a team. You have to do it like this,\" Kerr snapped his fingers, indicating the need to efficiently complete the task in a short amount of time.</p> <p>Kerr also admitted that his team learned some valuable lessons in the early stages. The US team won all five of their warm-up games against Puerto Rico (117-74), Slovenia (92-62), Spain (98-88), Greece (108-86), and Germany (99-91). \"The most important thing is to familiarize ourselves with FIBA rules and stay united. In this process, we faced strong opponents, and we have confidence, but we also faced some setbacks. Spain and Germany challenged us, and these experiences have helped us because we know how strong these teams are,\" Kerr praised the German and Spanish teams for pushing them to the limit in the warm-up games.</p> <p>For the US team, anything other than a gold medal is considered a failure. However, the US team's point guard, Jalen Brunson, does not shy away from the challenge. \"Personally, I don't believe in 'pressure',\" the New York Knicks star replied when asked about pressure. \"I understand that as long as I give my all in my game, there is no such thing as pressure. There are moments and situations that require facing difficult odds, but my confidence comes from my professional ethics. As long as I continue to work hard and understand that I strive for improvement every day, there is no pressure. I think for the team, in those moments, we heavily rely on each other,\" Brunson analyzed. Kerr, who won the gold medal in the FIBA World Cup in 1986, also talked about the weight of responsibility. Kerr explained, \"Pressure is self-imposed. We all love what we do. I love coaching, and I also love the pressure or what we call competition. Being a competitor also means accepting the possibility of defeat. That's the essence of the game. There are wins and losses.\" He added, \"Effort, approach, and chemistry are key. I love being part of a team. I love what we are doing right now, trying to build something and taking risks. Of course, the beauty of sports is that there is no risk of losing our lives. But we compete, we give our all, we strive for glory, and we know that if we fail, we may face criticism, and we accept that. But our mindset is that this is a very enjoyable thing. We are extremely fortunate to be a part of all this, to compete, and when we look back on all this in our lives, we know that we have given our all. Like I said, we are working hard and we want to win, but whatever happens, happens. That's part of the game.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231010091416681069/","title":"PLG L\u00fc Zonglin reaches early departure agreement with Fubon","text":"<p>Fubon Braves announced today (2nd) that they have reached an agreement with player L\u00fc Zonglin to terminate his contract early    PLG L\u00fc Zonglin reaches early departure agreement with Fubon</p> <p>Fubon Braves announced today (2nd) that they have reached an agreement with player L\u00fc Zonglin to terminate his contract early.

The Milwaukee Bucks acquired Lillard as their new player by giving up Jrue Holiday, Grayson Allen, a 2029 first-round pick, and two additional first-round picks in exchange. The Phoenix Suns also got involved in the trade by sending Deandre Ayton in return for Jusuf Nurkic, Nassir Little, Keon Johnson, and Grayson Allen. The Portland Trail Blazers, the main seller among the three teams, are highly likely to not keep Holiday and will seek another buyer. As for the other two teams, their acquisitions may not be considered significant upgrades. While Holiday may have a gap in offensive skills compared to Lillard, he is a rare point guard in the league with top-notch defensive abilities and is still capable of contributing on offense. Ayton's presence on the court may have been lower due to his draft position and salary, but he is not necessarily worse than the players they received in return. However, this three-way trade is actually a win-win-win situation, as it is not solely about the players' abilities but rather meets the current needs of all three teams.</p> <p>In acquiring Lillard, the Bucks gained a player who can provide stability and contribute to their postseason aspirations for the next four years. Before discussing the Bucks' situation, it is important to emphasize a trend that has emerged under the new collective bargaining agreement: the number of star players entering the free agency market is decreasing, to the point where it is almost non-existent. This trend was established after 2019, and the new CBA has only furthered this trend.</p> <p>Since Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, and D\u2019Angelo Russell in 2019, only two non-minimum contract free agents, Gordon Hayward in 2020 and DeMar DeRozan in 2021, have changed teams in free agency among players who have previously been All-Stars. Other star players have either re-signed with their current teams through early extensions, re-signed as free agents, or been traded before their previous contracts expired. The main reason for this phenomenon is that there are fewer teams capable of creating significant salary cap space to sign players, and even if there are, they are usually not competitive teams. With the new CBA introducing the hard cap line, teams will find it even more difficult to create enough salary cap space. Therefore, star players who have friction with their current teams or are uncertain about their next contract tend to request trades in order to join a team that needs them more and secure a new contract without salary cap restrictions.</p> <p>But what happens to star players who cannot reach an agreement with their current teams and do not have a desired destination? We have seen two cases this summer: James Harden forcing a trade after exercising a low-priced player option with the Brooklyn Nets and D\u2019Angelo Russell accepting a low-priced contract from the Los Angeles Lakers before waiting for a subsequent trade opportunity. In simple terms, if a star player cannot stay with a team that truly needs them and cannot be traded before their contract expires, they only have the option of taking a pay cut.</p> <p>Holiday has his own issues, as he has never performed well in the postseason throughout his career except for the 2017-18 season with the New Orleans Pelicans. During his three years with the Bucks in the playoffs, he has averaged 17.9 points, a 3-point percentage of only 0.304, and an eFG% of 0.453. Moreover, he takes about 3.5 more shots per game in the playoffs compared to the regular season. Considering his salary and regular-season performance, it can be said that his playoff performance has been severely underwhelming.</p> <p>Both Holiday and Lillard are 33 years old, with their birthdays only a month apart. In terms of health, Lillard may appear to be in worse condition, but that is mainly due to his early career workload. Aside from the 2021-22 season when Lillard suffered a more serious injury, the two players are relatively comparable.</p> <p>Lillard's playoff performance is slightly inferior to his regular-season performance, but not to the extent seen with Holiday. Lillard has also had multiple instances of heroics in clutch moments, which adds an important weapon for the Bucks in the postseason. However, apart from the difference in their playoff performances, another key aspect of this trade is the contract situation.</p> <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo will turn 29 in the upcoming season, and he has two years remaining on his guaranteed contract, with a player option in 2025-26. Given his importance and symbolic significance to the Bucks, it is almost certain that he will sign a max contract extension ahead of his next contract. The Bucks will only consider the need for a change in direction after his next contract expires. However, his current primary supporting cast consists of Brook Lopez (35 years old), Holiday (33 years old), and Kris Middleton (32 years old). Their best-case scenario is to support Giannis for the next 2-3 years, until his current contract ends. After that, they will inevitably face a wave of changes in the supporting cast. With Lillard's contract extending until 2027, the Bucks can stagger the timeline for rebuilding their supporting cast. They won't have to find replacements for three positions within one or two years or endure a sudden decline. Of course, Lillard will also experience decline, but the Bucks can seek opportunities to strengthen the team from other positions.</p>"},{"location":"20231010091514418799/","title":"Appreciation and Reflection on the Efforts of the Chinese Men's Basketball Team at the Unfavorable Hangzhou Asian Games","text":"<p>The journey of the Chinese Men's Basketball Team at the Hangzhou Asian Games, as seen in \"Hangzhou Asian Games-22\", might not have been expected to reach the final day after the group stage performance    Appreciation and Reflection on the Efforts of the Chinese Men's Basketball Team at the Unfavorable Hangzhou Asian Games</p> <p>The journey of the Chinese Men's Basketball Team at the Hangzhou Asian Games, as seen in \"Hangzhou Asian Games-22\", might not have been expected to reach the final day after the group stage performance. However, with changes in the lineup, mindset adjustments, and proactive actions, the path to the podium gradually emerged.</p> <p>Although they fell short of the gold medal match, they were able to compete for the bronze medal against China. In the first half, both teams had their ups and downs, but a turning point emerged in the third quarter when Zhao Rui and Zhao Jiwei teamed up to push the tempo and use high-pressure defense to suppress the Chinese team's offense. In the end, they won the bronze medal with a 28-point difference, leaving us with regrets. Please continue reading \u25bc</p> <p>Lin Tingqian fought hard in the first half, but the imbalance in offense and defense in the second half led to defeat.</p> <p>Detailed game report: In the bronze medal match of the Hangzhou Asian Games, China used the same starting lineup as their first encounter against the Chinese team's newly formed lineup. In the first quarter, both teams had multiple players contributing to the score, with no focus on a single player. The score kept rising, and the lead changed hands several times. However, Lin Tingqian emerged at the end of the quarter, scoring 7 points on his own to give his team an 8-point lead.</p> <p>In the second quarter, the Chinese team managed to maintain their lead in the first five minutes. However, Zhao Rui and Cui Yongxi managed to tie the score, and with the help of Zhao Jiwei's two consecutive three-pointers, they regained the lead. The following exchanges of blows occurred, and with Liu Zheng's three-pointers, the Chinese team entered halftime with a 3-point lead. </p> <p>The second half witnessed a change in the game. China, abandoning the inside presence, played with a fast-paced offensive rhythm. Zhao Rui and Zhao Jiwei connected with Hu Jinqiu to form a strong trio, frequently tearing apart the Chinese team's defense from both inside and outside. They regained the lead and quickly extended the lead. The high-pressure defense forced the Chinese team to rely on outside shooting, making inaccurate shot choices. They only scored 10 points on 17 attempts in the quarter, causing a sudden shift in momentum. In the final quarter, China stabilized the situation with Zhang Zhenlin. Although the Chinese team managed to score, it was not enough to catch up with the opponent's momentum. The game ended with substitutions on both sides, and China ultimately won the bronze medal with a score of 101:73. The Chinese team finished the tournament in fourth place for the second consecutive time.</p> <p>Please continue reading: In this game, no player from the Chinese team had a positive plus/minus value. Lin Tingqian scored 20 points, the highest on the team, while Liu Zheng, Ater Majok, and Abass had double-digit scores. With a poor shooting percentage and losing the rebound battle by 13, it was difficult for the team to achieve victory.</p> <p>In contrast, China performed excellently in the fast-paced third quarter, with five players scoring in double digits. Cui Yongxi scored 20 points, Zhao Jiwei contributed 12 points and 8 assists, and Zhao Rui added 17 points and 5 assists. With the support of 13 three-pointers, their focus and execution in the second half were impeccable, leaving no room for doubt about winning the bronze medal.</p> <p>\u25bc Despite being underestimated, they fought hard until the end. Despite the disadvantage in the lineup, the Chinese men's basketball team finished the Hangzhou Asian Games tournament yesterday. The Philippines advanced to the gold medal match by reversing the game against China and defeating the towers of Jordan and their main scorer, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, to win the Asian Games gold medal after a 61-year gap. Jordan achieved their best-ever silver medal result after strengthening their team with naturalized players in recent years. China won the bronze medal, while the Chinese team finished in fourth place. It is not easy to maintain form throughout the tournament and achieve good results. Jordan was expected to win the gold undefeated, but they were ultimately defeated by the Philippines, who easily defeated them in the group stage. The Chinese team fought hard but fell short against China, who only lost to the Philippines. The Philippines, on the other hand, produced a great surprise, overcoming two difficult challenges to claim victory, making this tournament full of surprises and unpredictable outcomes. Please continue reading: When it comes to the bronze medal match, we have to look at the third quarter when China replaced Wang Zhelin with Hu Jinqiu. Hu's quick and decisive offensive moves and unclear defensive assignments in one-on-one situations tore apart the defense in the paint, leading to China's success. With the inside presence established, there was more space for outside shooting, and their three-pointers hitting the mark repeatedly dealt a heavy blow to us. </p> <p>The Chinese team's struggle can be attributed not only to the loss of defensive rhythm but also, in the author's opinion, to several unfavorable calls that had an impact. There were many instances of minor actions by the Chinese team, such as pulling shirts and pushing opponents, which resulted in disadvantages for us. The offense lacked effective strategies and often resorted to hasty shots from the perimeter, which allowed China to tighten their defense. It was difficult for Ater Majok and Zeng Wen to score in the low post, and the score stagnated, making a comeback in the final quarter challenging.</p> <p>Although they ultimately failed to win a medal, the Chinese men's basketball team deserves appreciation for their performance throughout the tournament. From overcoming the lack of a point guard to facing challenges in the group stage, successfully dealing with Japan's fast-paced style of play, losing to Jordan's three towers, and finally finishing fourth after two defeats against China, their efforts are commendable. Of course, they have received criticism, and after the group stage, most people did not have high expectations for their progress, believing that losing to Japan would be the end. However, in the end, it is the game that determines the outcome. Even with an imperfect lineup, their full determination and efforts are still worthy of pride. \u25bc With a few surprises, a strong starting lineup can cultivate reliable reinforcements.

With changes in game rules, the league's ecosystem and operations have undergone significant developments. Who benefited and who suffered from the new CBA? The end of the superteam era? As mentioned in my previous article at the end of June, with the implementation of the second apron (Super Tax), many powerhouse teams are unable to avoid salary cleansing, such as the Warriors trading Jordan Poole, the Clippers letting go of Eric Gordon, and the Hawks selling John Collins.</p> <p>However, the Suns have shown a completely opposite approach, trading Wizards' star Bradley Beal before the new CBA took effect to maximize their cap space. This may be the last super team in the NBA for the foreseeable future. Under the new CBA, once a team's total salary exceeds the second apron, they cannot use the middle-class exception or sign-and-trade, and the flexibility of trade amounts will be limited. The future first-round draft picks will directly become the 30th pick, making the cost much heavier than luxury tax. It will be challenging to maintain a roster with three superstars (salary accounting for over 30%) in the long term. For example, the Suns' Kevin Durant and Beal will account for approximately 35% of the salary cap in the upcoming season, while Devin Booker will account for 26%. However, starting in the 2024-25 season, when the new contracts take effect, the three Suns stars will consume about 105% of the salary cap, which is an overflow situation.</p> <p>Simply from a salary perspective, Deandre Ayton will likely become a contract that needs to be traded. I believe that the Suns cannot sustain a big three lineup for too long; they will have to show their true colors in the short term.</p> <p>The next team facing salary crisis is the Timberwolves. They signed Anthony Edwards to a five-year, $259 million extension this summer, effective from the 2024-25 season. Combined with Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert's contracts, they will consume 90% of the salary cap. Unless the Timberwolves can quickly grow into a championship-contending team in the short term, they will face the consequences of the second apron.</p> <p>The Clippers, whose salary has already exploded, need to make choices in the new season, accelerating the replacement of high-priced veteran players like Paul George and Kawhi Leonard to alleviate salary pressure.</p> <p>This year and the next will be a transitional period, and powerhouse teams will need to slow down and adjust their rosters instead of relying on silver bullet strategies to strengthen their teams.</p> <p>Teams like the Suns, Timberwolves, Warriors, or Clippers may find more suitable role players through trades, but it will be challenging to maintain the current salary cap for a long time. They will either have to trade high-salary players or face rebuilding. However, don't worry, I believe the resilient NBA executives will still be able to form super teams. However, if they fail to win championships, the consequences may be more painful than before.</p> <p>The more flexible trading and signing exceptions of the new CBA will benefit teams with limited financial resources. Many trading restrictions have been relaxed, and more exceptions can be used as long as the total salary remains below the two aprons. The Cavaliers, for example, saved up to $7.5 million in price difference by completing a sign-and-trade for Max Strus (4 years, $63 million). Under the old rules, the Cavaliers would have had to offer a higher-priced contract to the Heat. The Rockets also benefited from this new rule when signing Dillon Brooks.</p> <p>Second-round rookies now have their own special exceptions. Unlike first-round rookies with standardized contracts, second-round rookies used to have to use salary cap space or split middle-class exceptions to sign 3-4 year contracts. The new second-round exception solves this problem. The Kings used this exception to sign Colby Jones, the 34th pick, to a 4-year, $8.76 million contract, while the Hawks signed Mouhamed Gueye, the 39th pick, to a 4-year, $7.63 million contract with a team option in the final year. This is seen as a key move to avoid a repeat of the \"Jalen Brunson situation,\" where teams had limited options when restricted free agents received offers.</p> <p>In 2021, the Nuggets signed Michael Porter Jr. to a designated rookie extension of 5 years, $179.29 million, which caused some discussions. Previously, teams were limited to two designated players. With the new CBA, this limitation has been removed, and first-round rookies can sign 5-year contracts without any conditions. This allowed Desmond Bane of the Grizzlies to sign a 5-year, $197.23 million contract, slightly below the max contract of 25%. This shows that the NBA is encouraging the development of young players and giving more incentives and conditions for teams to keep their young players. Restricted free agents have a disadvantage in negotiating contracts. While they have the advantage of being able to match any offer from other teams, it weakens their bargaining power. The offering team usually needs to offer a slightly higher contract to discourage other teams from pursuing the player. This limits the restricted free agents' ability to secure the ideal contract value.</p> <p>In terms of free agency, excluding re-signings, only four players, Max Strus, Bruce Brown Jr., Fred VanVleet, and Dillon Brooks, received new contracts exceeding the full mid-level exception. Among the 7-10 teams that can create tens of millions in cap space, only the Pacers and Rockets are willing to spend money.</p> <p>Rather than focusing on large-scale experiments with cap space as in the past, many rebuilding teams have reaped rewards in this offseason, providing better development opportunities for young players and making the games more competitive.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the new CBA requires teams to meet the salary floor threshold on the first day of the season; otherwise, they will not be eligible for luxury tax distribution. This has put pressure on teams to spend money in the offseason. While teams like the Pacers and Rockets have offered premium contracts, many rebuilding teams have filled their cap space through trades and invested in functional veteran players.</p> <p>Unlike in the past, where teams preferred to keep cap space for big moves, many rebuilding teams have reaped benefits this year, giving young players more room to develop and making the games more exciting.</p>"},{"location":"20231010091650559006/","title":"During the NBA offseason, Jayson Tatum considered having surgery on his left wrist but ultimately decided against it after evaluation","text":"<p>During the NBA offseason, Jayson Tatum considered having surgery on his left wrist but ultimately decided against it after evaluation.</p> <p>Many NBA players accumulate injuries throughout their careers, and some choose not to address them.

After fighting their way through the chaotic qualification rounds, they emerged from the \"Group of Death\" consisting of Preseason, Nengren Commercial High School, Songshan High School, and Keelung Business and Vocational School. They even defeated the championship favorites, Songshan High School, and staged a comeback against Keelung Business and Vocational School after falling behind in a significant margin to secure their spot in the playoffs. Please continue reading.</p> <p>In the first life-or-death match of the wildcard game in the playoffs, Cureping High School and Chenggong High School fought fiercely until the end of the fourth quarter. A five-second violation during a serve caused Cureping to lose their last chance to score, leading the game to go into overtime. However, in a situation where Cureping was trailing by three points at the final moment, they committed another serve violation, allowing the opponent to score two points and resulting in their defeat.</p> <p>The Cureping roster for the 111th season consisted of many talented players. The senior trio, Dai Yi, Yang Haoxiang, and Hong Huaien, formed a top-notch backcourt lineup. Lu Qinghong and Huang Yanlun were reliable forwards with solid playing styles. Second-year players Zheng Xufu, Huang Shengen, and Chen Guanlun also made timely contributions. Cureping also welcomed former Xinrong High School coach Su Yusheng to the coaching staff last year, bringing a qualitative change to the team's defense. Together with coach Wu Jianlong, who inherited the Nengren system's offensive system, they established a team style that excelled in both offense and defense. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Overall, Cureping had a relatively well-rounded main lineup last year, despite being slightly lacking in height. Coach Su Yusheng admitted that the heartbreaking ending last year was not the players' fault. \"The problem last year was still with the coaching staff! We didn't explain clearly during the timeout. We have to take the greatest responsibility.\"</p> <p>After the end of the 111th season, Cureping bid farewell to five key players, including two main attackers, Dai Yi and Yang Haoxiang, leaving a significant void in the team's offense. Both Wu Jianlong and Su Yusheng believe that this year, with a lack of players who can take charge of the attack, Cureping must strive towards the goal of \"everyone is a soldier.\"</p> <p>Wu Jianlong said, \"I emphasized to them this year that even though we had excellent attackers like Haoxiang and Dai Yi last year, we still couldn't make it to the top eight. It just shows that basketball still relies on all five players. Even if I don't score, as long as I can defend the opponent and contribute to the team, it will bring positive energy to the team.\"</p> <p>Su Yusheng believes that the team's defensive intensity will be the key to how far Cureping, with a height of only 190cm, can go this year. They must put more pressure on opponents and create more exhaustion from the frontcourt to have a chance to compete with the strong teams.</p> <p>Since the summer tournaments, Cureping has continued to demonstrate impressive competitiveness. However, the coaching staff has noticed that the team occasionally experiences power outages. For Cureping, who is about to participate in the qualification rounds, improving stability will be an important task to adjust before the start of the HBL season. Coach Su Yusheng admits that, after all, this is a student basketball game, and fluctuations are sometimes unavoidable. However, if such uncontrollable turbulence occurs during critical moments, it will severely impact the overall condition of the team. Wu Jianlong also said, \"Our stability is really not enough now. After all, we are a team that will participate in the qualification rounds, and our condition cannot be fluctuating.\" \"Sometimes when our team cooperates well, we can win by 20 points, but if we suddenly rely on individuals, that rhythm disappears. We don't have any outstanding individuals this year, so we can only rely on the team. Therefore, we must establish a sense of teamwork, and several players must step up for a chance to compete with strong teams.\" Despite having competitive strength every year, Cureping always falls short at critical moments. Wu Jianlong jokingly said that this year, they won't be thinking about \"reaching the top eight\" like last year but instead focus on taking each step steadily and firmly. Perhaps this approach can reduce the players' pressure and even bring unexpected surprises. \"After all, the process and determination are the most important, rather than whether we make it to the top eight or not.\" Follow the Sports Vision for more in-depth sports reports.

Perhaps the James Harden trade will eventually go through, or maybe there will be a player who becomes available and sparks the interest of the 76ers.</p> <p>Please continue reading about Kelly Oubre Jr., the veteran wing player who signed with Philadelphia this summer. While some 76ers fans may have doubts or reservations about him, signing Oubre Jr. to a veteran minimum contract is a great addition to the team's wing rotation.</p> <p>In fact, the 76ers' roster is already filled with talented players. They have the reigning MVP Joel Embiid and one of the most charismatic young stars in the NBA, Tyrese Maxey. De'Anthony Melton is returning after an impressive first season with the 76ers, Paul Reed is back with a new contract and the opportunity for a new role under Nick Nurse. However, there are still many question marks on the roster. Tobias Harris and P.J. Tucker are the starting forwards for the upcoming season, and there is fierce competition among Oubre Jr., Danuel House Jr., Furkan Korkmaz, and Danny Green for the backup wing positions. Please continue reading.</p> <p>Among this group, Oubre is clearly the most talented, both in terms of age and NBA experience.</p> <p>Let's address his biggest weakness first\u2014efficiency. Throughout his NBA career, his true shooting percentage has fluctuated greatly. If we want to find a reason to be optimistic, it's that his true shooting percentage has improved every year, reaching 53.4% last season. However, he does tend to commit turnovers at a slightly higher rate than assists, with an average of 1.1 turnovers compared to 1.0 assists per game. In other words, if Oubre gets the ball, there's a chance it might not stay with him.</p> <p>But that's not necessarily a bad thing. For those tired of seeing Harris or Tucker hesitate to take open shots, having Oubre on the team eliminates that concern.</p> <p>Having a scoring wing player off the bench who can create his own opportunities to relieve Embiid or Maxey is a good thing. Despite not living up to the high expectations as a lottery pick, Oubre still possesses qualities that make him an intriguing wing player. Standing at 6'6\" with an impressive wingspan of 7'2\", combined with his athleticism, he remains an attractive option.</p> <p>Furthermore, Oubre has defensive potential, although effort can sometimes be an issue. It's worth noting that Oubre is 27 years old and just coming off a season where he averaged over 20 points per game. The best he could get was a veteran minimum contract with the 76ers, which is undoubtedly a crossroads in his career. He's now on a path that many players have walked before, where they have the ability but struggle to find a place on a championship-contending team.</p> <p>When you have the ability but find yourself bouncing around the league without being able to contribute to a strong championship-caliber team, the best bet is to prove yourself and hope for a bigger contract in the future. Bobby Portis is perhaps the most successful example of executing this strategy. Portis was drafted in the first round by the Bulls in 2015 and had obvious skills.</p> <p>Although Portis had some success, he wasn't a highly sought-after player while playing for the Wizards and Knicks. Therefore, it was somewhat surprising when he signed with the Bucks in 2020. However, Portis proved to be an important player off the bench for the Bucks and became one of the key contributors to their championship season.</p> <p>Portis eventually signed a 4-year, $48.5 million contract with the Bucks, which is a clear case of a successful turnaround and shows that stories of players bouncing back from the bottom are not without precedent.</p> <p>Oubre and his agent, Torrel Harris, are well aware that the 76ers will have enough salary cap space next season and the team will have Oubre's Bird rights, giving them an excellent opportunity to re-sign him if things go well.</p> <p>In conclusion, signing talented players like Oubre, who are in their prime and signed for a veteran minimum contract just weeks before training camp, is undoubtedly a good move for the Philadelphia 76ers.</p> <p>There is essentially no risk involved, similar to signing Patrick Beverley, Mo Bamba, and Danny Green. If Oubre or any of them underperform, they can simply be benched and let go during the offseason (or even earlier). As the opening game approaches, the situation with Harden looms like a disaster, casting a shadow over everything the 76ers do. However, signing players like Oubre is a wise move from a basketball perspective, with almost no downside. [Translated and edited for clarity.

From Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams, Rajon Rondo, Reggie Jackson, to John Wall, most fans did not expect Russell Westbrook to be the final option.</p> <p>After all, when it comes to playing style, he has never been considered in the discussion for the Clippers, and he is not as suitable as Malcolm Brogdon, who was unsuccessful in the summer trade, or James Harden, who has been rumored.</p> <p>Continue reading In February of this year, the Clippers unexpectedly became the best team for Russell Westbrook. This is the only place where he can reclaim his star status, and now, the Clippers will be a team that relies on Russell Westbrook.</p> <p>When Westbrook compromised and became a backup for the Lakers last season, and was subsequently bought out by the Jazz, it was widely believed that \"Westbrook will no longer be Westbrook,\" and his career as a star may have come to an end. There would not be a team willing to let him lead, and most people were not optimistic about whether Westbrook, who has been a one-man team with little playoff experience, could successfully transition. However, the Clippers emerged and provided an environment that allows him to continue his career as a star. Head coach Ty Lue does not want a restrained and polite Westbrook; he just wants Westbrook to continue being Westbrook.</p> <p>Going back to February of this year, there were disagreements between the Clippers' management, coach, and players regarding the signing of Westbrook.</p> <p>Coach Lue repeatedly mentioned that he is a believer in traditional point guard play and wants to have a guard on the court to facilitate the team's tactics. General manager Lawrence Frank always talked about the \"positionless basketball\" philosophy that has been discussed for four years, emphasizing the importance of functional complementarity over traditional point guard play.</p> <p>This philosophy was reflected in their trades. Before the trade deadline last season, the Clippers gave up underperforming players Wall and Jackson but did not acquire any point guards in return. Instead, they forced Lue to make Terance Mann the point guard. Initially, the Clippers showed no interest when Westbrook started discussing a buyout with the Jazz. It was rumored that it was because star player George spoke up and received support from Kawhi, which made the signing possible.</p> <p>Continue reading Compared to the Lakers, the Clippers, who are also located in Los Angeles, can be considered Westbrook's comfort zone. He immediately secured a starting position after the trade, has a head coach who relies on guards, good friends and former teammates in George, and can maintain his aggressive playing style. The Clippers significantly increased their pace after Westbrook joined. Their offensive pace, which was ranked 24th in the league with a PACE of 98.24 before the All-Star break, rose to 100.55, ranking 13th in the league. This allows Westbrook to fully utilize his athleticism.</p> <p>Ironically, Kawhi and George's load management and their early season-ending injuries gave Westbrook a lot of ball handling responsibilities and room to shine. He shattered people's doubts and proved once again that he still has star value. In a regular-season game against the Grizzlies on March 30, when Kawhi and George were absent due to load management, Westbrook had a standout performance with 36 points, 10 assists, and 4 rebounds. In the last three minutes of the first quarter, Westbrook drove to the basket and shouted \"And 1\" after drawing a foul, a moment that was selected as the fans' favorite highlight of the year, fully showcasing his competitiveness and passion.</p> <p>In Game 1 of the playoffs against the Suns, despite a poor shooting performance of 3 for 19, Westbrook played a crucial role on defense. He defended against Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Chris Paul 59 times, allowing only 6 points and even blocking Booker in a key moment, securing the Clippers' only playoff victory of the season. With Kawhi sidelined due to injury, Westbrook had impressive performances in Game 3 and Game 4, scoring 30 points with 12 assists and 8 rebounds, and 37 points with 6 assists and 4 rebounds respectively. He became the sixth player in Clippers history to score over 30 points in consecutive playoff games. Throughout the series, he averaged 23.6 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists, displaying his star-level performance. Continue reading Not only does Westbrook have star-worthy statistics, but he is also the spiritual leader following Patrick Beverley. Lue once mentioned, \"The players were not emotionally down (when Kawhi got injured in the playoffs). Everything changed because Westbrook was in the locker room. Whether I'm on the court with him or he's playing with Michael Jordan, he plays the same way. He makes everyone in the locker room believe that we can win the game.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231011091227539420/","title":"Dreamer Chairman Zhang Chengzhong appointed as Deputy Secretary-General of the Basketball Association","text":"<p>Dreamer    Dreamer Chairman Zhang Chengzhong appointed as Deputy Secretary-General of the Basketball Association</p> <p>Dreamer.

The representatives of the PLG Lions team added a note in the contract, specifically in Article 3, Clause 5, stating that \"if the original team matches the offer within one month after the signing of this contract, the contract will not be effective.\" This clause was intended to protect the original team's priority matching rights. Under the free competition in the two leagues, there was no malicious poaching by the PLG Lions. Furthermore, the original team did not issue any statement accusing the PLG Lions of malicious poaching. It is believed that the fans and the Taiwanese society can judge the situation for themselves.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lin Ping-Sheng's signing was completely voluntary. When Lin Ping-Sheng personally signed the contract, he was accompanied by friends and family at the Starbucks in Beitou. There were also many customers and staff present at the scene. How can an adult, signing a contract in broad daylight with the company of friends and family, not take responsibility for his own signature? Furthermore, the claim made by Head Coach Shang Jui-Chiang at the press conference about coercion to sign is unfounded.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lin Ping-Sheng continued to negotiate contract details with the PLG Lions after June 28th. Lin Ping-Sheng falsely claimed at the Taishin Bank press conference that he had expressed his decision not to join the PLG Lions to the team representatives from June 28th to August 14th. However, in reality, he continued to privately negotiate with the PLG Lions representatives between August 8th and August 14th regarding \"CBA overseas clause, personal incentive bonuses, Hsinchu rental subsidies, training expense subsidies, jersey numbers,\" and other matters. The screenshots released can clearly refute the lies of the Taishin Bank press conference.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taishin Bank team does not respect the consensus reached in the coordination meeting of the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association. The Chinese Taipei Basketball Association issued a statement after the mediation meeting on September 4th: \"Although there is no conclusion reached in this mediation meeting, we hope to propose negotiation conditions on the premise of mutual benefit. After the representatives of both sides report the content of the mediation meeting to the headquarters, a decision will be made on whether to hold a second mediation meeting based on the subsequent situation.\" On September 5th, the PLG Lions received a reply from the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association, in which the Taishin Bank team only agreed to negotiate with Lin Ping-Sheng. This response goes against the consensus of the mediation meeting between the two teams. Finally, the Hsinchu PLG Lions emphasize once again, since legal action has already been taken, has Lin Ping-Sheng breached the contract? Has Taishin Bank engaged in malicious poaching? Let the court, Fair Trade Commission, and all fans in Taiwan be the judge! If Taishin Bank continues to distort the truth and openly lie, the PLG Lions will continue to provide evidence, and we will employ more means to defend the rights of the PLG Lions fans and team.

The Suns also got involved in the trade, sending Deandre Ayton in exchange for Jusuf Nurkic, Nassir Little, Keon Johnson, and Grayson Allen.</p> <p>The main selling point for the Blazers, who were the primary sellers in this trade, is that they are unlikely to keep Jrue Holiday and will seek another buyer. However, for the other two teams, it may not necessarily be a significant improvement. While Holiday may have a gap in offensive skills compared to Lillard, he is a rare point guard in the league with top-notch defensive abilities. Ayton's presence on the court may be lower, but considering his draft position and salary, he is not necessarily worse than the players they received in return.</p> <p>This three-team trade is actually a win-win-win situation, not necessarily based on the players' skills, but because it meets the current needs of all three teams. The Bucks acquire a player for the postseason and a stable four-year period.</p> <p>Before discussing the Bucks' situation, it is important to emphasize a trend under the new collective bargaining agreement. The number of star players entering free agency and changing teams through the free agent market will decrease. Since 2019, there have been only two non-minimum-salary players, Gordon Hayward in 2020 and DeMar DeRozan in 2021, who have switched teams as free agents. Other star players have either re-signed with their current teams, signed extensions before becoming free agents, or traded and then re-signed before their contracts expired.</p> <p>The main reason for this phenomenon is that there are fewer teams with significant salary cap space, and even if there are, they are usually not competitive teams. With the new collective bargaining agreement and the introduction of the luxury tax line, teams will find it even more challenging to create enough salary cap space. Therefore, players who have friction with their current teams or uncertainty about their next contract will often request trades to teams that need them more, allowing them to continue earning high salaries without salary cap restrictions. What if a star player cannot stay with a team that really needs them and cannot be traded before their contract expires? The only option is to take a pay cut.</p> <p>Holiday has his issues, especially in the playoffs, where he has struggled throughout his career, except for one postseason with the Pelicans in 2017-18. In his three years with the Bucks, he has averaged 17.9 points in the playoffs with a 3P% of only 0.304 and an eFG% of only 0.453. In addition, he takes about 3.5 more shots per game in the playoffs compared to the regular season. Considering his salary and performance in the regular season, it can be said that he has severely underperformed. Both Holiday and Lillard are 33 years old, with their birthdays only a month apart. In terms of health, Lillard may appear worse due to his early ironman career, but apart from the 2021-22 season when Lillard had a more severe injury, they are relatively similar.</p> <p>Lillard's playoff performance is slightly inferior to his regular-season performance but not to the extent of Holiday. He also has multiple records of heroic game-saving shots, which adds a valuable weapon for the Bucks in the playoffs. However, besides the difference in playoff performance between the two players, another key factor is the contract issue.</p> <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo will turn 29 in the upcoming season, and he has two more years on his guaranteed contract, with a player option in 2025-26. Given Giannis' importance and significance to the Bucks, it is almost certain that he will sign a max extension in advance. The Bucks will only consider a changing of the guard after his next contract. However, his main supporting cast, Brook Lopez (35 years old), Holiday (33 years old), and Kris Middleton (32 years old), are best suited to accompany Giannis for the next 2-3 years, until his contract ends. They will inevitably face a wave of changes in their supporting cast. Lillard's contract runs until 2027, which allows the Bucks to stagger the process of finding replacements for their supporting cast. They won't have to find replacements for all three positions within a year or two or endure a one-time decline. Of course, Lillard will also decline, but the Bucks can seek opportunities to strengthen the team from other positions.</p>"},{"location":"20231011091325329713/","title":"NBADoncic returns to his former home, only plays for five minutes as Real Madrid beats the Mavericks in a comeback victory","text":"<p>Luka Doncic, Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez    NBADoncic returns to his former home, only plays for five minutes as Real Madrid beats the Mavericks in a comeback victory</p> <p>Luka Doncic, Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez.

Lin's decision to join the Kings was unexpected but not entirely surprising.</p> <p>Many Taiwanese basketball teams, including his former team the Kaohsiung Steel and the T1 LEAGUE's Taipei Fubon Braves, had expressed interest in signing Lin since he became a free agent. However, it was always clear that the Kings had the upper hand, as they had the valuable asset of Lin's younger brother, Lin Shu-Wei.</p> <p>It has always been Lin's dream to play alongside his brother, and even during their time in the SBL with the Taipei Fubon Braves, Lin expressed his openness to joining the league to team up with his brother. After joining the Kaohsiung Steel earlier this year, Lin mentioned in interviews that he and his brother had always wanted to be teammates rather than opponents. However, they felt that last season was not the right time for them to play together, as Lin Shu-Wei was having a successful season with the Kings.</p> <p>While there were rumors of Lin returning to the CBA, it seems that the limitations of the league's foreign player system and the physicality of the game were deterrents for him. The CBA's \"four quarters, four foreign players\" rule restricted his playing time and role in the past two seasons, even leading to his marginalization during his time with the Guangzhou Loong Lions last season.</p> <p>In contrast, playing in Taiwan allows Lin to fulfill his dream of playing basketball with his brother and offers incentives that the CBA cannot provide. Despite the physicality of the PLG, Lin's presence will undoubtedly benefit the Kings, as he has consistently shown his prowess on both ends of the court.</p> <p>Last season, Lin averaged 26.32 points, 8.47 rebounds, 8.89 assists, 1.84 steals, and 0.53 blocks per game, ranking first in scoring and assists, second in steals, and among the top guards in rebounds and blocks. He also set several milestones in the PLG, including a career-high 50 points in a single game, the highest-scoring half (32 points), and two games with the most assists (15 and 16). With a more complete roster in the Kings, Lin's performance is expected to reach new heights.</p> <p>Looking at the Kings' frontcourt, pairing Lin with a capable big man will be beneficial, as seen in his previous collaborations with Ekpe Udoh and Justin Hamilton in Beijing. Last season, the addition of Wendell Lewis, who had better physicality and competitiveness than Viacheslav Kravtsov, also contributed to Lin's improved performance with the Kaohsiung Steel.</p> <p>The Kings currently have several talented big men, including Tony Mitchell, who can attack the rim, Billy Preston as a stretch four, and Byron Mullens and Quincy Davis III, who possess all-around offensive abilities. With Lin's expertise in the pick-and-roll game, the Kings should be able to increase their tactical flexibility in the upcoming season.</p>"},{"location":"20231011091353883362/","title":"Coach Chiou Guo-Da, the Silent Cultivator of the Chang Yao Cup","text":"<p>\"I enjoy the process of building the future for children    Coach Chiou Guo-Da, the Silent Cultivator of the Chang Yao Cup</p> <p>\"I enjoy the process of building the future for children.\" Please continue reading.

The outstanding basketball players we see today, such as CBA's Guan-Da Yu, Jia-Kang Li, Jun-Xiang Lu, Jie-Min Lu, UBA's Xin-Hao Song, Lu-Shi Liu, Jie-Cheng Zhang, Guan-Lun Peng, HBL's Cheng-Han Tsai, Guan-Zhong Chen, Yi Quan, Jun-Yao Zhang, and the 2023 World University Games representative Zhang Zhen-Ya, all come from his nurturing.</p> <p>Furthermore, Miaoli Mingren Junior High School has achieved remarkable results in the JBHL over the years. Coach Chiou Guo-Da has been cultivating grassroots basketball at Mingren for nearly 30 years. He believes that besides focusing on basketball skills, grassroots basketball education should also emphasize the character development and academic achievement of players. \"A tree with deep roots won't be toppled by the wind.\" Having a strong foundation during student years is crucial for future success. Moreover, Coach Chiou has been quietly helping underprivileged children, demonstrating the true meaning of education without distinction.</p> <p>\"Grassroots basketball needs both hardware and software. Hardware includes venues, training environments, and funding sources, and the regional differences can lead to urban-rural disparities. It's essential for coaches promoting grassroots basketball to minimize such gaps.</p> <p>As for the software aspect, it involves consistent teaching materials and instructional content. A complete and seamless transition from beginners to professionals can have a positive impact.\"</p> <p>The progress made by Japan in the past decade is evident to all. Coach Chiou believes that as another East Asian country, if Japan can achieve it, Taiwan can do even better. The tenth edition of the Chang Yao Cup awarded Coach Chiou Guo-Da the \"Best Contribution Award\" at the opening ceremony. \"The Chang Yao Cup has grown larger and more refined over the years, providing substantial assistance from high school to university and from domestic to international levels.\" Coach Chiou expressed his gratitude for being honored with this award by the Chang Yao Cup and Chairman Xie Jian-Guo. He said, \"I am surprised and delighted. In Taiwan, there are definitely more people dedicated to grassroots sports and education than just me.\"</p> <p>During the award ceremony for Coach Chiou at the tenth Chang Yao Cup, nearly 30 young players attended to express their gratitude.</p> <p>\"Meticulously cultivating grassroots basketball is a spirit. As long as one is willing to persist and work hard, they will eventually be seen by more people and even be able to pass on and spread the importance of grassroots nurturing.\" Coach Chiou humbly expressed his gratitude and acknowledged that receiving this award only represents a representative among countless individuals dedicated to grassroots basketball. He hopes to encourage and share with more individuals who are also committed to promoting and preserving grassroots basketball. Grassroots education is a journey that has no end but a long road. While the future may not be clear, the beauty lies in appreciating the small changes along the way.</p>"},{"location":"20231012091132155230/","title":"According to the latest NBA preseason record predictions released by ESPN data expert Kevin Pelton, based on player performance data from the past three years and considering team luck (injury risk), it is calculated how many wins each team can average in the regular season","text":"<p>According to the latest NBA preseason record predictions released by ESPN data expert Kevin Pelton, based on player performance data from the past three years and considering team luck (injury risk), it is calculated how many wins each team can average in the regular season.

In fact, the team is made up of players who have won the HBL Division 2 championship in the 106th, 108th, and 109th academic years. They come from traditional powerhouses such as Taitung High School, Xinhua Vocational High School, Huideng High School, and Kaohsiung Vocational High School. This year, they not only participated in the senior division, but also won third place in the 3-on-3 tournament. Moreover, the team's joyful atmosphere has created a bond among the players, making them like brothers on the court. From high school to university, we have witnessed their growth and transformation, and we look forward to seeing them on more basketball courts. Please continue reading below.</p> <p>About the reunion of Dongzhong classmates, Xie Wenxiang said, \"I am really happy. It's been a long time since we played together, but we still have a familiar feeling and it brings back memories of our past experiences. I miss it and cherish this opportunity.\" This year at the TGF Cup, Xie Wenxiang also served as the team's assist leader, making numerous spectacular passes. With his organization on the court, the team's rhythm became smoother. As a senior division team this year, team captain Xu Yuxuan said, \"It's a different feeling to play with opponents from different places who have become teammates. It's quite fresh, and it feels like we're back in high school. We not only have high school teammates and opponents, but also university teammates. It's a special memory, and only the TGF Cup can bring us together to play.\"</p> <p>The spiritual leader of the team, Wu Haoqun, can often be heard cheering on his teammates from the sidelines. He once told his teammates, \"We all came here to play, but if we want to play happily, we must learn to share the ball.\" Seeing his determination on the court, we can understand that he wants to be on the court more than anyone else, but sharing is also part of the game. Sacrifice leads to gains, and this selfless team spirit is truly valuable. As a result, the team went far in the tournament, reaching the finals in the 5-on-5 tournament and winning third place in the 3-on-3 tournament. This was a fulfilling summer for them.</p> <p>In addition, Zeng Yuhao also had a good performance at this year's TGF Cup. He once hit seven three-pointers in a single game in the northern region preliminaries. Although he may not be the team's main scorer, he always provides the necessary firepower when the team needs it, making him the team's best sixth man.</p> <p>Xu Yongyang, who joined the team for the finals, also cherished this opportunity. He said, \"My goal in participating in the TGF Cup is the same as the TGF team's, to uphold the spirit of inheritance and sustainability. Winning or losing is secondary in sports, and I value the teamwork and interaction on and off the court. Only through this can we truly understand the rewards that this game brings. I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this event with my classmates from National Taiwan Sport University this year. Everyone has selflessly contributed on the court, and although we only met for the first time, we have formed a strong bond. This experience has allowed me to fully experience the charm of basketball and get to know players from different places. I hope to form another team and play together happily next year!\"</p> <p>Having a team composed of multiple HBL Division 2 champions is a special combination. From opponents in the past to teammates now, they have come together because of basketball and have made more friends through basketball. This is the beauty of basketball. Moreover, they not only come to compete, but also help clean up the court and surrounding areas after the games or during breaks. This, I believe, is the essence of grassroots basketball, making basketball more than just a game.</p>"},{"location":"20231013040919654822/","title":"In the video, NBA player Dillon Brooks was ejected from the game against the Rockets after only five minutes on the court due to a level two flagrant foul","text":"<p>In the video, NBA player Dillon Brooks was ejected from the game against the Rockets after only five minutes on the court due to a level two flagrant foul.

They also filed a joint claim against Taishin for joint tort liability and violation of Article 25 of the Fair Trade Act.</p> <p>In addition, they have also filed a complaint with the Fair Trade Commission against Taishin.</p>"},{"location":"20231013091151681809/","title":"\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u767c\u8868\u8072\u660e\uff0c\u5c0dT1\u806f\u76df\u7684\u6c7a\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u5f37\u70c8\u6297\u8b70\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70baT1\u806f\u76df\u7684\u4f5c\u6cd5\u7c97\u66b4\u7121\u7406\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u9055\u53cd\u4e86\u806f\u76df\u898f\u7ae0\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u5c0b\u6c42\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9014\u5f91\u634d\u885b\u81ea\u8eab\u6b0a\u76ca\u3002","text":"<p>\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u662f\u4e00\u652f\u5177\u6709\u60a0\u4e45\u6b77\u53f2\u7684\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4e00\u76f4\u9075\u5b88\u806f\u76df\u898f\u7bc4\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u8ca2\u737b\u65bc\u806f\u76df\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7121\u6cd5\u63a5\u53d7T1\u806f\u76df\u7684\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u9019\u4e0d\u50c5\u5f71\u97ff\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7403\u968a\u7684\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c0d\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u7684\u7403\u8ff7\u548c\u8d0a\u52a9\u5546\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u640d\u5931\u3002</p> <p>\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671bT1\u806f\u76df\u80fd\u5920\u91cd\u65b0\u5be9\u8996\u9019\u500b\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5c0a\u91cd\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u652f\u7403\u968a\u7684\u6b0a\u76ca\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u5c07\u7e7c\u7e8c\u8207\u806f\u76df\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u63a8\u52d5\u7c43\u7403\u904b\u52d5\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u3002</p> <p>\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u5c07\u5c0b\u6c42\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9014\u5f91\uff0c\u634d\u885b\u81ea\u8eab\u6b0a\u76ca\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0d\u6703\u518d\u767c\u751f\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u547c\u7c72T1\u806f\u76df\u8207\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u4e00\u540c\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u70ba\u7c43\u7403\u904b\u52d5\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8ca2\u737b\u3002</p> <p>Taiwan's Taichung Sun release statement protesting against T1 League's decision   \u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u767c\u8868\u8072\u660e\uff0c\u5c0dT1\u806f\u76df\u7684\u6c7a\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u5f37\u70c8\u6297\u8b70\u3002\u6211\u5011\u8a8d\u70baT1\u806f\u76df\u7684\u4f5c\u6cd5\u7c97\u66b4\u7121\u7406\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u9055\u53cd\u4e86\u806f\u76df\u898f\u7ae0\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u5c0b\u6c42\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9014\u5f91\u634d\u885b\u81ea\u8eab\u6b0a\u76ca\u3002</p> <p>\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u662f\u4e00\u652f\u5177\u6709\u60a0\u4e45\u6b77\u53f2\u7684\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4e00\u76f4\u9075\u5b88\u806f\u76df\u898f\u7bc4\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u8ca2\u737b\u65bc\u806f\u76df\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u3002\u6211\u5011\u7121\u6cd5\u63a5\u53d7T1\u806f\u76df\u7684\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u9019\u4e0d\u50c5\u5f71\u97ff\u4e86\u6211\u5011\u7403\u968a\u7684\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c0d\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u7684\u7403\u8ff7\u548c\u8d0a\u52a9\u5546\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u640d\u5931\u3002</p> <p>\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671bT1\u806f\u76df\u80fd\u5920\u91cd\u65b0\u5be9\u8996\u9019\u500b\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5c0a\u91cd\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u4f5c\u70ba\u4e00\u652f\u7403\u968a\u7684\u6b0a\u76ca\u3002\u6211\u5011\u4e5f\u5c07\u7e7c\u7e8c\u8207\u806f\u76df\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u63a8\u52d5\u7c43\u7403\u904b\u52d5\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u3002</p> <p>\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u5c07\u5c0b\u6c42\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9014\u5f91\uff0c\u634d\u885b\u81ea\u8eab\u6b0a\u76ca\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5e0c\u671b\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0d\u6703\u518d\u767c\u751f\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u547c\u7c72T1\u806f\u76df\u8207\u81fa\u4e2d\u592a\u967d\u4e00\u540c\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u70ba\u7c43\u7403\u904b\u52d5\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8ca2\u737b\u3002</p> <p>Taiwan's Taichung Sun release statement protesting against T1 League's decision. Photo/Taichung Sun</p> <p>Earlier today, T1 League announced that Taichung Sun will not be able to participate in the 2023-2024 season due to financial irregularities, despite multiple reviews by the league's executive council. In response, Taichung Sun released a statement protesting against T1 League's decision, citing their actions as aggressive and unjustified. The following is the statement released by Taichung Sun:</p> <p>Taichung Sun Statement. Photo/Taichung Sun</p> <p>We strongly protest against T1 League's decision. We believe that their actions were aggressive and unjustified, and have violated the league's regulations. We will seek legal means to defend our rights and interests.</p> <p>Taichung Sun is a team with a long history, and we have always followed the league's regulations and contributed to its development. We cannot accept T1 League's decision as it not only affects our team's interests, but also causes unnecessary losses for our fans and sponsors.</p> <p>We hope that T1 League will reconsider this decision and respect Taichung Sun's rights as a team. We will continue to work with the league to promote the development of basketball.</p> <p>Lastly, Taichung Sun will seek legal means to defend our rights and interests. We hope that such a situation will not happen again, and we urge T1 League to work together with Taichung Sun to make better contributions to the future of basketball.</p>"},{"location":"20231013091159534168/","title":"So it finally happened, Deandre Ayton has been traded from the Suns to the Bucks as part of a three-team deal between the Trail Blazers, Bucks, and Suns","text":"<p>So it finally happened, Deandre Ayton has been traded from the Suns to the Bucks as part of a three-team deal between the Trail Blazers, Bucks, and Suns.</p> <p>The trade, which was announced by renowned reporter Adrian Wojnarowski, includes Jrue Holiday and Damian Lillard in addition to Ayton. The Suns will receive Jusuf Nurkic, Grayson Allen, Nassir Little, and Keon Johnson, as well as the Bucks' unprotected first-round pick in 2029 and swap rights in 2028 and 2030. </p> <p>Lillard will now join forces with Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, and Brook Lopez in Milwaukee, forming one of the strongest four-man lineups in the Eastern Conference. This move comes after Antetokounmpo's declaration that he wants to stay with the Bucks and compete for a championship, even if it means sacrificing comfort and making sacrifices for the team. </p> <p>For the Trail Blazers, this marks the end of the Lillard era. While many expected Lillard to join the Miami Heat, he instead heads to the Midwest to lead the Bucks. The Trail Blazers also sent Nurkic, Little, and Johnson in addition to Lillard. </p> <p>As for the Suns, this trade seems to be a questionable move. While Ayton has had some underwhelming performances in the playoffs, trading him for the package they received seems like a move made just for the sake of making a move. </p> <p>Why did they trade Ayton? And why did they trade him for this? It's true that Ayton has had some disappointing moments in the playoffs, but he's also had to deal with several challenges during his time with the Suns. In his rookie year, the Suns didn't even have a competent point guard to help him develop. And in the following seasons, he had to adjust to playing with high-caliber point guards like Ricky Rubio and Chris Paul. </p> <p>While Ayton's numbers may have decreased with Paul's arrival, his advanced stats show that he's still improving. The only problem is that the Suns' timeline was accelerated with Paul's addition, and Ayton's flaws as a championship-caliber center were exposed. </p> <p>Overall, this trade may seem like a strange move for the Suns, and it remains to be seen if it will benefit them in the long run. As for Ayton, he will now have the opportunity to prove himself with the Bucks and potentially win a championship. The trade also raises questions about Holiday's future with the Trail Blazers, as it's possible that he may be on the move again soon. Only time will tell how this trade will ultimately impact all three teams involved.</p>"},{"location":"20231013091205241199/","title":"Banchi\u7684\u5230\u4efb\u4e5f\u610f\u5473\u8457\u6ce2\u9686\u90a3\u5c07\u6703\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u958b\u59cb\uff0c\u4ed6\u5c07\u6703\u9818\u5c0e\u4e00\u652f\u65b0\u9663\u5bb9\u7684\u6ce2\u9686\u90a3\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u6311\u6230\u51a0\u8ecd\u7684\u5922\u60f3\u3002\u9019\u4e5f\u662f\u7403\u968a\u8457\u91cd\u63a8\u5ee3\u65b0\u9bae\u8840\u6db2\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u900f\u904e\u65b0\u6559\u7df4\u7684\u9818\u5c0e\u80fd\u5920\u5e36\u4f86\u65b0\u7684\u6c23\u8c61\uff0c\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u5728\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u3002","text":"<p>Banchi\u7684\u5230\u4efb\u4e5f\u610f\u5473\u8457\u6ce2\u9686\u90a3\u5c07\u6703\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u958b\u59cb\uff0c\u4ed6\u5c07\u6703\u9818\u5c0e\u4e00\u652f\u65b0\u9663\u5bb9\u7684\u6ce2\u9686\u90a3\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u6311\u6230\u51a0\u8ecd\u7684\u5922\u60f3\u3002\u9019\u4e5f\u662f\u7403\u968a\u8457\u91cd\u63a8\u5ee3\u65b0\u9bae\u8840\u6db2\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u900f\u904e\u65b0\u6559\u7df4\u7684\u9818\u5c0e\u80fd\u5920\u5e36\u4f86\u65b0\u7684\u6c23\u8c61\uff0c\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u5728\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231013091207815598/","title":"\u97d3\u570b\u90e8\u843d\u5ba2Anthony Bennett has left the KBL team and is currently looking for a new team in Taiwan","text":"<p>\u97d3\u570b\u90e8\u843d\u5ba2Anthony Bennett has left the KBL team and is currently looking for a new team in Taiwan.

He only played in 17 games for the Jutland Lions last season, averaging 22.6 points, 12.2 rebounds, 2.9 assists, and 3.3 steals per game. </p>"},{"location":"20231013091210512482/","title":"\u96d6\u7136\u5728\u672c\u6b21\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u672a\u80fd\u7372\u5f97\u51a0\u8ecd\uff0c\u4f46\u7403\u968a\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4ecd\u7136\u8b93\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u3002\u9019\u6b21\u7684\u6311\u6230\u4e5f\u7d66\u4e86\u7403\u54e1\u5011\u4e00\u500b\u6a5f\u6703\uff0c\u8b93\u4ed6\u5011\u9ad4\u9a57\u4e00\u5834\u4e0d\u540c\u65bcNBA\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\uff0c\u4e26\u5e0c\u671b\u4ed6\u5011\u80fd\u5f9e\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e26\u6210\u9577\u3002","text":"<p>\u6700\u7d42\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u7537\u7c43\u5c07\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u76c3\u7684\u9738\u4e3b\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5fc5\u9808\u9762\u5c0d\u7684\u73fe\u5be6\u3002\u4f46\u9019\u4e5f\u5c07\u6fc0\u52f5\u4ed6\u5011\u66f4\u52a0\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u4e16\u754c\u76c3\u4e2d\u91cd\u56de\u5dd4\u5cf0\u3002   \u96d6\u7136\u5728\u672c\u6b21\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u672a\u80fd\u7372\u5f97\u51a0\u8ecd\uff0c\u4f46\u7403\u968a\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4ecd\u7136\u8b93\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u3002\u9019\u6b21\u7684\u6311\u6230\u4e5f\u7d66\u4e86\u7403\u54e1\u5011\u4e00\u500b\u6a5f\u6703\uff0c\u8b93\u4ed6\u5011\u9ad4\u9a57\u4e00\u5834\u4e0d\u540c\u65bcNBA\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\uff0c\u4e26\u5e0c\u671b\u4ed6\u5011\u80fd\u5f9e\u4e2d\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e26\u6210\u9577\u3002</p> <p>\u6700\u7d42\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u7537\u7c43\u5c07\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u76c3\u7684\u9738\u4e3b\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5fc5\u9808\u9762\u5c0d\u7684\u73fe\u5be6\u3002\u4f46\u9019\u4e5f\u5c07\u6fc0\u52f5\u4ed6\u5011\u66f4\u52a0\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u4e16\u754c\u76c3\u4e2d\u91cd\u56de\u5dd4\u5cf0\u3002 </p>"},{"location":"20231013091213219424/","title":"\u6839\u64da\u8a18\u8005Shams Charania\u7684\u5831\u5c0e\uff0c\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u4e0d\u6253\u7b97\u7c3d\u4e0b\u8001\u5c07Dwight Howard\u7b49\u4e2d\u92d2\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7403\u968a\u7684\u85aa\u8cc7\u7a7a\u9593\u5f48\u6027\u3002Shams Charania\u5728\u5f71\u7247\u4e2d\u8aaa\u9053\uff1a\u300c\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u76ee\u524d\u4e26\u6c92\u6709\u8207\u9b54\u7378\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u8a08\u756b\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u4e26\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u672a\u4f86\u4e0d\u6703\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u3002\u300d\u4ed6\u4e5f\u88dc\u5145\u9053\uff1a\u300c\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u5e0c\u671b\u4fdd\u6301\u7403\u968a\u7684\u5f48\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u88dc\u5f37\u3002\u300d\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u7a4d\u6975\u5c0b\u627e\u80fd\u5920\u63d0\u5347\u7403\u968a\u5be6\u529b\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u5011\u4e0d\u6703\u8f15\u6613\u72a7\u7272\u7403\u968a\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u767c\u5c55\u3002\u9019\u4e5f\u4ee3\u8868\u8457\uff0c\u9664\u975eHoward\u80fd\u5920\u63d0\u4f9b\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u7121\u6cd5\u62d2\u7d55\u7684\u512a\u52e2\uff0c\u5426\u5247\u4ed6\u5011\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u8207\u4ed6\u7c3d\u4e0b\u5408\u7d04\u3002","text":"<p>\u6839\u64da\u8a18\u8005Shams Charania\u7684\u5831\u5c0e\uff0c\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u4e0d\u6253\u7b97\u7c3d\u4e0b\u8001\u5c07Dwight Howard\u7b49\u4e2d\u92d2\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7403\u968a\u7684\u85aa\u8cc7\u7a7a\u9593\u5f48\u6027\u3002Shams Charania\u5728\u5f71\u7247\u4e2d\u8aaa\u9053\uff1a\u300c\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u76ee\u524d\u4e26\u6c92\u6709\u8207\u9b54\u7378\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u8a08\u756b\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u4e26\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u672a\u4f86\u4e0d\u6703\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u3002\u300d\u4ed6\u4e5f\u88dc\u5145\u9053\uff1a\u300c\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u5e0c\u671b\u4fdd\u6301\u7403\u968a\u7684\u5f48\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u88dc\u5f37\u3002\u300d\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u7a4d\u6975\u5c0b\u627e\u80fd\u5920\u63d0\u5347\u7403\u968a\u5be6\u529b\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u5011\u4e0d\u6703\u8f15\u6613\u72a7\u7272\u7403\u968a\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u767c\u5c55\u3002\u9019\u4e5f\u4ee3\u8868\u8457\uff0c\u9664\u975eHoward\u80fd\u5920\u63d0\u4f9b\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u7121\u6cd5\u62d2\u7d55\u7684\u512a\u52e2\uff0c\u5426\u5247\u4ed6\u5011\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u8207\u4ed6\u7c3d\u4e0b\u5408\u7d04\u3002 </p>"},{"location":"20231014091132101564/","title":"According to recent reports, Oklahoma City plans to build a new arena for the local NBA team, the Thunder","text":"<p>According to recent reports, Oklahoma City plans to build a new arena for the local NBA team, the Thunder.

Mayor David Holt stated in a press release regarding the new arena, \"The majority of our citizens have expressed a desire to see the Thunder remain in our city for the long term, and we have worked hard to make that happen without raising taxes. This agreement is a win-win, and the most important aspect is the length of time the Thunder has agreed to stay \u2013 twice as long as the commitment we made in 2008 \u2013 until 2050.

The James Harden trade may eventually happen, or there may be a player who becomes available and sparks the interest of the 76ers.</p> <p>Please continue reading about Kelly Oubre Jr., the veteran wing player that Philadelphia signed this summer. Although some 76ers fans may have doubts or complaints about this signing, adding Oubre Jr. with a veteran minimum contract could greatly benefit the team's wing rotation. In fact, the 76ers' roster is already stacked with talented players, including MVP Joel Embiid and one of the most charismatic young stars in the NBA, Tyrese Maxey.</p> <p>De'Anthony Melton has returned after an impressive first season with the 76ers, Paul Reed has a new contract and has a chance to play a new role under Nick Nurse.</p> <p>But there are still plenty of question marks on this roster. Tobias Harris and P.J. Tucker are the starting power forwards for next season, and it's up to you to decide who is the small forward or power forward. Behind them, the bench wings include Oubre Jr., Danuel House Jr., Furkan Korkmaz, and Danny Green, making for a highly competitive team. Please continue reading. However, among this group of players, Oubre is clearly the most talented and has a more impressive NBA career in terms of age and experience.</p> <p>Let's start with his biggest weakness - efficiency. Throughout his NBA career, his true shooting percentage has fluctuated greatly. If we are looking for a reason to be optimistic, it may be that his true shooting percentage has improved every year, reaching 53.4% last season. At the same time, his turnover rate is a bit high for a player like him, averaging more turnovers (1.1) than assists (1.0) per game throughout his career. In other words, if Oubre gets the ball, there is a good chance it will end up away from him. This is not necessarily the worst thing, as he can make up for the hesitation of players like Harris or Tucker when taking open shots.</p> <p>Having a scoring player off the bench who can create his own opportunities to replace Embiid or Maxey should be a good thing.</p> <p>As a highly anticipated lottery pick, Oubre's performance in the NBA has not lived up to expectations. However, his potential is still something to look forward to. Standing at 198cm with an impressive wingspan of 220cm, combined with his athleticism, he is still an attractive wing player.</p> <p>In addition, he has defensive potential, but his effort can be inconsistent. And it should be noted that Oubre is only 27 years old and just had a season where he averaged more than 20 points per game. The best he can get is a veteran minimum contract with the 76ers, which is obviously a crossroads in his career. He is now on a path that we have seen many players take. When you have the ability but can't find a place on a championship-contending team, the best bet is to prove yourself and hope for a bigger contract in the future. Bobby Portis is probably the most successful example of this strategy. Portis was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the 2015 draft and has obvious talent. Although Portis has had some success, he was not a highly sought-after player while playing for the Washington Wizards and New York Knicks, so it was a bit surprising when he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2020.</p> <p>However, Portis was a key player off the bench for the Bucks and became one of the heroes of their championship run that season.</p> <p>Portis ultimately signed a 4-year, $48.5 million contract with the Bucks, which is a great turnaround story and proves that this kind of comeback from the bottom is not unprecedented.</p> <p>Oubre and his agent, Torrel Harris, also understand that the 76ers will have enough salary cap space next season and will have Oubre's Bird rights, giving them a great chance to re-sign him.</p> <p>In conclusion, it is a wise move for the 76ers to sign talented players like Oubre to a veteran minimum contract a few weeks before training camp starts. There is almost no downside to this move from a basketball perspective, unlike the situation with James Harden, which is currently a disaster and affecting every decision the 76ers make.

Yesterday's Asian Games men's basketball game was full of surprises, with both Korea and the Chinese men's basketball team, who came out with a strong lineup, showing an unstable performance. Korea fell behind from the beginning of the game and struggled to defend against the outside shooting of the Japanese team. Although the Chinese team won against Mongolia, they were constantly torn apart by the speed and found themselves in a difficult situation. The lack of preparation and unclear defensive strategies may make their journey in the next round even more challenging.</p> <p>Please continue reading \u25bc The Korean media was furious. The young Japanese team played with all their might. They finished 17th in the previous World Cup and secured their spot in next year's Paris Olympics, jumping to 26th in the world rankings, making them a new power in Asian men's basketball. Except for 18-year-old Kawaishima Yuto who plays abroad, the rest of the Japanese team consists of domestic league players who have not participated in international competitions. There are not even any naturalized players, so they were not highly regarded in this year's Hangzhou Asian Games.</p> <p>In contrast, Korea sent out their top players, including naturalized player Ra Gun-a, high-quality guards Kim Sun-hyeon, Heo Hun, Byun Jun-hyeong, Kwon Seong-hyeon, and big men Ha Yoon-geun and Lee Seong-hyeon. They have a solid line-up in every position and are expected to compete for a medal.</p> <p>With both teams winning their first two games, their matchup will determine who will advance to the next round as the first place in their group. However, the game took an unexpected turn as Japan started with a 13-0 run, with Korea struggling to catch up. In the second quarter, Japan's Kaya Juta continued to hit shots from the outside, and both teams engaged in a three-point shooting battle. Japan had a stable shooting performance with multiple players contributing, while Korea relied solely on Ra Gun-a, Heo Hun, and Ha Yoon-geun. Japan ended the first half with a 6-point lead.</p> <p>After halftime, Japan went on a 5-0 run to extend their lead to 11 points, but Korea fought back with their twin towers inside, tying the game at 48. However, Japan changed their strategy, attacking with speed and then switching to outside shooting. Ichikawa Masato hit two three-pointers to regain momentum and maintain their lead over Korea.</p> <p>In the final quarter, Korea focused on attacking the paint and had some success, while Japan struggled to score. However, with Kaya Juta and Heo Hun leading the way, Korea couldn't catch up as more and more players stepped up for Japan. Japan eventually won 83-77, leaving everyone in shock.</p> <p>Heo Hun scored 24 points with 6 three-pointers, while their big men each contributed 12 points. However, Korea's biggest issue was their defense. Despite their poor shooting, Japan made 17 three-pointers, with Kaya Juta scoring 22 points, leading the team to a collective victory.</p> <p>Please continue reading (picture source: JBA Japan Basketball Association official Facebook page) \u25bc Speed, teamwork, and Mongolia's tough game. After securing their spot in the next round as the top team in their group, the Chinese team needed to win their last game to advance as the second place. Although they had a huge lead, they faced a challenging game against Mongolia yesterday.</p> <p>In the first quarter, both teams were evenly matched, with China scoring in the half-court and Mongolia using their speed to transition. In the second quarter, Xie Yaxuan came off the bench to hit a three-pointer, extending their lead to 6 points. However, Mongolia's fast-paced offense didn't stop, constantly rotating their players and shooting as soon as they got the ball. They tore apart China's defense and took the lead. If it weren't for the main players stepping up, China would have been even further behind. Please continue reading In the second half, Mongolia continued to lead, with China struggling to rebound and protect the paint. It wasn't until Abassi was fouled for unsportsmanlike conduct that they regained the lead. However, Mongolia went on a 5-0 run right before the end of the game, almost taking away their hard-earned lead. Fortunately, China held on to win 78-75 and advance to the next round. Mongolia had a good shooting performance, hitting 11 three-pointers compared to China's 19 shots with only 5 going in. They also caused 15 turnovers and converted them into 16 points, using their speed to their advantage. China's top players, Abassi with 27 points and 8 rebounds, and Atinuo with 18 points and 4 steals, led the team. However, the CBA duo had a poor shooting night, and the other players were quiet, making it difficult to keep up with the game in the middle. China, who had a clear advantage in the paint, should have easily won against Mongolia, who were not considered a traditional powerhouse in five-on-five basketball. However, they were in a tough situation throughout the game, and it was clear that the team was not in their best form. (picture source: Chinese Olympic Committee official website, Hangzhou Asian Games official website screenshot) \u25bc Misunderstood as evenly matched, the lack of preparation makes the situation unclear. If we only look at the game statistics, we might think that the two teams are evenly matched. However, that is not the case. Japan didn't even send their top team, and their average age is under 30, with 3 players born after 2000. It's clear that they are focused on developing their young players. Mongolia is in a similar situation, not to mention that they are not a traditional powerhouse in five-on-five basketball. Watching the game and clips, it's clear that China and Korea didn't do enough preparation. They didn't understand their opponents' offensive strategies and key players, and their defense was the main reason for their struggles. Japan used a lot of screens to find open shooters, while Mongolia used their speed to tear apart China's defense and attack the basket. </p>"},{"location":"20231014091158546919/","title":"Kerr\u6700\u5f8c\u4e5f\u8aaa\u5230\u4ed6\u5c0dPayton\u7684\u671f\u5f85\uff1a\u300c\u4ed6\u5c0d\u65bc\u6211\u5011\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f88\u9ad8\u8208\u4ed6\u80fd\u56de\u4f86\uff0c\u4ed6\u662f\u6211\u5011\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u54e1\u3002\u300d","text":"<p>NBA Kerr Discusses Warriors' Defensive Goals to Rebuild Top 10 Defense in the League GPII Is an Important Player for Us</p> <p>Today marks the official start of training camp for all teams in the league, and Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr discussed the team's defensive strategy for the season    Kerr\u6700\u5f8c\u4e5f\u8aaa\u5230\u4ed6\u5c0dPayton\u7684\u671f\u5f85\uff1a\u300c\u4ed6\u5c0d\u65bc\u6211\u5011\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5f88\u9ad8\u8208\u4ed6\u80fd\u56de\u4f86\uff0c\u4ed6\u662f\u6211\u5011\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u54e1\u3002\u300d</p> <p>NBA Kerr Discusses Warriors' Defensive Goals to Rebuild Top 10 Defense in the League GPII Is an Important Player for Us</p> <p>Today marks the official start of training camp for all teams in the league, and Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr discussed the team's defensive strategy for the season. He stated that their goal is to rebuild their defense, with a specific focus on having Klay Thompson guard the power forward position and highlighting the importance of Gary Payton II as a key defensive player for the team.</p> <p>Kerr first addressed the strengths of their starting frontcourt players: \"Looney protects the paint, Green covers the entire court like a safety in American football, and Wiggins will need to guard wings from all teams in the league.\"</p> <p>When it comes to their starting lineup, Kerr will likely have Chris Paul, Curry, and Thompson on the court together at times. In these situations, Thompson will guard the power forward position alongside Looney/Green and Wiggins. Kerr explained, \"Thompson will be guarding the four this season, as he is physically strong. He will switch onto low-post players after defensive rotations, and we believe he can handle guarding the four. We plan to use this defensive setup against teams running pick-and-roll plays to see how he performs.\"</p> <p>Kerr also mentioned another strong player in their defense, Chris Paul. He described him as \"strong as a rock or brick,\" making it difficult for opponents to switch onto him. However, it will depend on the team's defensive strategy and who they want Paul to guard. Finally, Kerr mentioned Gary Payton II as a key name in their defensive strategy. He sees him as the core of the Warriors' defense, excelling at guarding ball-handlers. Although he only played in 23 games last season, Kerr believes that his return will make rebuilding their defense much easier. He also expects Payton to be part of the Warriors' rotation.</p> <p>Kerr stated, \"I expect him to come off the bench like two years ago, and I anticipate him having important minutes on the court. If he continues to contribute, I will keep him on the court.\" As for his jersey number for the new season, Payton will return to wearing the number 0 jersey, as it was taken by another player after he was traded last season.</p> <p>Finally, Kerr expressed his expectations for Payton: \"He has a significant impact on our defense, and we are glad to have him back. He is an essential member of our team.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231014091204645490/","title":"Dillon Brooks made his first appearance for the Houston Rockets in their preseason game against the Indiana Pacers","text":"<p>Dillon Brooks made his first appearance for the Houston Rockets in their preseason game against the Indiana Pacers.

If this 2023 draft pick lives up to everyone's expectations, Gregg Popovich and Brian Wright will build the team around him with players that suit his style.</p> <p>The first step in this process is to find a suitable starting lineup for him. It's no secret that Wembanyama is likely to play power forward, which means someone from last season's roster, other than Zach Collins, will have to be pushed out. The obvious answer is the player who played that position last season, Jeremy Sochan, but his uniqueness adds complexity to the situation.</p> <p>Please continue reading Is Sochan really a power forward? Technically, he is, but some players break the outdated position definitions, and he is one of them. Part of it is due to his performance, and part of it is how the Spurs use him. As the team is in a rebuilding phase and not focused on winning, they have given this rookie enough freedom to find his own direction in the league and experiment with his role.</p> <p>Sochan has defended against many power forwards and other players with similar builds, but he has also spent just as much time defending guards, not just because of the team's defensive system.</p> <p>The same goes for offense. Sochan sometimes takes initiative, and sometimes he stays close to the basket. It's clear that Popovich wants to see if Sochan is versatile and can be \"more than just\" a traditional power forward.</p> <p>It's worth noting that Sochan has performed well in many aspects, especially considering his lack of experience.</p> <p>The question is, can he be a \"Swiss Army knife\" player who can't be categorized throughout his career, or does he need to stop doing what he can do and focus on what he's good at to reach his potential? Please continue reading In general, this is not an urgent question, but with Wembanyama's arrival and his expected position as the starting power forward in the near future, it becomes crucial whether Sochan can play small forward or become a player who can fit any position.</p> <p>When it comes to specialized skills, being versatile is an advantage, and having many skills also means being better suited to be the second option on the Spurs in the future.</p> <p>Will Sochan be able to complement the future team center by playing alongside Wembanyama? He should be able to defend, as mentioned earlier, he can defend wings and guards, and he can also shoulder the toughest tasks at the power forward position, allowing Wembanyama to roam and provide help defense. As for his rebounding, even if his stats are affected by playing next to two tall players, it will still help him as it allows him to start fast breaks.</p> <p>However, his fit with the team still remains a big question mark - after all, Sochan lacks a reliable shooting ability, and this could make things complicated in half-court situations. Sochan does things in a completely non-traditional way - shooting free throws with one hand, improving his free throw shooting from 59% in college to 70%, and his three-point shooting percentage is only 24%, lower than his 29% in college.</p> <p>Please continue reading Perhaps the iron king can also become a sharpshooter, but all things considered, Sochan is not a natural shooter, and this could be a concern as Wembanyama is still inconsistent with his shooting range and needs some space to operate when trying to shoot. Photo source: Getty Images Of course, it's not fair to focus too much on what Sochan can't do. Even as a rookie, he has shown that he can punish smaller players in the backcourt and penetrate through taller players.</p> <p>No matter which forward or guard Wembanyama is facing, Sochan can create advantages elsewhere or defend mismatches.</p> <p>Since Sochan already has the mindset of a role player and glue guy, it shouldn't be difficult for him to continue playing a supporting role, and having Sochan play alongside Wembanyama may bring some advantages. But can these advantages outweigh the benefits of having Keldon Johnson play small forward in a traditional lineup? Johnson's scoring ability, emerging ball-handling skills, and inconsistent but continuously improving three-point shooting all make him a better fit for a young Wembanyama. An opposing argument is that what's best for the team doesn't matter, and even though Sochan's career started as a power forward, he could also move to the perimeter as time goes on, but there is also a risk that this may not happen. It's undeniable that Wembanyama's arrival is a good thing for the Spurs, but a secondary issue arises - how to use a rookie who showed great potential and is a vital two-way player at the power forward position. Sochan could play at both forward positions next season (or even as a guard if Popovich wants to experiment), so there's no need to make any extreme decisions right now, but Sochan must prove as soon as possible that he can play a useful role next to Wembanyama or take on the role of the sixth man.</p> <p>In this way, the Spurs can fully utilize the potential of both players and minimize potential conflicts, which is an important consideration for a young team. However, don't forget about Sochan's potential, he may become a key player for the Spurs in the years to come.</p>"},{"location":"20231014091243847478/","title":"Latvia's Luca Banchi was selected as the Best Coach of the World Cup","text":"<p>Latvia's Luca Banchi was selected as the Best Coach of the World Cup.

Photo/ Chinese Olympic Committee. Today, the Chinese basketball team lost to the host team, Mainland China, by a score of 69-89, crushing their hopes of securing the top spot in their group at the Hangzhou Asian Games. 39-year-old veteran player Wen-Ding Tseng admitted that the team has shown improvement during their long training period, but \"honestly, it's still not enough.\" Since starting their training in June of this year, the Chinese men's basketball team has gone through training camps in Japan, participated in the Jones Cup, and traveled to Australia for 2 weeks. However, their results at the Hangzhou Asian Games have been disappointing. While they were able to defeat Hong Kong in their first game, their offense faltered in the first half today, leading to a 20-point deficit and ultimately a loss. Tseng, who returned to the national team after a break, bluntly said, \"After such a long training period, there is improvement, but honestly, it's still not enough. We need to continue to improve and get better in the limited time we have.\"</p> <p>Tseng pointed out the team's problems, mentioning that all of the players are key players on their respective club teams, but when they come together as a national team, they have to adjust their roles and mindset. They must find ways to contribute to the team within the limited time and opportunities they have.</p> <p>The Chinese team has been hit hard by injuries in the backcourt this year. Starting point guard Ying-Jun Chen was unable to play in the Asian Games due to injury, forcing shooting guard Ting-Qian Lin to step in as the primary playmaker. Despite recording 7 assists, Lin self-critically evaluated his performance as \"failing\" in his role as point guard. The team will have to reflect on their mistakes and work harder in their next games in the group stage.</p> <p>At 23 years old, Lin joined the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) draft in 2020 and played for the Tianjin Ronggang Pioneer team. He recently signed a 3-year max contract to stay in Tianjin. Today, he was also a target for Chinese media. Lin mentioned that after 3 seasons in the CBA, he expected there to be high-intensity physical battles in today's game. In reality, there wasn't much difference from playing in the CBA, but the atmosphere at the Asian Games and in the CBA league are completely different. The referees also have different standards, making it a unique experience.</p>"},{"location":"20231015091133942023/","title":"\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u585e\u723e\u63d0\u514b\u7684\u85aa\u8cc7\u7a7a\u9593\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u61c9\u8a72\u662f\u8001\u95c6\u4e0d\u9858\u610f\u518d\u591a\u7e73\u90a31","text":"<p>\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u585e\u723e\u63d0\u514b\u7684\u85aa\u8cc7\u7a7a\u9593\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u61c9\u8a72\u662f\u8001\u95c6\u4e0d\u9858\u610f\u518d\u591a\u7e73\u90a31.4M\u7684\u5962\u4f88\u7a05\uff0c\u5c31\u5118\u5feb\u628aWilliams III\u9001\u8d70\u5427\u3002\u4e0d\u904e\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5f8c\u7684\u7591\u554f\uff0c\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u6703\u9078\u64c7\u9001\u51faWilliams III\u800c\u4e0d\u662fPayton Pritchard\uff1f\u6211\u60f3\u6216\u8a31\u662f\u56e0\u70baPritchard\u9084\u5728\u7403\u968a\u7684\u8a08\u756b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46Williams III\u537b\u6c92\u6709\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9084\u662f\u9078\u64c7\u628a\u4ed6\u9001\u8d70\u3002</p> <p>\u7e3d\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u9019\u6b21\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u5c0d\u585e\u723e\u63d0\u514b\u4f86\u8aaa\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6539\u8b8a\uff0c\u7403\u968a\u7684\u9663\u5bb9\u3001\u85aa\u8cc7\u7a7a\u9593\u90fd\u53d7\u5230\u4e86\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u800c\u9019\u4e5f\u8b93\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u5145\u6eff\u4e86\u7591\u60d1\u8207\u4e0d\u5b89\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u9019\u6b21\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u80fd\u5920\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u5e36\u4f86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u8207\u52dd\u5229\uff0c\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u62ed\u76ee\u4ee5\u5f85\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u5230\u4f86\u3002The Green Blood Ubon Trade: It's Time for a Holiday</p> <p>The holiday trade has brought changes to the Celtics.</p> <p>Trade Details: Celtics send: Continue reading below for more informationMalcolm BrogdonRobert Williams III2024 Warriors First Round Pick (acquired in KP trade)2029 Celtics First Round Pick (unprotected)Continue reading below for more informationTrail Blazers send: Jrue Holiday</p> <p>Team Roster and Salary: After the trade and signing of Gabriel, the team salary has exceeded the Super-Tax Apron. However, some restrictions and penalties will not take effect until next year, so it depends on how much the owner is willing to pay for the luxury tax this year. The Celtics now have four players with salaries in the 30 million range, and the depth of the bench has decreased compared to last year.</p> <p>Team Salary: 1. Jrue Holiday - $36,861,7072. Kristaps Porzingis - $36,016,2003. Jayson Tatum - $32,600,0604. Jaylen Brown - $31,830,3575. Derrick White - $18,357,1436. Al Horford - $10,000,0007. Payton Pritchard - $4,037,2788. Luke Kornet - $2,413,304 (non-guaranteed)9. Oshae Brissett - $2,165,00010. Svi Mykhailiuk - $2,019,706 (non-guaranteed)11. Dalano Banton - $2,019,706 (non-guaranteed)12. Sam Hauser - $1,927,89613. Jordan Walsh - $1,119,563-------------------------------------------------- ------The total salary of these 13 players\u300b$181,367,9202023 Super-Tax Apron\u300b$182,794,00-------------------------------------------------- ------The total salary of these thirteen players is only 1.4M away from the Super-Tax Apron. Even a minimum salary space is not enough. Basically, unless the team decompresses players through trades, it will inevitably exceed the Super-Tax Apron. This is also the reason why I don't think it's like Stevens. According to the owner Wyc's past style, even if he gives the green light, he may not do it to this extent. Everyone understands that the window for winning the championship is fleeting, but the risk is still too great to do this. From Brown's contract extension to the KP trade, I still believe that the team is willing to make changes while considering the depth of the team. Is it really because of the Bucks' reinforcement that they feel a sense of crisis? It's worth everyone to think about.</p> <p>Team Roster: The team can bring 20 players into training camp. Currently, in addition to 13 formal contracts, the three two-way contracts have also been confirmed. The remaining four training camp contracts will determine the remaining player positions. Currently, the team has signed three training camp contracts, L. Stevens, W. Gabriel, and K. Kelley. The first two are Exhibit 9 contracts, and the latter is an Exhibit 10 contract. It is expected that the remaining player positions will be filled by the first two.</p> <p>The preseason training camp has already begun, so there may not be any more signings of training camp contracts. In order to maintain the flexibility of the roster, only one of the two will probably be chosen to fill the 14th player position. Originally, I would have chosen Stevens without hesitation, but now that there is a gap in the frontcourt, Gabriel has an advantage. However, I don't think he can have much impact on defense in the frontcourt. I would rather believe in Kornet's abilities.</p> <p>Impact of M.Brogdon &amp; R.Williams III leaving: Although Brogdon won the Sixth Man of the Year award last year, and he is indeed an efficient scorer, his stability on the court and ability to make the right decisions are important assets for the bench.</p> <p>But he didn't perform as well in organization as others expected. Of course, it's not all his fault. He is able to organize the offense through pick and rolls, but this is not the Celtics' usual tactic, nor is it the most efficient tactic. For me, Brogdon's better performance is his cutting and three-point shooting. His cutting speed and finishing may not have many tricks, but his dribble penetration is sharp, and his three-point shooting is at the top level in the league. With his position and salary, we can't ask for more, but he won't be the one to take the ball in crucial moments and command the offense like everyone expects.</p> <p>As for Williams III, that is the key reason why I don't agree with this trade. First of all, he has a three-year contract with an average of only 12M, which is definitely not a player who will be restricted by salary. Secondly, he finally established his value in the previous season. Although he had surgery on his meniscus, he still had a huge impact on defense in the frontcourt. Not to mention his potential in playmaking and outside shooting. I don't think his injury is the reason why the team sent him away so soon.</p> <p>Especially with the arrival of Porzingis, it is obvious that Horford will have to take a step back, allowing Williams III to reduce his burden and exert his defensive ability. Now, after Horford, there is no one who can handle the frontcourt.</p> <p>Finally, it's about the Celtics' salary space. I think it's because the owner doesn't want to pay that extra 1.4M in luxury tax, so they decided to send Williams III away as soon as possible. However, I also have a final question, why choose to send Williams III instead of Payton Pritchard? Perhaps it's because Pritchard is still part of the team's plans, but Williams III is not, so they chose to send him away.</p> <p>In conclusion, this trade is a huge change for the Celtics. The team's roster and salary space have been affected, which has left fans with doubts and concerns. Hopefully, this trade will bring stability and success to the team, and we can look forward to the upcoming new season.</p>"},{"location":"20231015091150343374/","title":"Datome\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u300c\u6211\u5f88\u69ae\u5e78\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u9019\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u8207\u4f60\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u5954\u8dd1\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u96e3\u5fd8\u7684\u591c\u665a\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u611f\u8b1d\u6bcf\u500b\u4eba\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ea\u662f\u6211\u7684\u968a\u53cb\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u6211\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u3002\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u65c5\u7a0b\uff0c\u6211\u5f88\u611f\u6fc0\u6bcf\u500b\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u6703\u6c38\u9060\u8a18\u5f97\u9019\u4e9b\u6642\u523b\u3002\u300d","text":"<p>Datome\u4e5f\u611f\u8b1d\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u66fe\u7d93\u6559\u5c0e\u904e\u4ed6\u7684\u6559\u7df4\uff0c\u4ed6\u8aaa\uff1a\u300c\u6211\u60f3\u611f\u8b1d\u6240\u6709\u66fe\u7d93\u6559\u5c0e\u904e\u6211\u7684\u6559\u7df4\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u5e6b\u52a9\u4e86\u6211\uff0c\u8b93\u6211\u6210\u70ba\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u6211\u3002\u6211\u5c07\u6c38\u9060\u611f\u8b1d\u4ed6\u5011\u3002\u300d</p> <p>\u5728\u6700\u5f8c\uff0cDatome\u4e5f\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u8aaa\uff1a\u300c\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u611f\u8b1d\u6211\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4e00\u76f4\u652f\u6301\u6211\uff0c\u662f\u4ed6\u5011\u8b93\u6211\u6210\u70ba\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u6211\u3002\u6211\u611f\u6fc0\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u611b\u548c\u652f\u6301\u3002\u300d</p> <p>Luigi Datome\u7684\u9000\u5f79\uff0c\u610f\u5473\u8457\u7fa9\u5927\u5229\u7537\u7c43\u5c07\u5931\u53bb\u4e00\u4f4d\u5049\u5927\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u7684\u50b3\u5947\u5c07\u6703\u6c38\u9060\u7559\u5728\u4eba\u5011\u7684\u5fc3\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u795d\u798fDatome\u5728\u9000\u5f79\u5f8c\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u4e00\u5207\u9806\u5229\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4ed6\u80fd\u5920\u4eab\u53d7\u5c6c\u65bc\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u500b\u7bc7\u7ae0\u3002    Datome\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u300c\u6211\u5f88\u69ae\u5e78\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u9019\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u8207\u4f60\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u5954\u8dd1\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u96e3\u5fd8\u7684\u591c\u665a\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u611f\u8b1d\u6bcf\u500b\u4eba\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ea\u662f\u6211\u7684\u968a\u53cb\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u6211\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u3002\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u65c5\u7a0b\uff0c\u6211\u5f88\u611f\u6fc0\u6bcf\u500b\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u6703\u6c38\u9060\u8a18\u5f97\u9019\u4e9b\u6642\u523b\u3002\u300d</p> <p>Datome\u4e5f\u611f\u8b1d\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u66fe\u7d93\u6559\u5c0e\u904e\u4ed6\u7684\u6559\u7df4\uff0c\u4ed6\u8aaa\uff1a\u300c\u6211\u60f3\u611f\u8b1d\u6240\u6709\u66fe\u7d93\u6559\u5c0e\u904e\u6211\u7684\u6559\u7df4\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u5e6b\u52a9\u4e86\u6211\uff0c\u8b93\u6211\u6210\u70ba\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u6211\u3002\u6211\u5c07\u6c38\u9060\u611f\u8b1d\u4ed6\u5011\u3002\u300d</p> <p>\u5728\u6700\u5f8c\uff0cDatome\u4e5f\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u8aaa\uff1a\u300c\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u611f\u8b1d\u6211\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4e00\u76f4\u652f\u6301\u6211\uff0c\u662f\u4ed6\u5011\u8b93\u6211\u6210\u70ba\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u6211\u3002\u6211\u611f\u6fc0\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u611b\u548c\u652f\u6301\u3002\u300d</p> <p>Luigi Datome\u7684\u9000\u5f79\uff0c\u610f\u5473\u8457\u7fa9\u5927\u5229\u7537\u7c43\u5c07\u5931\u53bb\u4e00\u4f4d\u5049\u5927\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u7684\u50b3\u5947\u5c07\u6703\u6c38\u9060\u7559\u5728\u4eba\u5011\u7684\u5fc3\u4e2d\u3002\u6211\u5011\u795d\u798fDatome\u5728\u9000\u5f79\u5f8c\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u4e00\u5207\u9806\u5229\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4ed6\u80fd\u5920\u4eab\u53d7\u5c6c\u65bc\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u500b\u7bc7\u7ae0\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231015091154587841/","title":"PLG Dreamers to Host Dream Link Exchange Tournament with Five Teams Competing at Mini Egg Fantasy","text":"<p>The PLG Dreamers announced today (18) that they will gather two league teams to hold the \"Dream Link\" exchange tournament    PLG Dreamers to Host Dream Link Exchange Tournament with Five Teams Competing at Mini Egg Fantasy</p> <p>The PLG Dreamers announced today (18) that they will gather two league teams to hold the \"Dream Link\" exchange tournament.

Let's discuss what can be improved and what was done well in this game. Just like I mentioned in my previous article, three-point shots will determine the key in this game.</p> <p>Today, China's three-point shooting percentage was as high as 45%, while the Chinese team's percentage was also around 35%. However, unfortunately, the opponent's three-point shooting was just too accurate, with many shots being made even with good defense.</p> <p>Our own three-point shots were not taken advantage of well, which resulted in the score being pulled apart. The second issue is rebounding, as it is a well-known fact that China's team has a height advantage over the Chinese team.</p> <p>So, how to protect our own rebounds is something the coaching staff needs to consider. However, in today's game, there were many rebounds that were not protected well, and there were also some unlucky situations where the ball bounced in the opposite direction and was picked up by the Chinese team.</p> <p>Also, our power forwards saw opportunities for fast breaks when the opponent took a shot, which should be the team's strategy to play fast and high. But if rebounds are not grabbed, fast breaks cannot be formed.</p> <p>In addition, the handling of fast breaks was not good in today's game, with hesitation and rushing at times. So, how to adjust fast breaks when facing taller opponents will also be a challenge for the Chinese team. The third issue is the lack of a pure point guard on the team. With Chen Yingjun's injury, it was very obvious today that China's team constantly pressured and marked our backcourt, making it difficult for us to pass the ball easily.</p> <p>This resulted in a lack of smoothness in our offense, which is also something the Chinese team needs to think about. The fourth issue is the defensive lapses. In the third quarter, we could clearly see that China's team scored two consecutive backdoor baskets. In the fourth quarter, there were also open shots for the opponent, but our defenders did not go up to defend.</p> <p>Perhaps it was due to fatigue or other factors, but this is something that needs to be improved. The fifth issue is when a player goes cold, it causes a lot of trouble for the Chinese team. This is something the coaching staff needs to think about, whether to substitute a player when they are not performing well. If not, should the focus of the offense be shifted to other players on the court? Everyone has bad days, but how to still have an impact during those times is the key for players. Today, we could see that Liu Zheng was not in good form, but he still did a lot of defensive tasks on the court, which had a huge impact.</p> <p>But if we substitute in other young players, can they still provide this defensive energy when they are not in good form? This is something worth observing. Now, let's talk about the good things the Chinese team did today. First, we need to praise Hao Tianyou, who performed really well today, with a score of 20+10.</p> <p>He can play one-on-one against his opponent on offense and effectively limit the opponent's attack on defense. Simply put, Hao Tianyou played basketball with his heart and soul, and we can't ask for more from him. But we need him to maintain this level of performance, and hopefully, he can continue to play like this in the upcoming games. The second person to praise is Zeng Wending, who once again played at the level of an interior player.</p> <p>He shoots when he has an open shot and creates opportunities for himself and works hard on the interior. Zeng Wending does all of this perfectly, and as long as he is on the Chinese team's interior, there is still a chance to win.</p> <p>The third person who did well is Abasi. But I have to say, in my opinion, Abasi's performance today was not that great, with too many turnovers and unwise passes.</p> <p>(Because my expectations for him are higher, he should perform better) However, Abasi's scoring ability is something we can see, and he can still use his strong physical attributes on both offense and defense to gain an advantage. Today, Abasi scored 16 points, and I hope he can maintain this firepower and reduce turnovers, so the Chinese team can have more room for adjustments.</p> <p>Lastly, we need to praise Lin Tingqian, who maintained a high level of performance despite China's team putting a lot of pressure on our backcourt. His overall performance was very stable.</p> <p>But in the upcoming games, he will need to unleash his firepower, and it will depend on how the coaching staff adjusts the personnel on the court.</p> <p>The three shooters in the Chinese team's backcourt, Lin Tingqian, Abasi, and Liu Zheng, need to have at least two of them firing in each game. Today, there was a situation where one and a half shooters were cold, which resulted in a lack of scoring power. I hope these three players can maintain their good form, so the pressure on the Chinese team's interior can be relieved.</p> <p>Lastly, I want to say that the Chinese team's performance today was not bad. Although we lost to China, we also saw many areas for improvement, which is also a valuable experience in the Asian Games.</p> <p>I hope the Chinese team can bounce back in the upcoming games and show our true strength. But we must remind ourselves not to give up just because we lost one game. We need to face the upcoming games with a positive attitude, continue to fight, and believe that the Chinese men's basketball team will have a better performance!</p>"},{"location":"20231015091212750362/","title":"Observation of the Hangzhou Asian Games: Chinese men's basketball team's dismal three-point performance and bumpy collaboration lead to a narrow victory over Mongolia to advance to the top 12","text":"<p>Observation of the Hangzhou Asian Games: Chinese men's basketball team's dismal three-point performance and bumpy collaboration lead to a narrow victory over Mongolia to advance to the top 12.</p> <p>At halftime, Mongolia surprisingly led by one point, leaving the entire team puzzled. The overall strength of the Chinese men's basketball team was clearly much higher than their own, yet they started the game in such a low state, which must have left their path to the top in a state of uncertainty.</p> <p>Key players for the Chinese team included Abasi with 18 points and 6 rebounds, Atno with 27 points and 8 rebounds, and Zeng Wendong with 6 assists and 3 rebounds, with a plus-minus value of +14. Putting aside the coaching staff, there are a few players who did not meet the national team's level of play. The first is Li Dewei, who has not been able to perform in the Asian Games stage as he did in his club team. He failed to create enough space off the ball and his poor defense allowed opponents to easily get past him. His usual high post strategy also resulted in frequent turnovers.</p> <p>The second player is Li Qiwei, who is known as a 3&amp;D player, which is exactly what the Chinese team lacks. He was supposed to lock down the opponents' backcourt, but more often than not, he was easily beaten by their guards. His inability to make open three-point shots was a major disrespect to the coach who gave him playing time.</p> <p>The third player is Lu Junxiang, who has proven during his time with the Fubon Braves that he is not a player who can handle the ball well. However, the coach did not come up with effective tactics for him to score, making him a dispensable player. His weak help defense and switching concept made him seem like a headless fly on the court, which is a result of conflicts between the coach's system-building and player selection.</p> <p>Lastly, the coaching staff. In a short-term international tournament, the coach should choose players who are in good form to play. However, it seemed like the coaches were giving the players time to warm up and hoping they would improve throughout the game. This resulted in a close victory against a team with a large gap in strength. The coaching staff should be quicker in their response to situations, and if the 6 minutes of playing time given to Li Qiwei had been given to Xie Yaxun, it would have been more beneficial for the team's offense. Xie's ability to score immediately after coming on the court would have made him a priority player. Therefore, the coaching staff was also one of the main reasons for the chaos in the final group game. There was no clear defensive focus throughout the game, such as which player to limit or how to switch and defend in different areas. This lack of defensive communication allowed the opponents to easily cut to the free-throw line for easy scoring opportunities or to draw a foul. These defensive weaknesses were not corrected in time, and they will likely reappear in the next game against Kazakhstan. It will be up to the coaching staff to respond quickly, otherwise the team will have a hard time on both ends of the court.</p> <p>Continuing with the offensive capabilities of the team, it is clear that all the scorers need to contribute. Liu Zheng, Lu Junxiang, Xie Yaxun, Wu Yongsheng, and Lin Tingqian are all primarily scorers. From today's game, it is evident that Abasi has once again proven himself as the team's top scorer. Not to mention how poorly he was able to handle the ball against the Chinese team, his physicality allowed him to draw fouls and score from the paint, and his first-line defense was crucial for the team. Fortunately, he carried the team in scoring and rebounding in the second half, or else the team would have only made 5 three-pointers with a 26% shooting percentage, compared to Mongolia's 38% shooting percentage with 11 made three-pointers out of 29 attempts.</p> <p>This is also the key factor that allowed Mongolia to lead and keep the game close. Luckily, their last three-point attempt did not go in, or else the game would have gone into overtime and the outcome would have been uncertain.</p> <p>However, I would like to thank Lin Tingqian for taking on the heavy responsibility of controlling the ball. Without him, the team's scorers would have been useless. He also sacrificed his own scoring abilities. In this game, he hit a crucial corner three-pointer, which made up for his previous offensive mistakes. In the upcoming game against Kazakhstan, the main challenge will be dealing with their five two-meter tall players. Regardless of their skill level, the Chinese men's basketball team's lack of height means they will have a hard time relying on speed. With the current poor three-point shooting performance, their chances of winning are slim. If they can improve their three-point shooting to a 35% shooting percentage with at least 10 made three-pointers, they might have a chance against Kazakhstan.</p> <p>Personally, I hope to see the Chinese team run smoothly, with fast breaks leading to layups and a 50% three-point shooting percentage. Then, it will be possible to give Xie Yaxun more playing time. It is clear that the Xinjiang Flying Tigers do not need much dribbling to create open shots, but instead rely on cutting and off-ball movement to create space. This is a display of teamwork and also shows the value of Zeng Wendong, who is still a role model for Taiwanese big men. Unfortunately, due to his age, he cannot stay on the court for long periods of time.

In this article, the author will not only explore the hottest topics, such as Edwards' rise, the collaboration of the Twin Towers, and the team's reinforcements and strategies for the new season, but also discuss the additions and departures of players. (In) Shake Milton (In) Troy Brown Jr. (In) Daishen Nix (In) Leonard Miller (Out) Taurean Prince (Out) Austin Rivers (Out) Jaylen Nowell (Out) Bryn Forbes Hey, you're here. Keep reading. (In) This season, there is ample room for the main team to familiarize themselves with each other.</p> <p>The Timberwolves ranked 23rd in offensive efficiency in the league this season, but their defensive efficiency was in the top 10.</p> <p>New addition Gobert was not able to fully adapt to D'Angelo Russell's passes, leading to fluctuations in offensive efficiency. In addition, Towns' absence due to injury for a third of the season inevitably resulted in a decline in offensive efficiency.</p> <p>Although Towns is often criticized for being a soft center, his offensive contributions are crucial to the team's tactics. His outside shooting creates more space for the team's offense and is especially useful in fast breaks.</p> <p>However, Towns' three-point shooting has been inconsistent, and the Twin Towers experiment has made it difficult for the two centers to coexist, resulting in some confusion in their previously emphasized fast-paced, space-spreading playstyle. However, as the season progressed, Conley and Gobert's chemistry from their time with the Jazz resurfaced, Edwards could explode on offense at any moment, and the stellar performance of the \"third tower\" Naz Reid all showed that while there is still room for improvement in their offensive performance, the team's early season instability has become more stable.</p> <p>Relying on other players' defense Despite the criticism of moving Towns to the power forward position, the previous management hoped that Gobert could make up for his defensive shortcomings, but Gobert's underestimated rim-protecting ability was showcased in the play-in tournament and playoffs. For example, in a game against the Thunder, the collaboration between Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Gobert limited their opponent's star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's mid-range scoring and passing abilities.</p> <p>In their matchup against the Nuggets, Gobert's defense against Jokic was extremely difficult, limiting their opponent's performance and shooting efficiency.</p> <p>In addition, starting players Edwards, McDaniels, and bench players Kyle Anderson, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and Taurean Prince all have the size and lateral quickness to play multiple positions on defense, showing that the Timberwolves have a solid foundation on defense.</p> <p>Therefore, the improvement in the Timberwolves' performance in last season's playoffs (especially on defense) shows the potential for progress.</p> <p>This season's weakness The Timberwolves' biggest problem is their \"twin towers\" partnership, which was seen in last season's inability to complement each other and will directly affect the team's future development. Even in this preseason, they are still trying to play Towns and Reid at the power forward position and Gobert at the center position in their \"twin towers\" experiment. While it may seem like there has been some improvement on the offensive end, their lack of lateral quickness on defense compared to traditional power forwards is evident in their individual defense, help defense, and closeouts. Even if the defense at other positions is outstanding, a small hole can lead to overall defensive breakdowns. On the offensive end, with Reid and Gobert on the court at the same time, they are limited to being shooters, not being able to fully utilize their potential.</p> <p>The idealized effect of the Twin Towers may seem great, but it is difficult to achieve in reality. As the team continues to grow and develop, the collaboration and future of the Twin Towers will be the most important factor to consider.</p> <p>Key variable The Timberwolves' biggest challenge is the collaboration of the \"twin towers.\" Last season, their partnership was not effective, and this will directly impact the team's future development.</p> <p>Even in this preseason, they are still attempting to play Towns and Reid at the power forward position and Gobert at the center position in their \"twin towers\" experiment. While there has been some improvement on the offensive end, their lack of lateral quickness compared to traditional power forwards is evident in their individual defense, help defense, and closeouts.</p> <p>Even if the defense at other positions is outstanding, a small hole can lead to overall defensive breakdowns.

As the team continues to grow and develop, the partnership and future of the Twin Towers will be the most important factor to consider.</p> <p>Conclusion Despite facing setbacks in last season's playoffs, the Timberwolves' future in the new season is still full of hope. The rise of rookie Edwards and the collaboration of the Twin Towers will continue to be crucial for the team's future. Additionally, there is room for improvement in the team's reinforcements and strategies.</p> <p>However, the collaboration of the Twin Towers remains the team's biggest challenge, and it will impact their future development. Only by solving this problem can the Timberwolves achieve greater success in the new season.</p>"},{"location":"20231015091253126592/","title":"New Orleans Pelicans forward Trey Murphy suffered a meniscus injury during a scrimmage on Wednesday and immediately underwent evaluation and treatment","text":"<p>New Orleans Pelicans forward Trey Murphy suffered a meniscus injury during a scrimmage on Wednesday and immediately underwent evaluation and treatment.

Since then, he has only returned once, but in a way, he never really left. </p> <p>Engelland is now the shooting coach for the USA team in this year's World Cup. He is not surprised to see fans recognizing him on the sidelines, as he has experienced being approached by Filipino-Americans for photos even in the US. \"If that happens in the US, I can only imagine how many people would recognize me in the Philippines,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I haven't played on a court in almost 40 years, yet I can still be recognized in the US. Filipino fans are truly amazing. I've met some passionate fans in Las Vegas and we sat down to chat, talking about the PBA and our beloved country,\" Engelland shares. This also shows the lasting impact he has left in the Filipino basketball community. </p> <p>Engelland is arguably the best pure shooter in the history of the PBA. After graduating from Duke University, he played in 76 games and averaged 27.5 points per game, with a record high of 60 points. He was also known as the \"Machine Gun\" for his precise shooting. </p> <p>Engelland was also a member of the famous Northern Consolidated Corporation (NCC) in the 1980s. NCC was a team formed by Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco, who was appointed by then President Ferdinand E. Marcos as the director of the national team. The team was put together to represent the Philippines in international competitions. </p> <p>After training together for a few months, NCC, essentially a club team not affiliated with any league, had four naturalized players, including Engelland. They helped the Philippines secure a fourth-place finish in the 1982 Asian Games and won the 1985 Asian Championship in Kuala Lumpur, earning them a spot in the 1986 FIBA World Cup in Spain. </p> <p>In 1985, NCC also won the William Jones Cup, with Engelland scoring 43 points against the Purdue University team representing the US. \"Without Jeff Moore and Dennis Still, we wouldn't have won the Jones Cup,\" he says. \"We were a well-rounded team with great chemistry, and we still keep in touch.\" These achievements are still celebrated by Filipinos and Filipino-Americans, as basketball is the national sport of the Philippines. \"Our performance in international competitions showcased our basketball prowess to many fans,\" Engelland adds. </p> <p>After the end of NCC in 1986, Engelland returned to the US and played in minor leagues before retiring and transitioning to a shooting coach. He held camps and worked as a private training consultant for players, earning him the nickname \"The Shooting Doctor.\" Current US team head coach Steve Kerr and general manager Grant Hill were once his clients. In the 1999-2000 season, Engelland joined the Detroit Pistons as a shooting coach assistant, and three years later, he became the director of player development for the Denver Nuggets. He then spent 17 years with the San Antonio Spurs as an assistant coach, helping them win two championships. Players like Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, and Dejounte Murray all broke through their ceilings under his guidance and are now considered some of the best in the NBA. </p> <p>Kerr had been trying to recruit Engelland as a shooting coach for the Golden State Warriors, but their collaboration finally happened in the national team. Engelland is now a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder, tasked with developing talented young players like Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams, as well as current Canadian and Australian national team players, and Thunder's rising stars Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey. Giddey has praised Engelland's coaching, saying, \"I train with him 2-3 times a day almost every day since he joined us. He's a genius.\" Engelland also mentions his two proteges, saying, \"With SGA and Josh, Canada and Australia will definitely be tough opponents for us. They have already proven themselves in the NBA.\" </p> <p>Engelland last visited the Philippines 17 years ago, but only for a few days. Now, he is trying to reacquaint himself with the city he once called home. \"I can't recognize many places anymore. I can still recognize some people and things, but I had to find new landmarks to move around. But I'm enjoying my stay here,\" he shares. Due to a busy schedule, he hasn't had much chance to watch the current Philippine national team play, but he knows they have a lot of promising young players. \"I know they have a lot of young players, and I know they are consciously training them.

Mazzulla's response was, \"Lillard is a strong player and the Bucks are a strong team, but I don't have time to worry about these things.\"</p> <p>Mazzulla quickly explained his reasoning behind this answer, saying, \"Last year as a rookie head coach, I really wanted to secure the first seed in the regular season.

If we were the first seed and got eliminated by the eighth seed, I might not even be sitting here.\" Redick then jokingly interjected, \"I don't want to pour cold water on you, but you did lose to the eighth seed.\" Mazzulla clarified, \"I meant losing in the first round.\" The two then laughed together, showing how much they enjoyed this conversation.</p> <p>Mazzulla concluded the topic by saying, \"Last year, what really taught me was that things can develop and change very quickly. I don't need to worry about so many things. That would only make me lose sight of the things we can actually see and control.\" He added, \"If I worry too much about the Bucks, it will not only harm our players, but also affect the efficiency of the team.

Even in their own country, it was not expected that they would have such a performance this year before the final roster was announced.</p> <p>Now, let's get to know Lithuania, the Eastern European team that has performed remarkably in this year's World Cup.</p> <p>Please continue reading \"Who is Next?\" This is the reaction of Lithuania's number one star, Jonas Valanciunas, to the resignation of former assistant coach Kestutis Kemzura on the BasketNews Instagram account a few weeks before the start of training camp. Valanciunas has not missed a single major FIBA tournament in the past 16 years. Therefore, when another teammate chose not to attend the national team training camp, he expressed his frustration. Lithuania could have formed a team with all the top players, but players like Domantas Sabonis, Marius Grigonis, Rokas Giedraitis, Edgaras Ulanovas, Arnas Butkevicius, Lukas Lekavicius and Arturas Gudaitis all refused to represent Lithuania for various reasons in the World Cup.</p> <p>However, the remaining players have become a perfect example that big-name players do not always guarantee the best results, and vice versa. Despite the disappointment of Sabonis, one of Lithuania's top players, choosing not to participate in the World Cup, it also relieved head coach Kazys Maksvytis to some extent.</p> <p>He no longer has to worry about how to make Valanciunas and Sabonis cooperate on the court, as no coach has been able to successfully make these two NBA players fit together, which has been proven many times in previous international competitions. Valanciunas became the main low-post threat in the team, ensuring scoring in the paint. In the World Cup, he performed as expected, scoring 14.5 points (shooting 69.2% from two-point range), 11 rebounds, and 1.5 assists, with a very impressive efficiency. He also made it to the All-Tournament Second Team after the Cup ended.</p> <p>Photo source: Getty Images With many veterans withdrawing from the national team, Rokas Jokubaitis realized that the primary ball-handling task would fall on his shoulders.</p> <p>Please continue reading before the World Cup, the 22-year-old Jokubaitis did not fully live up to the expectations and potential that had been placed on him in the past few years.</p> <p>He also encountered difficulties in the first game against Egypt in the World Cup, scoring only 2 points and going 0 for 6 from the field, and committing three turnovers.</p> <p>However, he bounced back like an experienced star in the following games. In the three games against Mexico, Montenegro, and Greece, Jokubaitis averaged 17.7 points, 2.7 rebounds and 6.3 assists, with an efficiency score of 23.3. In addition, his three-point shooting was also impressive, making 8 out of 7 shots.</p> <p>Despite being only 22 years old, he is also one of the youngest starting point guards in this tournament, but his teammates appreciate his ability to control the game and direct the offense. \"When I think back to my performance and decision-making at his age, I can only give him a lot of praise because he can effectively handle the high-level challenges he faces. He knows clearly that if he doesn't perform well, we may face a difficult game. He struggled in the first game, just like last year. But he quickly learned from his mistakes and made progress.\" Mindaugas Kuzminskas said. With Marius Grigonis withdrawing, Ignas Brazdeikis became the only true scorer who can solve problems in critical moments, especially when Lithuania needs a last-minute one-on-one solution.</p> <p>Teammates noticed that Brazdeikis doesn't like to force his way to the basket, but rather reads the situation and is willing to share the ball, unlike last year.</p> <p>The current Brazdeikis is averaging 11.5 points, shooting an impressive 54.5% from two-point range and 70% from three-point range. He also contributes with an average of 4.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game.</p> <p>His turnovers have decreased from 2.2 in the last European Basketball Championship to 1.0 in the World Cup, and his shooting percentage has increased by a surprising 20.7%.</p> <p>The other players around this core team have also shown their professional strengths, whether as defensive specialists or versatile veterans, and their team's success always takes precedence over personal ambitions.</p> <p>For example, former New York Knick Mindaugas Kuzminskas was barely in the rotation in the 2019 World Cup and 2021 Olympic qualifying matches.</p> <p>However, under the guidance of Kazys Maksvytis, he successfully regained his confidence and returned to his normal performance.</p> <p>As a 33-year-old veteran, Kuzminskas performed well in the World Cup, averaging 10.8 points, 5.0 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game, shooting 75% from two-point range and 46.2% from three-point range. He can also make key shots in crucial moments of the game.</p> <p>This is the danger factor of Lithuania. They do not rely on any one player, but rather on the overall performance of the team. Their players can complement each other, trust each other, and are willing to sacrifice personal interests to play for the national team. Their team spirit and selfless dedication make them a formidable dark horse team.</p>"},{"location":"20231017091206590900/","title":"The intense trade rumors surrounding NBA stars Damian Lillard of the Trail Blazers and James Harden of the 76ers have once again sparked the NBA preseason","text":"<p>The intense trade rumors surrounding NBA stars Damian Lillard of the Trail Blazers and James Harden of the 76ers have once again sparked the NBA preseason. I discussed in detail in July about Lillard's situation.</p> <p>In conclusion, Lillard will continue to fly for a while, and the team is in a favorable position. A recap of the previous situation: [NBA] Lillard, the final piece of the puzzle for the Heat's championship? Apart from these off-court factors, the key to whether the two sides can ultimately part ways amicably is how much the Heat can offer in terms of first-round draft picks and players that fit the Blazers' rebuilding strategy (such as Tyler Herro); a single trade is difficult, so the Bulls, 76ers, or Nets are likely to be involved in a three-way trade.</p> <p>Time is on the team's side, and unless there are unexpected changes, Lillard will continue to fly for a while! Two months have passed, and the situation hasn't changed much. The only difference is that the preseason is approaching and the rosters of each team will be mostly set.</p> <p>For the Blazers, Lillard, and the Heat, this is a time to increase pressure or test each other again. Therefore, there have been more rumors recently. Such as (1) the Heat's Nikola Jovic played well in the World Cup and the Blazers would agree to a trade if the Heat are willing to let him go.</p> <p>(2) Lillard only wants to stay with the Blazers or go to the Heat's training camp. Other teams are unwilling, but then suddenly all teams are willing. (3) There are even reports from reporters who have long been covering the Blazers that Lillard was tricked by Blazers' GM Joe Cronin and is unhappy, so he insists on going to the Heat.</p> <p>Or (4) league chairman Adam Silver called on professional players to respect the spirit of their contracts, and the league is not happy to see players demand trades all the time. Please continue reading for a brief discussion on Jovic. The biggest obstacle to Lillard's trade is not Jovic, but what \"main dish\" the Heat can offer. As for the highly anticipated Jovic, he left the second summer league game with discomfort in his left foot and has been sidelined since. Although he has been aggressive on the offensive end, his post moves are still a bit stiff, and his performance in transition is slightly better. His progress is not very obvious, and he is not at the level of a championship team's role player. We will see a clearer picture during the preseason. [NBA] Lillard, the final piece of the puzzle for the Heat's championship? Based on the previous reported trade packages, the Heat should be prepared to give up this year's first-round pick Jaime Jaquez Jr. or wingman Caleb Martin, so why not Jovic? After all, compared to directly competing for the championship, the aforementioned losses are not worth mentioning.</p> <p>If the Blazers let go of Lillard, it means they have officially entered the rebuilding phase. To efficiently rebuild, they should aim for a large number of first-round picks or young and affordable potential rookies.</p> <p>Please continue reading for more information on the trade salary cap and why the Heat's trade is just a last resort. If the Heat can offer a young big man who fits the Blazers' needs and has a good trajectory, they may be able to give up a few first-round picks.</p> <p>It seems that hero-Tyler Herro is not on the Blazers' radar (I personally think he is good, but the Blazers' management may have a different opinion), so if the Heat wants to get a deal done quickly, they need to find a third or fourth team to facilitate a multi-team trade.</p> <p>This is why there were previous rumors of the Bulls' Zach LaVine, the 76ers' James Harden, and even the Nets, and now the latest one is the Thunder.</p> <p>The rest of the rumors or statements are just small talk and will not have any impact on the essence of the negotiations between the two sides. The Blazers' third overall pick Scoot Henderson is ready to take over the point guard position in the backcourt. Time is still on the Blazers' side.</p> <p>The Heat want to make a deal as soon as possible, they must offer an irresistible offer, and if they can't cook it themselves, they can order takeout. If they can't do either, they can forget about getting a five-star rating from Michelin.

With the handover of the golden generation, the growth of the new generation players has become the focus of attention for fans. One of the rising stars in Taiwanese basketball is Yi-Zhe You, who dominated the small giant egg from high school to college.</p> <p>Basketball was introduced to Yi-Zhe You in high school and it has become a part of his life since then.</p> <p>He used to follow his family to the tribal court, where he not only enjoyed the joy of running, but also the excitement of scoring. \"Now I feel that basketball has brought me a lot of gains. The feeling on the court is that if I do something well, I can get a sense of accomplishment from it.\" Yi-Zhe You said, \"The game is constantly changing, and I imagine the result of every play. If I can send the ball to where I want it to be, I will feel happy and excited, and I think this feeling is really great.\"</p> <p>In junior high school, Yi-Zhe You participated in a basketball team similar to a \"basketball club\". He saw playing basketball as entertainment and did not feel too much pressure.</p> <p>Later, through the introduction of relatives, he came to Nan Ren High School to challenge the top group: \"With the environment of Nan Ren and the help of senior students at that time, I felt very comfortable there. I also learned that Nan Ren is a school that is good at cultivating guards, and I wanted to challenge myself by coming here to play.\" In his second year of high school, he suffered a serious metatarsal fracture. \"At that time, I was very depressed because it was the first time I encountered such an injury.</p> <p>I went home and rested for a while, and I also communicated with my family at that time, because I didn't play well in the first year and suffered injuries in the second year. There was a slight thought of giving up.</p> <p>But my family has always given me strength to keep going. The coaching team of Nan Ren also did not give up on me. Coach Cheng-Ming Lin always put me in the position, and I didn't want to let them down, and I didn't want them to regret making this decision. I wanted to prove that although I didn't play well in the first and second years, I still have the ability to lead the team in the third year.\"</p> <p>It wasn't until his third year that Yi-Zhe You's efforts paid off. \"This year is extraordinary for me. It is a turning point in my life. It is also because of this year that I have played some fame and made many people know me. I also try my best to contribute everything I have learned on the court and let everyone see me. I also have a lot of confidence in myself this year. I know that I have the ability to perform well, but I also understand that it is the coaching team's cultivation that allows me to have such performance.\" After three consecutive championships at Cheng Chi University, he became the first controller of UBA. During his college years, Yi-Zhe You chose to study communication at National Chengchi University. \"Brother Yan-Ting entered the College of Communication when he first came here. He shared some experiences with me. I also wanted to follow him. After I came here, I was more adaptable.</p> <p>In these three years, I have learned a lot, not only in class, but also in interpersonal relationships. I have gained a lot from the literary atmosphere of Cheng Chi University. When I came here, I became more comfortable.\" Many players will encounter \"self-management\" when they go from high school to college. When talking about the biggest difference between college and high school, Yi-Zhe You said: \"We don't have a schedule for sports classes. In high school, the coach will take care of everything. When I came to college, there were a lot of free time, so I really have to do better in time management.\" His self-discipline helped him to adapt to the intensity of UBA after he went to college, and he won the Newcomer King, Assist King, and Steal King in his first year, and won the first UBA championship. What was the experience of Yi-Zhe You? \"That year was the most tiring year for me in these three years. I don't know if I was adapting to the intensity of UBA at the time, but Coach Tzu-Wei always gave me opportunities and was willing to believe in me and let me take on this responsibility in my first year. He also let me play well in tactical configuration.</p> <p>I was really happy that year. I can win the championship with my seniors and let me know that winning the championship is really not easy.\"</p> <p>In his second and third year, Yi-Zhe You won the Assist King and Steal King all the way, and also completed three consecutive championships. When it comes to the different championships, Yi-Zhe You revealed: \"I think these two years are a process, and gradually I have to become a leader from a younger brother. In my first and second year, I just followed the seniors step by step, but when I faced key moments in my third year, I realized that I had to stand up and take responsibility.</p> <p>The two championships in my second and third years felt about the same, which was to achieve a phased goal.\" However, as a player at Cheng Chi University, he must balance academics and basketball skills. After sweating and training, he must rush to class and take care of his appearance. Yi-Zhe You relies on the Men's Research Amino Acid Facial Cleanser to combat the oily skin after training. When talking about how to maintain a refreshing appearance after training, Yi-Zhe You revealed his secret weapon to us: \"Usually after playing basketball, I feel that washing my face is not clean, but after washing my face, I feel dry and tight, and then I get oily quickly.\"</p> <p>\"After using the Men's Research Amino Acid Facial Cleanser, the overall feeling is not dry, and the feeling is very clean and smart. After washing, my face won't be slippery, and the oily condition will also improve.\" Yi-Zhe You added, \"After training, if you have to go to class or have a team dinner, just wash your face, and you will look clean and not oily.\"</p> <p>Unsatisfied with the current situation, Yi-Zhe You looks to the future. Although he has played comprehensive performances, he thinks that his shooting still needs to be improved: \"I still haven't shown everyone in the game that 'I have this ability', but I think I have to keep practicing, whether it is in training or in the game, I have to keep doing it. Of course, I hope that I can become stronger in this aspect and have weapons to challenge after I become a professional.\"</p> <p>This summer vacation, Yi-Zhe You led Cheng Chi University to compete everywhere, including the world university games in Taiwan and the other side of the strait, WUBS defeated NCAA's first-level team to win the championship, and the cross-league invitation tournament defeated the professional team undefeated and won the championship, etc. Yi-Zhe You owes everything to the team's tacit understanding, especially the amazing behind-the-back passes during the World University Games, which were circulated on the Internet. When it comes to the behind-the-back pass during the World University Games, Yi-Zhe You humbly said: \"At that time, there was not much time left. I cut in and found that there was no chance. After I turned around and found that Cheng-Hsun had a cut, I felt that it didn't matter even if I made a mistake at this time (Laughs).</p> <p>At that time, Chen-Kang (Chen-Kang Tsai) actually ran to the top of the arc, but I didn't even look at him, and I turned around and found that Cheng-Hsun was open, and finally he received it and made a beautiful layup. Only when the teammates cooperate can there be such a result.\"</p> <p>In his basketball career, two star players have had a particularly deep impact on him. When talking about his favorite NBA player, Yi-Zhe You said: \"If I have to say, it's LeBron James! He was my favorite player when I was a kid, and I watched the NBA for the first time. I was particularly impressed by his leadership ability.</p> <p>Although he is now older, I think his leadership style has been maintained. I like his interpretation of the game and I think he has a very high basketball IQ.\"</p> <p>As for the idol of Taiwanese basketball, Yi-Zhe You revealed: \"For Taiwan, it's Chen Ying-Chun. We are both playing the same position, and his performance on both ends of the offense and defense, as well as his ability to handle the ball, are what I want to learn from. His dominance on the court is something that is difficult for me to learn, but I want to move in that direction.\"</p> <p>Yi-Zhe You's excellent performance has also attracted the attention of his predecessors in the professional league. When interviewing Wei-Han Lin in the past, Wei-Han once revealed that among the new generation of players, he is particularly optimistic about Yi-Zhe. In response, Yi-Zhe You modestly said: \"I have been watching Brother Wei-Han's game. Brother Wei-Han is also the benchmark for me to learn from.</p> <p>It feels really comfortable to watch Brother Wei-Han play. He has a good grasp of controlling the rhythm. I'm really grateful for Brother Wei-Han's affirmation, and I will work harder to catch up with the footsteps of my seniors!\"</p> <p>Finally, Yi-Zhe You shared his plans for the future. After graduation, he will participate in the draft, but he is not limited to specific professional leagues such as CBA, Taiwanese basketball, or Japanese BLG. He hopes to find a team that suits his development, whether in Taiwan or elsewhere.

the end of September, when Golden State Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. and head coach Steve Kerr first publicly interacted with the media before the new season, they clearly expressed the team's position: the Warriors heading towards the 2023-24 season are not only full of confidence, but also full of trust in each other.</p> <p>Everything that troubled them last season, including interpersonal relationships, nightmares on the road, and a disappointing elimination in the conference semifinals, has been left behind.</p> <p>With Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green back on the court, it seems to announce that their era is not over yet.</p> <p>Please continue reading. However, Bob Myers, the architect of the dynasty, has also turned and left, while welcoming long-time rival Chris Paul to join the team. After entering the new season, the Warriors still have several questions that need to be answered. What is Paul's role? Are the Warriors' moves during the offseason enough? Have they found the reason for their struggles on the road last season? How will the trend of the new season affect Kerr and Thompson's contract extensions? As the preseason training camp gradually begins, here are several questions that will have the biggest impact on the Warriors and are waiting to be answered. Does CP3 need to start? How should the Warriors use this \"point guard god\"? When the Warriors acquired Paul in the summer, their biggest challenge was: how can this 38-year-old guard fit into the team? Up until now, they still don't have a clear answer. \"I haven't made a decision yet,\" Kerr said. \"I want to see how things go in training camp. We will try various options and observe the possibilities of each one.\" If the Warriors choose to start Paul, the most likely player to be replaced would be Andrew Wiggins or Kevon Looney.</p> <p>If Looney is out, the Warriors will have the shortest starting lineup in NBA history. According to the ESPN database, the lineup composed of Curry, Paul, Thompson, Green, and Wiggins will be the first starting lineup without a player taller than 6 feet 7 inches in the opening game since the Baltimore Bullets in the 1970s.</p> <p>\"We will try various small-ball lineups in training camp and preseason,\" Kerr said. \"With the excellent talent, versatility, and scoring firepower of this lineup, it should be a very difficult experiment to fail.\"</p> <p>\"We have always let Looney and Green start, and we still trust the lineup with two big men, and everyone can see that the results are excellent. But even so, we still have the option to change the lineup at any time.\"</p> <p>When the Warriors sent Jordan Poole to the Washington Wizards and acquired Paul, the general reaction would be that Paul would come off the bench and inject his veteran stability into the Warriors' bench lineup. Although he has never played as a substitute in his 18-year career, Paul has been the leader of the second unit and has played with MVP-level point guards.</p> <p>Between 2017 and 2019, when Paul played for the Houston Rockets, he played with James Harden, another guard who needed a lot of ball possession. This was Paul's first attempt in his career, and the result was very successful.</p> <p>When Paul came on the court and Harden rested, the Rockets' offensive efficiency soared, only losing to two teams: the Warriors and the Rockets when all the players were on the court.</p> <p>After the new season starts, Paul's arrival should bring more stability to the Warriors, especially when their MVP guard is resting.</p> <p>In the 2022-23 season, when Curry rested, the Warriors' offensive efficiency dropped drastically, losing nearly 8 points every 100 possessions.</p> <p>Photo source: Getty Images Will the road nightmare of last season come to an end? In the 2022-23 season, the Warriors lost all 10 away games at the beginning of the season, and their final away record was only 11 wins and 30 losses. The difference between the Warriors' home and away performances is amazing: their home record is excellent with 33 wins and 8 losses, and their defensive efficiency of 108.4 is also excellent, ranking third in the league. But when they played away games, they dropped straight down to 118.3, falling to the third worst record in the league. In the face of this phenomenon, Kerr, Curry, and Green have repeatedly emphasized that they just loosened a few screws and lost their focus when they left Chase Center. But on the other hand, the broken atmosphere caused by Green and Poole spread throughout the locker room, and Kerr later said that they did not get out of the shadow of that punch until the Warriors were eliminated by the Lakers in the playoffs.</p> <p>This time, the Warriors will quickly find the answer to this problem, because their first 10 games of the new season will be away games, and there will be 4 consecutive games. There is another challenge for the Warriors, how should this aging team deal with the new rule of limiting rest? According to the ESPN database, the Warriors are the second oldest team in the league, second only to the Milwaukee Bucks.</p> <p>Last season, the Warriors missed 45 games due to rest, which is also the highest record in the league. But from now on, the Warriors cannot do this anymore. The new regulations require teams to declare rest at least four days before the game, and they cannot rest more than two players in the same game. This will be a severe challenge for the Warriors because their main players are already in the late stage of their careers and need more rest time to maintain their best condition.</p> <p>How to rest during this season is a challenging problem for the Warriors. Of course, this is also a season to look forward to, because the Warriors will face a series of tests, and their reaction will determine whether they can return to the championship. From CP3's adaptation to the Warriors' depth, a series of tests will come as the new season approaches.</p>"},{"location":"20231017091406106187/","title":"NBADraft pic","text":"<p>NBADraft pic.twitter.com/gSFFD7MMjJIf not for Wembanyama, 6'2\" (188cm) guard Jaden Hansen, with his explosive athleticism, had a good chance of being this year's No. 1 pick.

This victory also tied the series 3-3, giving the Celtics a chance to make history. </p> <p>After the first three games, the Miami Heat led the series 3-0.

However, the Celtics still led 57-53 at halftime. The Celtics' shooting percentage of 51.3% was the key to their lead, but their three-point shooting was only 20%, which prevented them from pulling away from the Heat. </p> <p>In the second half, the Heat came close to overtaking the Celtics after a layup by Gabe Vincent, but the Celtics quickly responded with a 13-point lead thanks to Marcus Smart and Al Horford.

The Chinese team had a double-digit lead in the first quarter, and although Hong Kong regained their composure in the second quarter, the Chinese team maintained a steady lead and eventually won by 19 points. The Chinese team's victory was not a small one, but it cannot be considered a beautiful one.</p> <p>All five players on the team scored in double digits and the point differential was almost 20 points. On paper, the Chinese team's performance seemed impressive, but upon closer inspection, there are still many areas that need to be adjusted.</p> <p>Please continue reading on Instagram to see this post by Basketball Notes (@basketball_biji). The limited vision of the Chinese team's point guard was unable to fully utilize their physical advantage. In this game, the Chinese team had a height advantage at every position, especially in the paint where they had four players taller than their Hong Kong counterparts. Hong Kong's starting center, Duncan Overbeck Reid, was only 205cm, while the Chinese team's center, William Joseph Artino, was 211cm. Furthermore, Hong Kong mostly used a \"one big four small\" lineup, giving the Chinese team a significant advantage in the paint.</p> <p>However, the Chinese team did not fully capitalize on their height advantage. Hong Kong's defense was aggressive and quick to close in on the Chinese team's big men, making it difficult for them to score.</p> <p>It is a pity that Artino's passing vision was not exceptional, and he failed to make timely passes when drawing double teams, missing opportunities to take advantage of Hong Kong's compact defense.</p> <p>The performance of the Chinese team's big men may not have met expectations. Despite outscoring Hong Kong 16-12 in second-chance points, the Chinese team did not fully dominate the paint. Hong Kong's defense was effective in clogging the lane, making it difficult for the Chinese team to score inside.</p> <p>It is also worth noting that the Chinese team's defense could use some improvement. Throughout the game, they used a man-to-man defense to create turnovers and score in transition. While this strategy did result in Hong Kong committing 23 turnovers, the Chinese team was not able to capitalize on these opportunities and only scored 15 points in transition.</p> <p>However, the man-to-man defense had its drawbacks. By extending their defense to the three-point line, the Chinese team had to cover more ground, leaving more space for Hong Kong players to drive to the basket. This led to Hong Kong being able to score more easily.</p> <p>In the second half, Hong Kong took advantage of their speed and quickness to attack the basket, utilizing cuts and passes to beat the Chinese team's defense. It was evident that the Chinese team's coaching staff failed to make necessary adjustments to their defense.</p> <p>It is crucial for the coaching staff to be able to adapt to the game situation quickly. In previous games, such as the Jones Cup against Iran and the United States, the Chinese team's defense was not able to adjust to their opponents' strategies in a timely manner, resulting in them struggling to stop their opponents' scoring runs. This is an area that the coaching staff should pay attention to.</p> <p>Although the Chinese team won convincingly against Hong Kong, it was apparent that they have not reached their full potential yet. For example, their three-point shooting was off in this game, only making 22.9% of their attempts, compared to 34.6% in the Jones Cup. The Chinese team must make the most of their remaining group stage games to continue to improve and advance to the quarter-finals.</p> <p>\u203bWhy is it difficult for Taiwan to produce a player like Giannis Antetokounmpo?

However, the players they received in return may still allow the team to remain competitive. In the three-team trade led by Lillard, the Blazers not only sent away Lillard, but also several key players such as Jusuf Nurkic, Nassir Little, and Keon Johnson. Many believe that the Blazers will face a long rebuilding process, similar to what we have seen in the past with teams at the bottom of the league, producing lackluster results and hoping to secure the top draft pick to regain the ability to compete in the playoffs. However, after taking a closer look at the players the Blazers acquired, it may be too early to label them as a tanking team for next season. Please continue reading to learn more about the potential impact of the trade for Jrue Holiday from the Bucks to the Celtics on the Blazers, and how it could potentially benefit the team in the long run.</p> <p>The President of the Blazers, Joe Cronin, made some brilliant moves to minimize the impact of the trade on the team's rebuilding efforts. Below is a list of the players, draft picks, and draft swap rights the Blazers received in exchange for Lillard: Players: Deandre Ayton Robert Williams III Malcolm Brogdon Toumani Camara Draft picks: 2024 Warriors' first-round pick (top four protected) 2029 Bucks' unprotected first-round pick 2029 Celtics' unprotected first-round pick Draft swap rights: 2028 Bucks' first-round swap rights 2030 Bucks' first-round swap rights For now, let's not think about whether Cronin will use Brogdon to acquire more draft picks, or if the Bucks will become a team with highly valuable draft picks due to the departure of their star player, Giannis Antetokounmpo. Let's just focus on the potential development of the Blazers.</p> <p>Cronin did not trade away any young prospects who have only been with the team for two years, nor did he acquire players with high salaries who cannot contribute to the team's performance.</p> <p>In this trade, he acquired 2018's first overall pick Deandre Ayton, who has the potential to become a cornerstone for the team in the coming years, 2021-22's All-Defensive Second Team player and physical freak Robert Williams III, and last season's Sixth Man of the Year, Malcolm Brogdon, who is known for his steady play and outside shooting ability. Cronin stated during media day, \"We want Malcolm to be part of the team. He can bring tangible help on the court and be a good spiritual leader and big brother off the court. We need players like him because our roster is very young. I want to have enough veterans to lead these young guys.\" Please continue reading for a potential starting lineup for the Blazers if there are no further changes to the roster before the start of next season: Point guard: Malcolm Brogdon, Scoot Henderson Shooting guard: Anfernee Simons, Shaedon Sharpe Small forward: Jerami Grant, Matisse Thybulle Power forward: Robert Williams, Kris Murray, Jabari Walker Center: Deandre Ayton (Robert Williams III as backup center) This lineup does not resemble a team that is rebuilding, but rather the Blazers' performance over the past two seasons could be classified as a tanking team.</p> <p>Of course, there are still variables to consider. First, Brogdon and Williams must remain healthy throughout the season. Second, rookies Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe must show significant improvement, and Deandre Ayton must be willing to play defense.</p> <p>If everything goes as planned, the Blazers may have a chance to compete in the playoffs next April.</p> <p>Photo Credit: Getty Images This type of development is not unprecedented. The Jazz last season is a prime example. At the start of the 2022-23 season, the Jazz traded away their two main players, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert, and entered a major rebuilding phase. The Jazz used three seasons, and finally made it back to the playoffs in the 2020-21 season, playing exceptionally well. The Jazz took three seasons to rebuild, while the Blazers may only need one.</p> <p>Of course, these are just past examples and do not guarantee the success of the Blazers' trade this time. However, acquiring the Warriors' first-round pick in 2024 is crucial for the team's future success.</p> <p>The key now for the Blazers is to see the growth of rookies Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe, and the health of Brogdon and Williams.</p> <p>If everything goes according to plan, the Blazers may become one of the strongest teams in the league in the coming years. Although it may seem like a long and arduous process, the ultimate blueprint may lead the Blazers to become the ultimate winner.</p>"},{"location":"20231018091341177918/","title":"NBA player Miles Bridges has been arrested again for violating a previous restraining order, according to reports from Charlotte media yesterday","text":"<p>NBA player Miles Bridges has been arrested again for violating a previous restraining order, according to reports from Charlotte media yesterday.

This included new teammate Chris Paul, who made his debut in a Warriors uniform and scored 6 points, 5 assists, and 4 rebounds.</p> <p>The Lakers, on the other hand, did not have LeBron James on the court, as he stated earlier that he would not be playing against the Warriors.

New teammates Gabe Vincent, Christian Wood, and Cam Reddish also made appearances, but ultimately lost the game. The standout player for the Warriors was third-year player Jonathan Kuminga, who scored a team-high 24 points, along with 8 rebounds and 4 assists. He also made 4 out of 8 three-point attempts.

It would shock me if he did. I have asked him to try to shoot six three-pointers in one game, at least three in the first half.\"</p> <p>\"If I didn't think he could do it, I wouldn't ask him to.

But it has to be done in rhythm. We have to have confidence in our shots and the ball will keep going in.\"</p> <p>Ham added his thoughts on Davis' outside shooting, saying that it was one of Davis' goals during the off-season training to become a more consistent shooter from the outside, not just relying on his strengths. On the shooting aspect, Ham hopes Davis won't hesitate or overthink it, and if there's a good opportunity, we'll encourage him to shoot. However, ESPN also revealed a statistic that in the past three seasons (regular season + playoffs), among players who have attempted at least 500 jump shots, Davis ranks last in effective field goal percentage at 38%, out of 245 players. This shows that jump shooting is not Davis' strong suit. Since joining the Lakers, Davis' three-point attempts have decreased every year, with an average of only 1.3 attempts per game last year and a shooting percentage of only 25.7%. If Davis' shot attempts do increase per game, but his shooting percentage does not improve, it could be harmful to the Lakers.</p>"},{"location":"20231019091132694288/","title":"Cross-League Invitational Tournament: Nei-Oma's Alma Mater, NCCU, Not on the Same Level","text":"<p>On September 17, 2023, the first game of the Cross-League Invitational Tournament between NCCU and former teammate Yu Aizhe was reported by United Daily News journalist Tseng Szu-ju    Cross-League Invitational Tournament: Nei-Oma's Alma Mater, NCCU, Not on the Same Level</p> <p>On September 17, 2023, the first game of the Cross-League Invitational Tournament between NCCU and former teammate Yu Aizhe was reported by United Daily News journalist Tseng Szu-ju.</p> <p>Not only did NCCU win the UBA Men's Division I Championship three years in a row, but they also won the WUBS Championship in Japan this year. Today, they faced off against SBL representatives Taiwan Bank in the first game of the Cross-League Basketball Invitational Tournament. Despite missing their \"strongest foreign player\" Mobaye, they still managed to defeat Taiwan Bank 87-76. Even new Taiwan Bank player Nei-Oma praised his alma mater, saying that they have made significant improvements. Standing at 205cm, Nei-Oma is from Senegal and his first stop in Taiwan was NCCU. He joined the NCCU Eagles' men's basketball team in their first year in the UBA Men's Division I and helped them win the championship in the 109th academic year. After the season, he entered the 2021 PLG draft and was selected 7th overall by the New Taipei Kings. After two seasons with the Kings, he became a free agent this summer and officially joined Taiwan Bank in early September.</p> <p>Facing his alma mater in the Cross-League Tournament, Nei-Oma believes that NCCU has improved significantly over the years and is now on a different level compared to when he was in school.</p> <p>He pointed out that NCCU has a diverse offense, can play inside and outside, and plays as a cohesive team. However, he admitted that he didn't do well in the third quarter when NCCU outscored Taiwan Bank 25-8. He believes that if they can improve their defense, they can still stop their younger teammates. After spending several years in Taiwan, Nei-Oma can now speak some Chinese. He stated that he is currently getting to know his new Taiwan Bank teammates and used Chinese to say \"take it slow.\" He hopes to have a good season in the SBL.</p> <p>Taiwan Bank head coach Chen Guo-wei is also a member of the coaching staff for the Chinese men's basketball team at the Hangzhou Asian Games. Although he was present at the game today, assistant coach Xu Zhiqiang was in charge of the team. Chen emphasized that their loss today was due to \"losing to ourselves.\" Both their offense and defense did not meet the standards of their usual training. He said, \"Especially at the start of the third quarter, we allowed three three-pointers and had too many turnovers on offense. We couldn't play with good ball movement and couldn't bring out our intensity. If we don't do well, this result is not unexpected.\" NCCU had new foreign player Popoka as their main inside player today. Head coach Chen Zi-wei explained that Mobaye had some family matters and is expected to return on the 19th. This Cross-League Tournament is a great opportunity for the players to encourage each other, showcase their own attitude and style, and learn from the senior players in the professional teams.</p>"},{"location":"20231019091140383181/","title":"\u4e5f\u8a31\uff0c\u6b63\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u5982\u6b64\uff0cPritchard\u7684\u7403\u611f\u8207\u904b\u7403\u88abAinge\u8a8d\u70ba\u662f\u585e\u723e\u63d0\u514b\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7c4c\u78bc\u3002","text":"<p>\u4f46\u82e5\u662f\u7da0\u886b\u8ecd\u4e00\u65e6\u62ff\u4e0bHoliday\uff0cPritchard\u662f\u5426\u9084\u6709\u4e0a\u5834\u6a5f\u6703\uff1f\u4ed6\u662f\u5426\u9084\u662f\u585e\u723e\u63d0\u514b\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7c4c\u78bc\uff1f</p> <p>\u5f9e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u4ee5\u767c\u73fe\uff0cPritchard\u5728\u904e\u53bb3\u500b\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u5c31\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u88ab\u9ad4\u7cfb\u57cb\u6c92\u7684\u904b\u7403\u9054\u4eba\uff0c\u7121\u6cd5\u76e1\u60c5\u5c55\u73fe\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7403\u6280\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u6642\u5019\u53ea\u80fd\u64d4\u4efb\u5e95\u89d2\u8e72\u9ede\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7da0\u886b\u8ecd\u672a\u4f86\u80fd\u5920\u5f15\u9032\u66f4\u5177\u5a01\u8105\u6027\u7684\u63a7\u885b\uff0cPritchard\u4ecd\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u5728\u5834\u4e0a\u5c55\u73fe\u4ed6\u7684\u50f9\u503c\uff0c\u6210\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u89d2\u8272\u3002    \u4e5f\u8a31\uff0c\u6b63\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u5982\u6b64\uff0cPritchard\u7684\u7403\u611f\u8207\u904b\u7403\u88abAinge\u8a8d\u70ba\u662f\u585e\u723e\u63d0\u514b\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7c4c\u78bc\u3002</p> <p>\u4f46\u82e5\u662f\u7da0\u886b\u8ecd\u4e00\u65e6\u62ff\u4e0bHoliday\uff0cPritchard\u662f\u5426\u9084\u6709\u4e0a\u5834\u6a5f\u6703\uff1f\u4ed6\u662f\u5426\u9084\u662f\u585e\u723e\u63d0\u514b\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7c4c\u78bc\uff1f</p> <p>\u5f9e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u4ee5\u767c\u73fe\uff0cPritchard\u5728\u904e\u53bb3\u500b\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u5c31\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u88ab\u9ad4\u7cfb\u57cb\u6c92\u7684\u904b\u7403\u9054\u4eba\uff0c\u7121\u6cd5\u76e1\u60c5\u5c55\u73fe\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7403\u6280\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u6642\u5019\u53ea\u80fd\u64d4\u4efb\u5e95\u89d2\u8e72\u9ede\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7da0\u886b\u8ecd\u672a\u4f86\u80fd\u5920\u5f15\u9032\u66f4\u5177\u5a01\u8105\u6027\u7684\u63a7\u885b\uff0cPritchard\u4ecd\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u5728\u5834\u4e0a\u5c55\u73fe\u4ed6\u7684\u50f9\u503c\uff0c\u6210\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u89d2\u8272\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231019091143794394/","title":"Enhancing the depth of the team: The benefits Kelly Oubre Jr","text":"<p>Enhancing the depth of the team: The benefits Kelly Oubre Jr. can bring to Philadelphia</p> <p>At this moment, the lineup for the Philadelphia 76ers for their opening game against the Bucks on October 26 is basically set. Of course, things may change, perhaps the James Harden trade will eventually go through, or maybe a player will be waived, sparking the interest of the Sixers.</p> <p>Continue reading to learn about Kelly Oubre Jr., the experienced wing player who was signed by Philadelphia this summer. Although this signing may have caused some fans to question or express dissatisfaction, signing Oubre Jr. to a veteran minimum contract is actually a great addition to the wing rotation for the team.</p> <p>In fact, the players on the Sixers' roster are all very talented. They not only have the reigning MVP Joel Embiid, but also one of the most charismatic young stars in the NBA, Tyrese Maxey.</p> <p>De\u2019Anthony Melton has returned after an impressive first season with the Sixers, while Paul Reed has returned with a new contract and has the opportunity to play a new role under Nick Nurse. However, behind this lineup, there are also many question marks.</p> <p>Tobias Harris and P.J. Tucker are the starting forwards for next season, and whoever you call the small forward or power forward is fine. Behind them, the true backup wings are Oubre Jr., Danuel House Jr., Furkan Korkmaz, and Danny Green, making the competition within the team fierce.</p> <p>However, among this group, Oubre is clearly the most talented and has a better age and NBA experience.</p> <p>Let's first point out his biggest flaw - efficiency. Throughout his NBA career, his true shooting percentage has been quite inconsistent. If we want to find a reason to be optimistic, perhaps it is that his true shooting percentage has improved every year, reaching 53.4% last season.</p> <p>At the same time, for a player like him, his turnover numbers are a bit high. In his NBA career, his average turnovers (1.1) are more than his assists (1.0). In other words, when Oubre gets the ball, there is a good chance that it will leave him. This is not necessarily the worst thing, for those who are tired of seeing Harris or Tucker or any other player hesitate to take a shot when open, having Oubre on the team means not having to worry about that. Having a scoring type player on the bench who can create his own opportunities to substitute for Embiid or Maxey is definitely a good thing. As a highly anticipated lottery pick, Oubre's performance in the NBA has not lived up to expectations, but his potential still gives people hope. He stands at 198cm tall, with a wingspan of an impressive 220cm, and with his athleticism, he is still an attractive wing player. Photo credit: Getty Images</p> <p>In addition, he has defensive potential, but effort can be an issue. It is worth noting that Oubre is already 27 years old this year, just coming off a season where he averaged over 20 points per game. The best he could get was a veteran minimum contract with the Sixers, which is clearly a crossroad in his career. He is now embarking on a path that we have seen many other players take. When you have the ability but cannot play for a championship-contending team in the league, the best bet you can make is to prove yourself and hope to earn a bigger contract in the future. The most successful example of this strategy is probably Bobby Portis. Portis was selected in the first round by the Bulls in the 2015 draft and had obvious talent.</p> <p>Although Portis has achieved some success, he was not a highly sought-after player when he played for the Wizards and the Knicks. Therefore, it was surprising when he signed with the Bucks in 2020. However, what deserves recognition is that Portis played an important role off the bench for the Bucks and was one of the contributors to their championship that season.</p> <p>Portis eventually signed a 4-year, $48.5 million contract with the Bucks, which is clearly a successful turnaround story and shows that this kind of story of rising from the bottom is not unprecedented.</p> <p>Oubre and his agent, Torrel Harris, also understand that the Sixers will have enough salary cap space next season and will have Oubre's bird rights, giving them a great chance to re-sign him if things go well.</p> <p>In short, signing a talented and peak-aged player like Oubre to a veteran minimum contract just a few weeks before training camp begins is undoubtedly a good thing for the Sixers from a basketball perspective.</p> <p>Because there is basically no risk, just like signing Patrick Beverley, Mo Bamba, and Danny Green, if Oubre or any of them perform poorly, they can simply not let them play and let them go in the offseason (or even earlier).</p> <p>As the opening game approaches, Harden's situation is like a disaster, overshadowing everything the Sixers are doing. However, signing a player like Oubre is a wise move from a basketball perspective with almost no drawbacks.

Recently, he returned to his home country for an interview, talking about the incident and his current recovery.</p> <p>First, he mentioned the process of dealing with the injury at the time. Simanic said, \"Although everything seemed to be going well at first, I faced serious complications and had to have one kidney removed. It felt strange at first, but now things are getting better and I can start walking and eating. I hope to recover quickly.\"</p> <p>In fact, Simanic's injury was not a minor one. He had to undergo two surgeries to remove his kidney. Initially, the complications persisted because the doctors said that his remaining kidney was not functioning properly. Simanic recalled the situation at the time, saying, \"After undergoing two surgeries, there were five days where I had no idea what was happening outside, I didn't even have my phone. When I finally got my phone after the first surgery, I sent a message to the team, which boosted their morale, and their victory meant a lot to me. In this regard, we support each other. After that, I could only follow their matches through my phone.\"</p> <p>The report also revealed his current condition, as he stated that he will have to rest for three months and cannot do anything during this time. He will have to wait until December to know his future. Simanic said, \"This time is for my kidney to fully rest and heal. After this period, I will undergo further tests and examinations, and then we will know if I can continue playing basketball.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231019091407283700/","title":"NBAJordanClarkson earns over $1 million for representing the Philippines in the World Cup","text":"<p>Photo / Reuters Recently, Filipino media outlet PBA insider compared the compensation of Kai Sotto and Jordan Clarkson for this year's basketball World Cup    NBAJordanClarkson earns over $1 million for representing the Philippines in the World Cup </p> <p>Photo / Reuters Recently, Filipino media outlet PBA insider compared the compensation of Kai Sotto and Jordan Clarkson for this year's basketball World Cup.</p> <p>PBA insider: \"Kai Sotto received a compensation of over 11 million pesos (approximately $200,000) for his performance in the recent FIBA World Cup.</p> <p>Jordan Clarkson received over 56 million pesos (approximately $1 million).

His appearance in the warm-up game held in Keelung was also the focus of attention. But this time we are not discussing Lin, but rather focusing on the King's new foreign player, Billy Preston. There was another article that introduced Billy before, from his time as a five-star high school player to being suspended in college and ultimately not being drafted in the NBA, leading him to Taiwan.</p> <p>Billy's story can be referred to here: [NCAA] The Ripple Effect of the NCAA Recruiting Scandal - The Story of Billy Preston's Journey to the New Taipei King. The King played two warm-up games, the first against the Dreamers and the second against Jeremy Lin's mother team, the Ironmen. Unfortunately, they lost both games. Let's continue reading to see the results of Game 1 on October 8th, 2023 between the Fubon Dreamers and the New Taipei King, with a score of 101-95, and Game 2 on October 9th, 2023 between the New Taipei King and the Kaohsiung Steel Ironmen, with a score of 77-91. Of course, these were just warm-up games and the King was clearly using them to test out their lineups.</p> <p>Jeremy Lin only played 18 minutes in the first game and rested in the second, along with Manny Harris and Lee Kai-Yan. Lin Chih-Wei, Moon Tae-Jong, Hayden, and Hong Jhih-Shian only played in the second game. It was obvious that Billy was the focus of the King's lineup test.</p> <p>Although he did not start, he played 25 minutes in both games. The statistics are as follows: Opponent Time Points Rebounds Assists Steals Blocks Turnovers Fouls Field Goals Dreamers 25:21 16 4 0 2 0 0 5/10-2/2-0/0 Ironmen 24:58 13 9 3 1 1 1 2/11-1/5-2/2</p> <p>Is Billy living up to his five-star potential? Let's briefly discuss his performance in these two warm-up games.</p> <p>Firstly, Billy doesn't have any major issues with his speed and can shoot mid-range shots well. He also has a good first step and can play off-ball, but we have yet to see his organizational skills or passing ability. One potential problem he may encounter is his lack of physicality and footwork in the paint; he may also be a bit absent-minded on defense and not as aggressive in setting screens. In Game 2, he faced Ironmen's \"Peng Peng\" Chen Guan-Quan and his shooting accuracy decreased significantly after physical contact (although he didn't have this issue against smaller local players in the fourth quarter of Game 2), so he will need to rely on his speed advantage to adjust. But his style of play and positioning as a foreign player is different from traditional power forwards or centers, and he is not someone who likes to engage in physical battles or frequent body contact.</p> <p>In terms of the King's lineup, having him play high-post or pick-and-roll may not be the best solution. Please continue reading. From what we've seen so far, his playing style of not needing the ball much may affect his dominance on the court.</p> <p>But with a strong backcourt in the King, not only the Lin brothers but also the bench players like Lee Kai-Yan and Hong Jhih-Shian who can control the game, his mid-range abilities and scoring advantage will be a great choice to maintain good ball movement and avoid offensive stagnation.</p> <p>With Jeremy Lin in the regular season, Billy will have more opportunities to score with his mid-range shots. He seems to be in better form than the King's other Asian foreign player, Hayden, and he does have a glimpse of his five-star high school potential in terms of coordination and mobility.</p> <p>In the future, he will need to overcome the challenge of facing foreign players from other PLG teams, such as the physically strong and experienced Kennedy Meeks from the Yulon Luxgens or the physically imposing Earl Clark from the Taiwan Beer. Will he be able to use his speed advantage to make up for his lack of physicality and avoid getting into foul trouble? This will directly affect his playing time. Please continue reading. As it seems that Davies is already showing signs of his age and injuries, unless there are changes to the PLG's foreign player usage rules (such as allowing two foreign players on the court in the fourth quarter), Billy will likely have to take on more responsibility on both ends of the court when the King only has one foreign player on the court. How he can minimize the risk of injury on defense will be the key to unlocking his offensive potential this season.</p> <p>Otherwise, if the rule for having only one foreign player on the court in the fourth quarter remains the same, Billy will have a good chance to play on the wing when Q is in the paint. If the King wants to play at a fast pace, they also have Manny Harris, who specializes in this type of play, and with Moon Tae-Jong and Michel focusing on defense in the paint, Billy's positioning may become awkward. Let's look forward to the start of the regular season and the Eastern Super League!

The 20-point difference is simply due to the gap in physical talent. In the first 5 minutes of the first quarter and the third quarter, the Chinese team showed competitiveness and was able to keep up with China in terms of scoring. However, the players' fatigue eventually led to poor communication on defense, resulting in mismatches and openings for China to take advantage of. This also allowed China to conserve their energy and not exhaust themselves with a run-and-gun style of play. Photo/Chinese Olympic Committee</p> <p>The Chinese team's scoring may falter, but it will not be because of Lin Tingqian's ball-handling. In fact, his control of the ball creates more space for his teammates to score. Players like Zhao Jiwei, Zhao Rui, and Hu Mingxuan had to take turns pressuring Lin Tingqian, leaving them unable to help defend other players. However, Lin Tingqian remained composed and did not make many mistakes due to the pressure. His few turnovers were a result of trying to force a play against the Chinese national team, who are more challenging opponents than those in the CBA league. Finding a balance between controlling the ball and attacking independently will be a new challenge for him, and I believe he will improve after the Asian Games.</p> <p>Please continue reading below.</p> <p>Liu Zheng was also a key target for China's defense. He only made 2 out of 12 shots throughout the game, but this cannot be blamed on his shooting. The physical demands of defending against China are much greater than his role in the CBA league. He had to defend, help defend, and steal the ball during fast breaks, but he still could not get past China's defensive wall. Hopefully, the coaching staff can lighten his load and allow him to focus on the task at hand. This also tests the adaptability of the coaching staff. Photo/Chinese Olympic Committee</p> <p>Abasi's offensive performance was on fire, and he had the physical advantage over Chinese players. His shooting was also on point, making him the player with the highest plus/minus on the team. However, he only played for 22 minutes, and I believe he deserves more playing time. He could even be used to defend the opponent's ball-handler, which would be a good choice. It's clear that Abasi wanted to keep the game close with his scoring. Perhaps he is better suited to disrupt the opponent's ball-handling.</p> <p>Photo/Chinese Olympic Committee</p> <p>In the first game of the group stage against Hong Kong, I did not follow why Atino received a technical foul and a disqualifying foul. However, against China, he was aggressive in the paint. He has clearly improved his layups from last season with the Guangzhou Long-Lions. What's even more commendable is that he didn't take too many unnecessary 3-pointers and focused on rebounding, defending in the paint, and even drawing fouls. His temper, which was often criticized, has also improved, but his lack of physicality prevented him from protecting the paint against players like Hu Jinqiu, Wang Zelin, and Zhang Zhenlin. This is just something he cannot control. At least he was able to contribute offensively in this game. In the last game of the group stage against Mongolia, the Chinese team should easily secure a victory and advance to the top 12. I hope that the Chinese team can quickly adjust their form during the group stage, and each player can play their role on the court. I also hope to see the coaching staff make more decisive and flexible adjustments, as playing it safe may make it more difficult for the starting lineup to keep up with the pace of the game.

Daniel Ochefu, also known as O'Neal Fu, is a typical playmaking center who serves as the team's second or third option on offense. He doesn't panic when faced with double teams and takes his time to observe his teammates' movement before making the best pass. This type of player can easily fit into any team's system and the only concern might be his speed. It's unclear whether the fast pace and rhythm of the Lioneers' offense is too much for him or if he's just conserving his energy against a weaker team like Singapore. His offensive performance has yet to be seen and we can wait until the official warm-up games to determine if he can provide scoring for the Lioneers. On defense, he has a decent level of skill and won't easily fall for fake movements. He pays close attention to his opponent's shooting position and can disrupt their shot. However, his ability to grab offensive rebounds may need some improvement.</p> <p>Taylor Braun is a familiar face for many, having played for the Taiwan Beer and Yulon Luxgen Dinos in the past. He's a versatile player who can play from the point guard to power forward position, but he's not a dominant foreign player. He's more of a jack-of-all-trades type of player and his impact on the Lioneers may not be as big as O'Neal Fu or Artino. With Artino and Chou Yung-huang currently preparing for the Asian Games, it's hard to say how well they will mesh with the team. Braun's value may only be seen in the playoffs, but that's only if the coaching staff becomes more flexible in their lineup adjustments and we get to see a different side of the Lioneers. Moving on to discuss the team's local reinforcements, the only notable addition is Wang Tzu-kang. Last season with the Taiwan Beer, he played in 25 games with an average of 31.6 minutes, 12.5 points, and 3.2 assists per game. His three-point shooting was a highlight, averaging 2.6 three-pointers made per game with a 37.6% shooting percentage. As the top scorer for Taiwan Beer last season, he can provide much-needed three-point shooting for the Lioneers. However, he needs the right tactics to be an effective shooter, just like his teammate Chu Yung-hao. Unfortunately, last season, it was hard to see any specific tactics designed for shooters, forcing them to create their own opportunities through their dribbling skills. Hopefully, with a twin tower lineup, Wang will have more chances to shoot. Another interesting addition is undrafted rookie Liu Kuang-shang, picked up by the Lioneers. He has a soft shooting touch and stands at 192cm with good mobility. From a development perspective, his potential and floor seem to be higher than at least 70% of this year's draft class. He has also gained some weight since his college days, but it doesn't seem to have affected his speed and has actually improved his physical control after contact. While the Singaporean team may not be high-scoring, their players are generally bigger than the Lioneers'. Therefore, the Lioneers' players should focus on bulking up their bodies as well. If they only rely on speed and steals, they will be easily figured out by their opponents without a solid foundation.</p> <p>In terms of defense, the FIBA referees are much stricter than those in local games. They pay close attention to contact with the cylinder and whether the collision between two players is reasonable. This is something that local players need to observe, discuss, or communicate with the referees on the court. There will always be disagreements between the players and the referees, but it's important to understand the reasoning behind the calls so they can make quick adjustments on the court.</p>"},{"location":"20231020091149369652/","title":"\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0cKessler\u7684\u958b\u767c\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u4ed6\u7684\u66ff\u88dc\u3001\u4f11\u606f\u548c\u8b8a\u6210\u5148\u767c\u7684\u6a5f\u6703\u6703\u6709\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\u4ed6\u662f\u5426\u6703\u5728\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u5167\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u540d\u806f\u76df\u7d1a\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u4ed6\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u7684\u5169\u500b\u8cfd\u5b63\u6240\u505a\u7684\u90a3\u6a23\uff1f\u9084\u662f\u4ed6\u6703\u50cf\u4ed6\u5728\u5927\u5b78\u6642\u671f\u6240\u5c55\u73fe\u7684\u90a3\u6a23\uff0c\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u540d\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u50b3\u7d71\u8b77\u6846\u7403\u54e1\uff1f\u8acb\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5f80\u4e0b\u95b1\u8b80\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u5e73\u884c\u6642\u7a7a\u88e1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u67d0\u4e00\u5929\u770b\u5230\u9019\u500b\u4ea4\u6613\u6848\u7684\u5f8c\u7e8c\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u9019\u88e1\u6211\u5011\u53ea\u80fd\u731c\u6e2c\u3002\u4f46\u7121\u8ad6\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u9019\u7a2e\u60f3\u50cf\u90fd\u662f\u5728\u5e73\u884c\u6642\u7a7a\u4e0b\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u6211\u5011\u6240\u80fd\u505a\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95dc\u6ce8\u660e\u5c3c\u8607\u9054\u7070\u72fc\u968a\uff0c\u4e26\u671f\u5f85\u4ed6\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\u3002","text":"<p>Imagining the Future of the Timberwolves if the Gobert Trade Had Never Happened</p> <p>When the game No Man's Sky was released, it was hailed as a glimpse into the future    \u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\uff0cKessler\u7684\u958b\u767c\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u4ed6\u7684\u66ff\u88dc\u3001\u4f11\u606f\u548c\u8b8a\u6210\u5148\u767c\u7684\u6a5f\u6703\u6703\u6709\u591a\u5c11\uff1f\u4ed6\u662f\u5426\u6703\u5728\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u5167\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u540d\u806f\u76df\u7d1a\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u4ed6\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u7684\u5169\u500b\u8cfd\u5b63\u6240\u505a\u7684\u90a3\u6a23\uff1f\u9084\u662f\u4ed6\u6703\u50cf\u4ed6\u5728\u5927\u5b78\u6642\u671f\u6240\u5c55\u73fe\u7684\u90a3\u6a23\uff0c\u6210\u70ba\u4e00\u540d\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u50b3\u7d71\u8b77\u6846\u7403\u54e1\uff1f\u8acb\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5f80\u4e0b\u95b1\u8b80\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u500b\u5e73\u884c\u6642\u7a7a\u88e1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u67d0\u4e00\u5929\u770b\u5230\u9019\u500b\u4ea4\u6613\u6848\u7684\u5f8c\u7e8c\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u9019\u88e1\u6211\u5011\u53ea\u80fd\u731c\u6e2c\u3002\u4f46\u7121\u8ad6\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u9019\u7a2e\u60f3\u50cf\u90fd\u662f\u5728\u5e73\u884c\u6642\u7a7a\u4e0b\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u6211\u5011\u6240\u80fd\u505a\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95dc\u6ce8\u660e\u5c3c\u8607\u9054\u7070\u72fc\u968a\uff0c\u4e26\u671f\u5f85\u4ed6\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\u3002 </p> <p>Imagining the Future of the Timberwolves if the Gobert Trade Had Never Happened</p> <p>When the game No Man's Sky was released, it was hailed as a glimpse into the future. The game boasted extreme features generated by algorithms and 180 billion explorable planets, a number too vast to comprehend. The game's design centered around navigating and surviving on these planets.</p> <p>However, this was not a new concept, as exploration games have been around for a long time, with the earliest form appearing in the 1979 text game Adventure. This genre evolved into a more recognizable form in the 1980s with games like Mystery House, which featured graphical elements, although they were pixelated on the screen.</p> <p>But despite its promise, the game's release ended in a spectacular failure. The developers of No Man's Sky, Hello Games, failed to realize that even with 180 billion planets, if none of them were worth investing in, the quantity became meaningless. The game lacked elements that could attract players, so there was no reason for them to spend time playing. In fact, there always needs to be something to keep people going until something is fully realized.</p> <p>This is why the previous Gobert trade and the way the Timberwolves handled it was so confusing. Instead of the new rookie Walker Kessler, who was expected to be Karl-Anthony Towns' partner before Gobert arrived, the Timberwolves gave up at least five draft picks. This leads to the question, what would have happened if they had kept Kessler and tried to pair Towns with a traditional big man? Of course, the biggest issue would be Towns' health, but at least Naz Reid would have had a chance to shine. The next question would be whether Reid would have started in Towns' absence, or if Kessler, who was not traded for Gobert, would have started, just like the Timberwolves did in the 40 games following Towns' injury last season. However, these are all just good questions now, as we can no longer imagine the outcome.</p> <p>In a different perspective, the Timberwolves were desperate for a point guard last season.</p> <p>D'Angelo Russell was occasionally injured and traded, Jordan McLaughlin was placed on the injured reserve due to a calf strain, and Austin Rivers barely made the cut to avoid being cut.</p> <p>During this time of point guard shortage, the Timberwolves' rookie Wendell Moore Jr. was benched and never given a chance until his debut as a starter, when the answer became clear. To put it simply, Moore didn't deserve playing time on a team that needed a point guard.</p> <p>Moore's debut was exciting, but it was short-lived. After the Gobert trade, Towns and Gobert's initial pairing seemed like a disaster, so it's not an exaggeration to say that the same could have happened with Kessler.</p> <p>Although comparing Moore and Keesler, two rookies, is absurd, the comparison of situations and opportunity costs for the Timberwolves is not.</p> <p>We are uncertain if the Timberwolves' management believed that rookie players could contribute in their rookie season, but Leonard Miller, selected this year, seems to have a chance to play and maintain a stable playing time. However, with players like Towns, Gobert, Kyle Anderson, and Naz Reid rotating at the 4 and 5 positions, it seems unlikely that he will have many opportunities unless there are major injuries.</p> <p>Photo credit: Getty Images Another rookie, Josh Minott, is likely to only play during garbage time, and Jaylen Clark, who signed a two-way contract, is likely to be out due to injury.</p> <p>In a parallel universe, Kessler could have been an outstanding young player and played an important role as the Timberwolves' center, just like he did on the Jazz.</p> <p>However, it's also possible that he would have spent the whole season in Iowa (Timberwolves' development league) while the Timberwolves missed the playoffs due to the absence of Gobert and declining performances from players like Malik Beasley and Jarred Vanderbilt. In another possible scenario, what would happen in the end? For example, would Towns be traded, and the Timberwolves would build their team around Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, and Kessler? Would the Timberwolves follow through with their actual offseason moves, simply rebuilding the team without learning anything from their intense first-round series against eventual champions, the Denver Nuggets?</p> <p>In another possible scenario, how would Kessler's development have gone? How many opportunities would he have for backup, rest, and starting? Would he become a league-level defender in a short period, like he did in the past two seasons? Or would he become an excellent traditional big man, like he did in college? In a parallel universe, we may one day see the sequel to this trade, but for now, we can only speculate. Regardless, this imagination takes place in a parallel universe, and all we can do is continue to follow the Timberwolves and hope for their success in the future.</p>"},{"location":"20231020091220789944/","title":"PLG Flying Ape Coaching Team Strengthens Again, Ma Yihong Serves as Assistant Coach","text":"<p>Tao Yuan Puyuan Flying Ape announced today (10/11) that they have strengthened their coaching team with the addition of former national basketball player Ma Yihong, who will be a member of the team's coaching staff in the upcoming season   PLG Flying Ape Coaching Team Strengthens Again, Ma Yihong Serves as Assistant Coach</p> <p>Tao Yuan Puyuan Flying Ape announced today (10/11) that they have strengthened their coaching team with the addition of former national basketball player Ma Yihong, who will be a member of the team's coaching staff in the upcoming season.

Due to his lack of dribbling ability, he struggled to create his own scoring opportunities. With Haliburton's injury, his passing quality also decreased, resulting in an average of only 15 points per game in the following four months. Although 15 points is still considered good for a rookie, it is not up to par for someone who the Pacers have high expectations for as a potential sidekick to Haliburton (or even potentially the team's future leader).</p> <p>During his training to improve his ball-handling skills, his three-point shooting, which was once his strength, also suffered, with his shooting percentage dropping below 30%. He often rushed to take shots after receiving the ball, without properly observing the defense and making decisions. As a top scorer, Mathurin still has a long way to go.</p> <p>Fortunately, after hitting a wall for a few months, Mathurin was able to bring his average points back up to above 19 in April. However, this does not mean that he has overcome his struggles with ball-handling. It simply means that he has returned to his comfort zone, with his AST% back up to 13% (previously below 8.5). This also means that for now, Mathurin should focus on being a reliable off-ball scorer, while his ball-handling skills still need improvement.</p> <p>Is there a transformation? Let's fast forward to this year's summer league. While everyone is amazed by the transformation of second-year players like Keegan Murray from the Sacramento Kings and Jabari Smith Jr. from the Houston Rockets, I am also excited to see what new skills Bennedict Mathurin will bring to the fans. However, upon watching the Pacers' games, besides seeing Nembhard continue to showcase his amazing passing skills, and Jarace Walker's dominant defense, the rest of the team's performance was lackluster, especially Mathurin's disappointing performance. He often took rushed shots, made mistakes while driving into a crowded defense, and showed no progress in making decisions when facing closeouts from defenders. It is worrisome that Mathurin may end up like former Kings player Ben McLemore, with great athleticism and smooth shooting, but lacking offensive skills on the court.</p> <p>Mathurin's problems can be summarized into the following points: ball-handling is the key for a player to go from being a role player to a star or even a superstar. Many players who were once hailed as the next big thing failed to overcome this hurdle and ended up as role players or even leaving the league.</p> <p>Mathurin's biggest problem with ball-handling is his lack of change of pace, coupled with average ball-handling skills, which limits him to only relying on his first step to beat defenders. However, in a league full of athletic players, this is not enough. Therefore, it is common to see Mathurin struggle to beat his defender and end up taking low-efficiency shots.</p> <p>Another issue is his lack of court vision. After finally getting past the first line of defense, he struggles to read the defense and find opportunities to attack or pass to open teammates. As a result, he often falls into traps set by the opposing team's second and third line of defense, resulting in turnovers or rushed shots.</p> <p>Lastly, when he does get past the defense and has a chance to finish at the rim, he lacks a reliable finishing move. Compared to his teammates like Haliburton and Nembhard, who may not have the best physicality, they have a go-to move to score when faced with defenders. However, Mathurin lacks this finishing touch, and often struggles to convert at the rim.</p> <p>Becoming a Key Man</p> <p>After enduring a tough season and the failed contract negotiations with Buddy Hield, it is almost certain that Mathurin will have more opportunities to start next season, which also means he will have more chances to play alongside Haliburton and Myles Turner. This also means that his ball-handling responsibilities may decrease, and he can focus on his strengths, such as catch-and-shoot opportunities, and even attacking the basket after receiving a pass from his teammates.</p> <p>However, this is still not enough. I hope that he can continue to work on his flaws during the season and become a key player for the Pacers, forming a formidable offensive trio.</p>"},{"location":"20231021091133405407/","title":"According to reports from ESPN, the Houston Rockets have traded Kevin Porter Jr","text":"<p>According to reports from ESPN, the Houston Rockets have traded Kevin Porter Jr. and two second-round picks to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Victor Oladipo and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl.

The newly appointed GM, Zhang Shuren, has recently announced the addition of Serbian coach Milan Mitrovic to the coaching staff, hoping to bring his past experiences and lead a revamp of the team both on and off the court. What changes and improvements will this bring to the team, let's take a closer look.</p> <p>Please continue reading below \u25bc</p> <p>With the arrival of Zhang Shuren as the new GM, the Siege Lions have undergone some changes both on and off the court. First, their title sponsor has ended their partnership, and the team name will go back to \"Hsinchu Siege Lions\" as they start anew. The long-vacant GM position is now filled by Zhang Shuren, who previously served as the GM of New Taipei Citibank and the secretary general of the T1 League. He hopes to bring changes from within and elevate the team to pursue their first championship in history.</p> <p>Zhang Shuren holds a Master of Business Administration from Johns Hopkins University and has held various positions in media and team management. He is familiar with both baseball and basketball industries, and has also served as a public relations and spokesperson for international events. He is highly respected in the industry and is considered one of the top management talents.</p> <p>[Exclusive interview] Zhang Shuren, the new GM of the Hsinchu Street Attack Lions: \"We want to bring Hsinchu's support to the world and exchange with other teams.\" The above is an excerpt from a previous interview with Zhang Shuren by the author. If you are interested in his thoughts and expectations for the future of the team, please take some time to read the full interview. Zhang Shuren has held various positions and changed teams in the past few years, but he always talks about completing each stage of his mission, which shows his high standards and execution in different roles. Facing the changing trend of basketball development in Asia, it was the main reason for him to take on the role of GM once again. He hopes to lead the team to go international and become a professional team.</p> <p>From recent news, it seems that their efforts are already in motion and more people are starting to take notice.</p> <p>Please continue reading below \u25bc In July of this year, the Hsinchu Siege Lions signed a sister team agreement with the Japanese B.LEAGUE's Aomori Wat's, and the team is planning to have them visit their home court for the opening game of the new season. They have also taken their long-trained youth team to visit the home court of the Ryukyu Golden Kings, for venue tours and friendly matches, to help the team grow both on and off the court. Recently, they also went to Xiamen to participate in the \"Xiamen Professional Basketball Invitational\" and will head to Singapore at the end of the month to participate in the FIBA Continental Cup showcase game. They will also travel with fans and the Lion Girls to cheer on the team. Since Zhang Shuren's arrival, these efforts have been accelerated and executed more efficiently. As for the team roster, Zhang Shuren believes: \"In the past two years, I have come to understand the importance of team basketball. The focus of this off-season preparation for the Siege Lions is how to develop our local players and combine them with the strengths of foreign players on both ends of the court.\" With the foreign players yet to be finalized, there is still plenty of room for exploration and maneuvering. Fans can look forward to seeing who will join the team. As for local operations, he said: \"In the past three years, the Siege Lions and the Lion Purple Army have truly embodied the concept of 'this city needs a team'. I hope that in the next season, in addition to being the team that brings the city together the most, we will also bring glory back to this city.\"</p> <p>It seems that they are ready for a transformation. Please continue reading below \u25bc With the arrival of the European-style assistant coach, can the Lion Army spark a team revolution? Zhang Shuren's first move as GM was to recruit Serbian coach Milan Mitrovic to the coaching staff, hoping to inject a European style of play into the team and achieve their first victory. When making the official announcement, he mentioned: \"European players have a deep understanding of basketball and are able to read the game situation well. By recruiting a Serbian assistant coach, we hope to bring elements of European basketball to help the Siege Lions implement their team basketball philosophy.\" It seems that they may be looking to replicate the successful model of the Yellow to Purple transition to build a new team.</p> <p>At the age of 42, Mitrovic has rich coaching experience and is particularly good at player development. He has served as an assistant coach in various European leagues, including Serbia, Romania, and Poland. From 2014 to 2021, he was the assistant coach of CSM Oradea in the Romanian Basketball League, a team that regularly makes it to the playoffs and has helped them win the championship three times. He has even had a role in the national team. After a brief stint in the Polish league two years ago, he returned to Romania last year to become the head coach of FC Arges Pitesti. This is his first time coaching in Asia.</p> <p>When interviewed, Mitrovic said: \"I will pay special attention to defensive details in the future. I believe that the subtle aspects of defense will be the key to winning in the future. I will analyze each player's strengths and weaknesses through videos and provide assistance to head coach Kuan Lun both in team training and individual skill development.\" This touches on the Lion team's biggest weakness from last year, where they ranked last in the league with an average of 99.6 points allowed per game. By strengthening their defense through discipline and a systematic team connection, they may be able to turn things around.</p> <p>At this stage of transformation, the key personnel both on and off the court are in place. The next step is to see how the players adapt and perform, as well as the fluidity of their basketball operations. These are all concerns of the fans, and with the guidance of GM Zhang Shuren, the team's atmosphere is expected to be different. We look forward to more surprises and glory from the Siege Lions in the upcoming season.</p>"},{"location":"20231021091152202861/","title":"The video shows NBA player Nikola Jokic","text":"<p>The video shows NBA player Nikola Jokic.</p> <p>Photo/Courtesy of Nuggets Team and NBA Official.

He told The Sporting News, \"After I left the University of Texas, the people around me told me to keep an open mind.\"</p> <p>\"I went to visit the G League and see if everything they told me when they recruited me was true, and it turned out to be even more than I expected.\" Please continue reading below. Holland wants to choose the best option for his development, and since the establishment of the Ignite team in 2019-20, no plan has produced more NBA players than them. Holland also mentioned the third pick in the 2023 draft: \"Regarding this matter, I have definitely talked to Scoot (Henderson) a lot, because he is the most recent player they sent to the NBA.\"</p> <p>\"When I talked to him, he mentioned that if going to the NBA is what you want to do, they can provide everything you might ask for.\"</p> <p>\"I think this is the right path.

Although he repeatedly mentioned that he is working hard to develop and improve his offensive performance, he knows that defense is his unique advantage.</p> <p>Please continue reading below. Holland confidently said, \"The most important thing about defense is that I just hate losing. I know that if I can lock down on defense, it means that the opponent cannot score. If they cannot score, they cannot win the game. It's really just that mindset.\" Although many promising players like to say that they like to watch Kobe Bryant or Kevin Durant, Holland chooses to focus on some of his favorite defensive disruptors to emulate. Holland told TSN, \"I studied Jrue Holiday very seriously. He is one of the best defenders in the league, and it really is how hard he works on defense, and how much he controls the opponent's offense. He knows how the opponent will attack, and he knows who should be where, so he can help his teammates lock down their positions and arrange the formation.\"</p> <p>He also mentioned that he sees similarities between his trajectory and Phoenix Suns' rising star Mikal Bridges. Holland said, \"Before Mikal Bridges became a high-level player, his job was to defend the best offensive player and take shots when he was open.\"</p> <p>\"How he closely follows the ball, and accepts his role to confirm whether the best player on the opponent's team can score, this is not easy. The level of defense he locks in is the direction I want to work towards.\" Holland emphasized that his versatility is his biggest advantage as a new generation player. He strives to excel in his role, just like Bridges has done on his two teams so far in his career.</p> <p>Holland said, \"The more versatile your abilities are, the more valuable you are. The more versatile you are, the easier the game becomes, because no matter where you are placed, the coach can trust you to do your job.\"</p> <p>\"I think I can do this in the league. No matter where I go, I can fulfill my duties. I can defend positions one through five, so it doesn't really matter. I'm ready to accept a role.\" Holland also mentioned that his goal is to lead the Ignite team to win the G League championship this season. At the same time, he hopes to maintain his weight between 90 and 93 kilograms to help him establish himself as a defensive player in the NBA.</p> <p>Beneath his appearance and strong physique, Holland has a confident mindset and a firm belief in himself. Even when faced with challenges like the NBA Draft, he still believes that he can become the next top pick.</p>"},{"location":"20231021091323115388/","title":"In the 3x3 men's basketball competition at the Asian Games, where players under the age of 23 are eligible, the Chinese team composed of Lin Xinkuan, Jiang Jun, Wang Zheyu, and Yu Xiangping pulled off a stunning comeback victory against Qatar in the final match","text":"<p>In the 3x3 men's basketball competition at the Asian Games, where players under the age of 23 are eligible, the Chinese team composed of Lin Xinkuan, Jiang Jun, Wang Zheyu, and Yu Xiangping pulled off a stunning comeback victory against Qatar in the final match.

When Harden announced \"opt-in &amp; trade me,\" he achieved the result of burning bridges, but the following developments were helpless, like a monkey about to be thrown away.</p> <p>For the 76ers, they know they have to trade time for space. It's really difficult to find a team willing to use the bird rights to re-sign a high age star player for just half a season. On the other hand, for a contender who wants to make a run for the championship, the option of renting for half a season may be more attractive. James Harden is helpless, but he can only watch his precious time slowly slip away, as the dominant party in the trade is not the player himself. But what fans care about more may not be how James Harden feels at this moment, but whether the 76ers can find a suitable new team before the trade deadline, to avoid James Harden's salary being taken off the books and losing the salary cap advantage.</p> <p>Please continue reading about Morey's thoughts. He is currently walking on a tightrope in terms of managing the team, and one wrong move could lead to disaster. But if he can also handle the expiring contracts of Harden and Tobias Harris, there is still a chance to make another run during Embiid's prime. Whether we can trade for a suitable wing player, I don't know, but the window for winning the championship is definitely smaller than last year.

In the United States, we can see that the NCAA has incorporated the home and away game system, which makes student sports an integral part of campus culture and a core that brings students and alumni together. That is the true value of sports.\"</p> <p>NTNU President Wu Cheng-chi hopes that by following the successful experience of the NCAA home and away game system, Taiwan's basketball and campus culture will be revitalized. Photo/CBL Former NTNU alumnus and current coach of the National Chengchi University men's basketball team, Chen Tzu-wei, said, \"The home and away game system of the NCAA is a model that Taiwan can learn from. It not only bridges the gap between current students and alumni but also allows alumni to return to their alma mater to support and pay attention to the development of sports, creating long-term benefits for the development of sports.\"</p> <p>NTNU men's basketball coach Lee Ping-hung also responded, \"Different from playing in the same arena in a league, the home and away system highlights the players' adaptability to different environments, adding more challenges to the game.\" He also jokingly challenged Chen Tzu-wei, \"When NTNU won three consecutive championships on their home court, you were the coach. Now that you have moved on to another university and won three consecutive championships there, I look forward to competing against you on our home court and taking back the three-peat.\"</p> <p>National Chengchi University coach Chen Tzu-wei believes that the NCAA home and away game system and campus sports culture are models that Taiwan can learn from.

I thank my alma mater for providing a platform for players to showcase their talents and giving them more opportunities to perform. Every opportunity is precious and important, and I encourage my juniors to cherish and enjoy the atmosphere of the home and away games,\" said Wu Yong-ren, emphasizing the importance of introducing successful experiences from other countries to bring new and positive energy to Taiwanese basketball and help players grow and improve.</p> <p>The tournament will take place for two months from October 5th to November 30th. The Dean of the College of Sports and Recreation at NTNU, Chi Li-kang, believes that the CBL Invitational Tournament is not just a sports event, but also a starting point for creating a new force in the student basketball and sports environment in Taiwan.

Today (19), the team officially announced the signing of Li Ruiqi. During his graduate studies at Shoufu University, Li Ruiqi's outstanding jumping ability and offensive skills earned him the \"Scoring King\" and \"Rebounding King\" titles in the UBA Men's Division 1 league. He played for the Fubon Braves from 2017 to 2019, joined the Kaohsiung Jutai Technology team from 2019 to 2021, and joined the P. LEAGUE+ New Taipei Kings from 2021 to 2023.</p> <p>In the 2021-22 season, he averaged 4 points and 2.2 rebounds as a substitute. In the middle of the 2022-23 season, he suffered a left knee injury due to a car accident and was cancelled for the rest of the season. He returned to the court for training in early July and received treatment from Fu Jen Catholic University Sports Medicine Center during his rehabilitation. Li Ruiqi has now joined the Ironman training and is undergoing rehabilitation treatment with the Ironman medical team, gradually increasing the intensity of his training.</p> <p>Having not trained on the court for almost a year, Li Ruiqi's short-term goal is to play in the warm-up game and reunite with fans as soon as possible. Li Ruiqi is originally from Tainan and attended Xingrong High School and Shoufu University. Most of his educational career was in southern Taiwan. Now, after moving to the north and joining the Ironman in Kaohsiung, he was reminded of the warmth of his hometown when he encountered a low point in his career and life due to the car accident last season.</p> <p>Speaking of his decision to return to the south, Li Ruiqi said, \"My wife and child are still in Taipei, and I am worried and reluctant to leave them. But with the full support of my family, I can play in Kaohsiung without any worries and hope to create my own value here.\" Head coach Qiu Dazong said, \"Ruiqi is a 3D player with high basketball IQ. He has a clear mind on the court and plays with great intensity. He also often encourages and reminds his teammates off the court. As a local player for the Ironman, he brings a very positive development in both playing style and culture.\"</p> <p>Head coach Qiu Dazong also recognized Li Ruiqi's strong desire to return to the court and hopes he can recover quickly and contribute to the Ironman's success.</p>"},{"location":"20231021092007217909/","title":"In a surprising move, the Sacramento Kings have decided to waive Nerlens Noel, who they just signed in the summer, along with young player Neemias Queta","text":"<p>In a surprising move, the Sacramento Kings have decided to waive Nerlens Noel, who they just signed in the summer, along with young player Neemias Queta. The main reason for this decision is the recent signing of center JaVale McGee, who was recently waived by the Dallas Mavericks.

According to the official announcement from T1League on September 15, after several reviews by the league's executive board, Taichung Sun failed to meet the financial qualifications set by the league and therefore, will not be allowed to participate in the new season.</p> <p>Please continue reading the full announcement from T1League below:</p> <p>Taiwan Sports Lottery and T1 League aim to develop professional basketball and organize regional, national, and international basketball tournaments to improve the level of basketball in Taiwan.</p> <p>The purpose of establishing related regulations is to establish a sound system for tournaments and protect the rights and interests of participating teams and players. Taichung Sun applied for the league's participation in the 2023-24 season, but after multiple reviews by the league's executive board, they failed to meet the financial qualifications set by the league.</p> <p>Therefore, in the 22nd executive board meeting, it was decided not to approve their participation in the 2023-24 season. This announcement is hereby made. Earlier this year, Taichung Sun protested against the league, accusing them of unilaterally changing the agreement. At that time, there were rumors about a disagreement between the executive board and Taichung Sun's participation in the new season. However, today's announcement clearly shows that the executive board rejected Taichung Sun's participation due to the team's past financial disputes. The executive board had set deadlines for Taichung Sun to provide a trust fund and guarantee money twice, but they failed to meet the requirements. As a result, the executive board voted and decided that Taichung Sun did not qualify to participate in the league. Since its establishment, Taichung Sun has been surrounded by controversies. First, their official social media accounts were suspected of using paid trolls. Some active accounts were registered in the Middle East. Later, the team made a self-mocking post about their first player being \"Arab,\" but it was not well-received by fans, leading to criticism. The team's name was also changed multiple times, and their home court at Taichung Stadium was questioned for its poor facilities. Other controversies included practicing without air conditioning, accusations of unpaid salaries, the process of obtaining a special foreign player status for White Sa, the sudden termination of foreign player Tony Bishop due to financial disputes, withdrawing from a game due to a player's positive COVID-19 test, and suddenly replacing all foreign players at the end of last season. All of these incidents have raised doubts and criticism from the public. And now, with the executive board's rejection, Taichung Sun's participation in T1League has come to an end, leaving many questions for the public. Please continue reading below. Currently, Taichung Sun still has nine players under contract, including national team player Su Yi-Jin, three-point shooting champion Lu Guan-Xuan, and White Sa with a special foreign player status. Their future plans will be closely watched. If they successfully transfer to another team, they could become valuable players for their new team. However, the biggest concern is Taichung Sun's financial situation, which has been under scrutiny in recent years. The team has been involved in the most salary and contract disputes within the professional league, raising concerns about their financial stability. While it is expected that there will be rich and poor teams in a professional league, constant salary disputes have raised doubts about Taichung Sun's management. Regardless, at this critical moment when the new season is about to start, T1League's rejection of Taichung Sun's participation means that the upcoming season will only have five teams \u2013 New Taipei CTBC Brothers, Tainan Taiwan Steel Falcons, Kaohsiung Jeoutai Technology, Taoyuan Pauian Archiland, and Taipei Fubon Braves. It is also worth noting if there will be any changes in the tournament format (including playoffs, originally six out of six), matchups, and other details.

However, the related trade has yet to materialize. Please continue reading for the media day before the 76ers' training camp, Harden was absent and only showed up two days later to join the team's training.</p> <p>This has reignited rumors about Harden being traded. Does Harden want to leave, and does Morey want to keep him? It seems like a breakup is inevitable.</p> <p>Even if the 76ers have a good lineup and are willing to put Harden on the trading table, the 34-year-old \"Beard\" may face a difficult situation with limited trade options. Harden's absence on media day and the first day of training camp was a way for him to express his desire to leave, but it was unnecessary.</p> <p>\"He wants to make the 76ers uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, ultimately, they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get the best out of him and make a trade.\"[1] Both parties want to split, so why is the trade stuck? Let's discuss a few aspects below: Please continue reading</p> <p>Objective factors are limiting, and the timing is not right. Currently, there are several teams in the league with championship potential, such as the Nuggets, Suns, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, Bucks, Celtics, Heat, and Knicks, who have all completed their roster during and after the Little Li trade. Harden missed the opportunity to join any of these teams, and also missed the trade deadline that saw CJ McCollum being sent to the Bucks. It is now much more difficult to trade to a \"specific team\" during the preseason training camp. This is not good timing.</p> <p>The so-called \"specific team\" needs to be further divided. For Harden personally, as he enters the latter stage of his career, he has already won many individual awards and was selected as one of the top 75 players in NBA history. He even took a pay cut last year to allow the 76ers to strengthen their team, and he is only missing a championship ring. He would not want to join a team without the potential to win a championship. This limits his options to only 5-8 teams. Please continue reading</p> <p>In addition, with the desire to return home to play, it seems that only the Lakers and Clippers are left as options.</p> <p>Let's talk about the Lakers first. After the failure of the partnership with the \"Ninja Turtle,\" their interest in the \"Beard\" should not be high.</p> <p>The Lakers had a successful summer, keeping their original main lineup and strengthening their team with free agents. Christian Wood and Gabe Vincent, one inside and one outside, have improved the team's strength without any pain. Backup center Jaxson Hayes has explosive physicality and can be used as a secret weapon. On the wing, they have added Taurean Prince, who brings experience and immediate impact, and Cam Reddish, who has untapped potential.</p> <p>As long as AD and LBJ are healthy, with the addition of D'Angelo Russell, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, and the new members mentioned above, they would have a good chance of beating the Nuggets 4-0.</p> <p>The Lakers lack the incentive and motivation to trade for the \"Beard.\" The status of the other teams mentioned above is not far from that of the Lakers. Would anyone be willing to dismantle a team that could potentially compete for the championship in the last 20-something days before the season begins, just to welcome Harden and lead the team? This is not a favorable situation.</p> <p>The 76ers' dream of winning the championship and the \"Beard's\" personal value are in opposition to the 76ers' position. The newly crowned MVP \"Pencil Brother\" Joel Embiid still has four years left on his contract, while both main players Harden and Tobias Harris only have one year left. The main competitors in the East, such as the Bucks and Celtics, have adjusted their teams, and the Heat still have Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. It seems necessary for the 76ers to maintain their potential to compete for the championship if they want to keep Embiid. Trading Harden would require getting back players with similar capabilities, which is fundamentally different from the considerations of the Trail Blazers when they sent away Little Li.</p> <p>Unlike Little Li, who still has four years left on his contract, the \"Beard\" did not sign an extension with the 76ers after last season and chose to exercise his player option of $35.6 million for the final year.</p> <p>Therefore, this season is like a contract year for him, and next summer he will be a free agent. If the 76ers do not take this opportunity to trade him, regardless of any unexpected circumstances that may lower his trade value, or if the two parties are deadlocked until the end of the season and Harden leaves, it will be extremely detrimental to the team.</p> <p>Since the relationship has deteriorated, and after witnessing the failure in handling the \"Simmons saga,\" it ultimately led to the arrival of the \"Beard\" in Philadelphia.</p> <p>Whether the blowing secret trade is feasible or not, it ultimately depends on Morey's decision, but it seems like the \"Beard\" has reached the final straw, and this time he is really going to blow away.</p>"},{"location":"20231022091225913620/","title":"Lin Bing-Sheng speaks out on Taishin's criticism of the dispute over the contract with the Lion City Warriors and says that legal procedures have been taken","text":"<p>Lin Bing-Sheng speaks out on Taishin's criticism of the dispute over the contract with the Lion City Warriors and says that legal procedures have been taken.</p> <p>\"Lin Bing-Sheng\" has been one of the hottest terms in Taiwanese basketball from August to now.

However, Lin Bing-Sheng later posted on his social media that he had already declined the offer to join. Later, the T1 League's new team, the Taipower Taishin Warriors, released a statement confirming that Taishin was the team that signed with Lin Bing-Sheng. They also pointed out that Taishin did indeed sign with Lin Bing-Sheng after he had terminated his contract with his former team, the New Taipei CTBC Attack, and became a free agent, which is a legitimate move. However, the Lion City Warriors have been insisting on their stance through press conferences and the mediation meeting held by the Chinese Basketball Association. Last week, they even announced that they had filed a civil lawsuit against Lin Bing-Sheng for his absence from the mediation meeting without a valid reason and demanded compensation for the loss of the team.</p> <p>Please continue reading below (photo credit: Taipower Taishin Warriors) In response to the recent controversies, the leader of the Taishin team, Shang Rui-Qiang, and Lin Bing-Sheng held a press conference today (September 11th). Lin Bing-Sheng followed his script and expressed his gratitude to the fans and media for their concern about his recent contract disputes. He also offered his sincerest apologies to the Lion City Warriors team. However, he also wanted to explain the whole story. He had negotiations with the high-level members of the Lion City Warriors, Zhang Yun-Zhi and current general manager Zhang Shu-Ren, at the end of May. They knew that his contract with his former team was not yet expired, but they signed a commission contract on May 28th, which would take effect on September 1st. However, Lin Bing-Sheng thought that he should first present his written offer to his former team and see if they would match it, but the Lion City Warriors said it was not necessary.</p> <p>Later, during the mediation meeting held by the Chinese Basketball Association, Lin Bing-Sheng showed the conversation records and pointed out that he had informed them that his appointed lawyer would attend and he did not absent himself without a valid reason.</p> <p>Even after signing the commission contract with the Lion City Warriors, other teams still contacted Lin Bing-Sheng. He asked the Lion City Warriors about it, and they said they wanted to keep it confidential and low-key. However, after consulting with his lawyer, Lin Bing-Sheng found out that the commission contract signed with the Lion City Warriors was not in accordance with the proper procedures. He then contacted Taishin and signed with them. Due to this decision, Lin Bing-Sheng repeatedly told the Lion City Warriors that he had no intention of joining them. On August 14th, he met Zhang Shu-Ren, who would later become the general manager of the Lion City Warriors, and Zhang told him that they would not announce Lin Bing-Sheng's joining. However, on August 15th, the Lion City Warriors' official social media still announced that Lin Bing-Sheng had joined the team. Lin Bing-Sheng said that he had already terminated the commission contract with the Lion City Warriors and only signed with Taishin after obtaining the departure certificate from the CTBC Attack. This is also what Taishin claims, that they signed with Lin Bing-Sheng after the CTBC Attack terminated his contract, and that is why Taishin and Lin Bing-Sheng signed after he became a free agent. According to the Taipower Taishin Warriors, their claim is that there was no problem with the transition between the contracts of Lin Bing-Sheng and the CTBC Attack. However, people are curious as to why the CTBC Attack would use their team's option in a way that would not benefit them. It was only after the CTBC Attack terminated his contract that Taishin signed with Lin Bing-Sheng. The current problem is that if what Lin Bing-Sheng says is true, and the timeline presented by Taishin today is accurate, then did the Lion City Warriors indeed contact Lin Bing-Sheng in May and sign a contract with him, regardless of the type of contract, employment or commission, and whether or not they had set a specific time? Did they really have the intention to contact a free agent and even poach him? Please continue reading below. Lin Bing-Sheng's appointed lawyer, Liao Wei-Zhi, also pointed out that Taishin's procedure was to first offer Lin Bing-Sheng a contract, then the CTBC Attack confirmed that they would not pursue him, and were willing to terminate the contract early, and only after that did Taishin sign with Lin Bing-Sheng.</p> <p>In fact, Taishin's statement today was no surprise, as they focused on the timeline of their contract with Lin Bing-Sheng compared to the CTBC Attack's contract. They can certainly hold their ground in court, even if they end up in court. However, the biggest problem in this contract dispute is that regardless of whether Lin Bing-Sheng believes that the commission contract with the Lion City Warriors is invalid, he did sign with another team after he had already signed the commission contract with them. It can be seen from the fact that he had to inform the Lion City Warriors afterwards that he had no intention of joining them. Even if it turns out that they were in the right legally, it is still not right to do so at that time. The bigger issue with this press conference is that the leader of the Taishin team came out to explain things from their perspective, but even if they were worried that Lin Bing-Sheng might accidentally reveal something or say something different from the script, the appointed lawyer should have been there to fill in the gaps or speak on his behalf. However, after Lin Bing-Sheng and the lawyer spoke, they both left without accepting any interviews from the media, leaving Shang Rui-Qiang to answer the questions. Even Shang Rui-Qiang could not explain whether Lin Bing-Sheng knew about the commission contract with the Lion City Warriors when he contacted Taishin. In the end, it all boils down to the claims of the Lion City Warriors and Taishin.

As we all know, basketball is not just about skills, it also heavily relies on physical attributes. And for Taiwan, a small country in Asia, to compete at a high level in international tournaments is not an easy task.</p> <p>Before the championship game, the Chinese team had already surpassed many strong opponents, including defeating China in the quarterfinals and overturning Korea in the semifinals. These victories were unexpected, as many believed that it was impossible for the Chinese team to beat these strong 5x5 teams in a 3x3 game. But the Chinese team proved everyone wrong and solidly won these matches. At this point, just reaching the finals was already a great achievement for the Chinese team.</p> <p>But when the Qatar players were introduced, standing tall and muscular, while the Chinese team looked smaller in comparison, I couldn't help but think, \"Let's just not lose too badly. A silver medal is already great.\" And in the beginning of the game, it seemed like the Qatar team was dominating, with their two shooters and one inside player quickly taking a 5-point lead. I thought to myself, \"This is the difference between us.\"</p> <p>However, fueled by our love for our country and my personal love for 3x3 basketball (it's basically Taiwan's national sport and you can play it anywhere), I still had hope for our team. Even though Qatar's shooters were accurate and our offense wasn't working, I couldn't help but curse in front of the TV, \"How can we not make any shots?\" \"What kind of defense is this? They're not even attacking the inside and they're still more accurate than us.\" Throughout the game, the Chinese team was constantly behind, and I believe all Taiwanese fans thought it would be a difficult game to win.</p> <p>But as those who watched the broadcast know, in the last minute of the game, the Chinese team miraculously tied the score and in the final seconds, Qatar committed their 8th team foul, allowing Lin Xinkuan to make two free throws and secure the victory.</p> <p>It was an incredible comeback, a game that no one believed the Chinese team could win.</p> <p>As I watched the game, I noticed that Qatar's initial accuracy was slipping and the Chinese team was gradually maintaining a decent scoring rate from the outside and more aggressively attacking the inside, resulting in more fouls on the Qatar team. And in terms of strategy and passing, the Chinese team became more focused and aggressive, finding ways to score.</p> <p>In terms of physicality, Qatar seemed to be declining while the Chinese team was gritting their teeth and fighting on. In terms of mentality, the Chinese team's strong desire to turn the game around was evident as they continued to trail behind.</p> <p>From watching the game on TV to witnessing the award ceremony, I couldn't help but shout and feel deeply moved.</p> <p>As Coach Xu Jinzhe (who was the commentator for this game) mentioned, the Chinese team's selection strategy was to focus on taller players (around 190cm) who were capable of shooting from the outside. Out of the 8 players who trained together for 6 months before the Asian Games, the final 4 were Lin Xinkuan, Jiang Jun, Yu Xiangping, and Wang Zheyu (of course, the coaching staff played a crucial role as well). The other 4 players also deserve recognition.</p> <p>This game was like life, nothing is impossible. This game sparked heated discussions among fans and most importantly, it showed that in basketball, we are the underdogs, the Mission Impossible. But this team, who was looked down upon domestically and internationally, shattered everyone's expectations.</p> <p>If we were to rationally analyze the factors that contributed to this gold medal victory, it would include the initial selection strategy, the team chemistry, and the players' strong determination and perseverance. But what touched me the most was how this victory by the Chinese team has become an inspiration for all of us, both on and off the court. This is something that we can never get tired of hearing: \"Maybe no one believes in themselves, or they think they have reached their limit. But all choices and actions should come back to ourselves. Never limit yourself, because once you step onto the court, it's an opportunity to give it your all and leave no regrets.\" I believe that in the coming days, there will be more articles and discussions about the legendary performance of the Chinese men's 3x3 basketball team. But for now, I just want to say thank you to the team for showing us the power of teamwork and proving Taiwan's capabilities, and for bringing us so much positive energy.</p>"},{"location":"20231023091131655602/","title":"FIBA World Cup today featured four \"win or go home\" games, with the second game between Brazil and Latvia","text":"<p>FIBA World Cup today featured four \"win or go home\" games, with the second game between Brazil and Latvia.

This not only provides backups for each position but also increases the team's flexibility in terms of rotation.</p> <p>Li Chi-wei has shown his skills during the Jones Cup, being a sharpshooter with accurate outside shots, providing another scoring option for the team. On the other hand, Abassi was previously designated as the sixth man, known for his aggressive play off the bench. How will these two players contribute to the team during the Asian Games? Let's take a closer look.</p> <p>Abassi, originally from Senegal, officially became a local player this year and was immediately called up to the national team. He has performed exceptionally well in the past two professional seasons, earning numerous individual awards and gaining recognition from his peers. He is expected to bring a strong offensive presence to the Chinese team.</p> <p>During the Jones Cup, Abassi fearlessly faced tougher opponents and recorded double-digit points in all four games. He also has a knack for steals and uses his athleticism to score in transition. In the game against Japan, he scored 31 points and had a plus-minus rating of 21, which was his best performance of the tournament.</p> <p>Abassi's excellent off-ball movement is a result of his professional training. His quickness and high release point allow him to shoot efficiently after receiving the ball. He also possesses explosive first-step speed, which compensates for his lack of finesse in his ball-handling skills. Against tougher opponents, he will be a key scorer for the team.</p> <p>However, despite his impressive numbers and contributions to the team, Abassi still needs more opportunities to score due to his inconsistent shooting. This will be a challenge for him on the offensive end.</p> <p>Aside from scoring, Abassi is also a capable playmaker and does not hesitate to share the ball. He is also keen on observing his teammates' movements while attacking, and his ability to stay in the air allows him to find open teammates for passes. With Chen Yingjun out, he may also help with ball-handling duties and relieve some pressure for the team.</p> <p>The Chinese team lacks players who can penetrate and score, making Abassi an essential player in the years to come. His ability to attack the rim will be crucial against tougher opponents and will make him one of the key scorers apart from the CBA trio and naturalized player, Andray Blatche.</p> <p>Li Chi-wei has earned the reputation of being a \"sharpshooter\" since joining the professional league. His height of 192cm gives him a high release point, and he has a consistent and balanced shooting form. He has been a key scorer for both his SBL and T1 teams and has never been called up to the national team until now. This is a perfect opportunity for him to prove himself.</p> <p>During the Jones Cup, Li played in all games except for one against the United States where he did not attempt a shot. In the other games, he averaged 4.5 three-point attempts and made an average of 2 shots, which is a consistent performance for a guard. Even though his scoring numbers may not be as high as the other starters, his ability to stretch the floor and create space for his teammates is valuable. With players like Andray Blatche, Liu Zheng, and Lin Tingqian in the frontcourt, Li's shooting will provide more opportunities for them to attack the basket. </p> <p>Li's positioning becomes even more critical when he is paired with Liu Zheng in pick-and-rolls. As a late addition to the starting lineup, he prevents opponents from easily double-teaming or shrinking their defense, making him the perfect fit for the starting shooting guard/small forward position. However, his main weakness is his lack of impact on the game outside of scoring. His defense is also a weakness, especially against stronger power forwards. He can only contribute as a \"sharpshooter\" and cannot be a reliable 3-and-D player.</p> <p>But with other players who have more skills on the court, Li's job is to hit his shots. Even with limited playing time of around 20 minutes per game, he can still make a significant contribution. In my opinion, Li is the best addition to the team, even though he may have some defensive shortcomings. His height will help improve the team's overall height and make up for their weaknesses in defense and rebounding. He is also a player with a great attitude, always giving his best on the court regardless of the score. From being a bench player to now a starter, his professionalism and dedication deserve a spot on the team.</p> <p>Abassi and Li Chi-wei are both the best supporting players for the Chinese men's basketball team in the Asian Games. From the initial 18-man roster to the current 12, the CBA trio and naturalized player Andray Blatche are the core of the team. Finding suitable players from the domestic league to support them is crucial, especially in terms of offensive firepower. Otherwise, the starters may tire out early in the game, causing them to lose their competitiveness in the crucial moments. Abassi will undoubtedly be the go-to player for offense apart from the core players, while Li's outside shooting can provide the necessary spacing for the team. They will both be the key to the team's success as the sixth men.</p>"},{"location":"20231023091151922893/","title":".

However, the Warriors fought back and closed the gap to only seven points at halftime.

After a rollercoaster first half of the previous season and the return of veteran players in the second half, they managed to secure the championship title and complete a three-peat in the PLG league.</p> <p>This season, the Braves have once again recruited multiple talented players with the goal of achieving a four-peat. Let's take a closer look at their team and their chances for success.</p> <p>The stability of veteran players: As the saying goes, an elderly person in the household is like having a treasure. The Braves have at least three veteran players who continue to be unstoppable forces on the court. Beast Lin Chih-chieh is still a dominant presence and has shown time and time again in the playoffs why he is the number one player in Taiwan.</p> <p>Jet Zhang Zhongxian's sharp drives and consistent performance prove that he still has the ability to dominate the game. And veteran player Tsai Wen-cheng has shown that he can efficiently score when given playing time, even hitting a game-winning shot.</p> <p>As long as these three players are on the Braves, they will be a formidable team to beat. The emergence of mid-generation players: As seen in the previous season, mid-generation players such as Zhang Wen-ping and Hsieh Tsung-jung often play the role of unexpected heroes, helping the team secure crucial victories.</p> <p>Everyone surely remembers Zhang Wen-ping's impressive three-point shot in the championship series that helped the Braves win a crucial game. Hsieh Tsung-jung's performance in the paint was also impressive. If they continue to get playing time this season, they could contribute even more to the team's success.</p> <p>The rise of rookies: The most exciting aspect of the Braves is the emergence of their young players. This season, Jian Ting-zhao, Hong Kai-jie, and Chen Fan-bo-yan all showed promising performances on the Chinese White Team.</p> <p>Jian Ting-zhao and Hong Kai-jie, as the first and second pick for the Chinese White Team, had impressive performances in the Jones Cup, especially Jian Ting-zhao's control of the pace of the game and Hong Kai-jie's ability to drive to the basket. Chen Fan-bo-yan's performance is also worth praising. Despite starting on the bench, he impressed the coaching staff with his accurate three-point shooting and solid defense, earning him a spot in the starting lineup.</p> <p>Chen Fan-bo-yan's incredible talent was already evident in last year's physical tests, and given time, he will surely become a key player for the Braves. Another two promising young players who made it onto the Chinese Blue Team are Zhou Gui-yu and Tseng Hsiang-chun.</p> <p>Tseng Hsiang-chun, a 205cm tall center with a three-point shot, has impressive athleticism and was selected for the Chinese Blue Team, proving his skills. Zhou Gui-yu's lockdown defense on Manny Harris in the championship series was also impressive, and he ultimately made it onto the 18-man roster for the Chinese Blue Team.</p> <p>Zhou Gui-yu's improvement this season is evident, with a more consistent shot, defensive pressure, and ability to drive to the basket, showcasing his potential. With more playing time next season, he will surely reach his full potential.</p> <p>The torch has been passed onto the young players, and the Braves' fans can't wait to see them shine. Re-signing of foreign players: The Braves have also brought back all three of their foreign players this season. These players' individual skills speak for themselves, and their chemistry with the team sets them apart from other teams' foreign players. This is a significant advantage for the Braves.</p> <p>For example, in the semi-finals against the Yulon Dinos, the main player was Ater Majok. But in the championship series against the Taiwan Beer, Coach Hsu chose to pair Johnson with Cuthbert, and they successfully won the championship. This proves that these three foreign players have great chemistry with the team and are crucial to the Braves' success.</p> <p>Off-season reinforcements: This off-season, the Braves first drafted 197cm power forward Cai Zhen-yue, a physically gifted player. They also signed a new foreign player, Shimon, who has been impressive in his highlight reels, showcasing his athleticism.</p> <p>But the most significant reinforcement comes from Dreamers, with the signing of Wu Yung-sheng, a national team level point guard. He fills the gap left by last season's reliance on forwards to handle the ball and will surely integrate well with the team under Coach Hsu's leadership.</p> <p>The best coach in the league: It's impossible to talk about the Braves without mentioning their coach, the self-proclaimed best coach in the league, Hsu Chin-che. He is known for his versatility in tactics and player rotations.</p> <p>He has a keen eye for the game, both on and off the court, and can make quick adjustments. In the previous season's championship series, Coach Hsu perfectly showcased his skills. He used different players in different situations and still managed to get them to perform well, proving why he is the best coach in the league. The only concern: The Braves' only concern is injuries. We must admit that as players age, they become more prone to injuries.</p> <p>The Braves will also face this problem, but their overall team strength is solid, with almost no weaknesses. As long as they can protect their players and not overwork them, they have a good chance of avoiding injuries and securing a four-peat.</p> <p>In conclusion, the Braves have a strong team with a good mix of veterans, mid-generation, and young players, along with an excellent coaching staff.

Campus Ambassadors will receive comprehensive professional training, have the opportunity to experience the league's operations first-hand, and even have the chance to interact with players up close.</p> <p>For the past two seasons, the league has recruited new popular players such as Abasi, Wei Jiahao, Lin Xinkuan, and Gao Jinwei from the University Basketball Association, as well as many young fans. In order to make the league more youthful, expand communication with different groups, and create new connections, the league is holding the Campus Ambassador program for the first time this season. It hopes to combine the unlimited creativity of the new generation and use the Campus Ambassador program to promote league events and content, and attract young people to come and watch the games. T1 League Secretary-General Wang Zhiqun said, \"The general public may find it difficult to imagine how the league operates. Through the Campus Ambassador program, not only can students who are interested in the industry understand the sports industry ecosystem and various positions within the league, but we will also invite well-known professionals to serve as instructors for the Campus Ambassadors and arrange a series of courses for them to experience the real operations from scratch.

This game was full of highlights, starting with the rotation of both teams' foreign players.</p> <p>The Sea Gods had Brookman, Jones, Allen, and Kusas, while the Fubon Braves had Bellfield, Sintil, Johnson, and Shimen.</p> <p>The foreign player configurations of both teams were quite similar, with a ball-handling guard, a scoring foreign player, and two tall players above 210cm. Please continue reading below. In the opening of the game, the Sea Gods fielded Brookman and Kusas, while the Fubon Braves had Johnson and Shimen. In the first half, we could see that the Sea Gods' three-pointers were not accurate, while the Fubon Braves targeted the Sea Gods' weakness - the lack of height at the power forward position - and used it to their advantage.</p> <p>Whenever Brookman was on the court, the Fubon Braves would send a center and a scoring foreign player to play against him. Whether it was Sintil or Johnson, they continuously used mismatches to attack the Sea Gods' defense. The Braves also assigned Zhou Guiyu to defend against Brookman, causing the Sea Gods' offense to struggle in the first half. However, the Sea Gods reacted quickly and towards the end of the second quarter, the coaching staff put in two foreign players at the same time - Allen and Kusas - which had a great effect.</p> <p>In the second half, the Sea Gods' three-pointers started to improve, with Wu Xiaojin's three-point shot piercing through the Braves' defense. Combined with the Braves' three-pointers becoming less accurate, the Sea Gods gradually closed the gap and even took the lead in the third quarter, leading to a back-and-forth battle until the end of the game. In the final minutes, the Sea Gods relied on Brookman's consecutive mid-range shots and a three-pointer from Lu Weiting, who had been specifically called out by Coach Ma Yihong, to seal the victory with a six-point lead.</p> <p>In fact, the key point of this game was the decisions made by both coaching staffs. With similar foreign player configurations, the Braves' tactic was to use mismatches and not field foreign players in the same position, instead using local players to limit Brookman, while letting Johnson and Sintil score heavily.</p> <p>On the other hand, the Sea Gods had two tactics. The first was to go head-to-head against the Braves. For example, if the Braves fielded Johnson and Shimen, the Sea Gods would use Allen and Kusas, with Jones playing against Sintil and Brookman defending against Bellfield.</p> <p>But using this tactic resulted in a stalemate, with neither team able to gain an advantage. So the Sea Gods chose the second tactic, which was to target Sintil. Whenever the Braves fielded Sintil, the Sea Gods would put in two tall foreign players, using Qiu Zixuan to defend against Sintil. Please continue reading below. In this situation, it's like whoever's head breaks first will determine the outcome - whether it's the Braves' power forward or the Sea Gods' small forward. In the end, it was a close call, with neither team able to fully contain the other, but the Sea Gods ultimately secured the victory, thanks to their improved performance in the second half.</p> <p>The second game saw the Dream Team defeat the CTBC Brothers with a score of 107:101. As for the Brothers, they were missing Lin Wei-han, Abbasi, and Zeng Wendong in their starting lineup, and their foreign player Ed was not registered. Xie Yaxuan also didn't have much playing time, causing their overall offense to be dismal and their team coordination to be non-existent. Their once-praised passing game was also lacking. The first half was relatively normal, but in the second half, their entire team seemed to malfunction, not knowing what they were playing for.</p> <p>On the other hand, the Dream Team played with great organization and precision. They attacked inside when necessary and were not hesitant to take outside shots, with their three-pointers being especially accurate. Lin Junji, despite being defended by the Brothers, still managed to constantly break through and tear apart their defense, scoring 25 points and leading the Dream Team to victory.</p> <p>The Dream Team's foreign player rotation was interesting, with two players being paired together - Gilbert and Bezani, Blue and McCulloch - providing both height and scoring power, and performing exceptionally well.</p> <p>In addition, local forward Xin Woke put on a stellar performance, being able to shoot from the outside and score inside, completely suppressing the Brothers' small forwards. From today's game, we can see that it's a good thing for the two leagues to have exchanges, as it allows for different playing styles and helps improve our own game. Let's look forward to the second day of games together.</p>"},{"location":"20231024091149791828/","title":"According to Adrian Wojnarowski, there has been no progress between Klay Thompson and the Warriors on contract negotiations, and there is a significant gap between the two sides in terms of contract length and amount","text":"<p>According to Adrian Wojnarowski, there has been no progress between Klay Thompson and the Warriors on contract negotiations, and there is a significant gap between the two sides in terms of contract length and amount.

Haynes even pointed out in the end of the report that when the trade was announced, Giannis was the first to send a text message to Lillard, writing, \"Let's go win that X championship together!\"</p>"},{"location":"20231024091216339973/","title":"\u300c\u6211\u5011\u5f88\u9ad8\u8208\u5ba3\u5e03\u856d\u9806\u8b70\u5c07\u64d4\u4efb\u653b\u57ce\u7345\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u968a\u9577\uff0c\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u65bd\u984f\u5b97\u5c07\u64d4\u4efb\u526f\u968a\u9577\u3002\u856d\u9806\u8b70\u5728\u7403\u968a\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u9818\u5c0e\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c08\u696d\u7cbe\u795e\u5c07\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u5e36\u4f86\u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u3002\u65bd\u984f\u5b97\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u5e74\u8f15\u4e14\u6709\u6d3b\u529b\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u76f8\u4fe1\u4ed6\u5c07\u5728\u7403\u968a\u4e2d\u767c\u63ee\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u6211\u5011\u671f\u5f85\u8457\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u958b\u59cb\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u7403\u968a\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u9818\u5c0e\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6210\u7e3e\u3002\u300d","text":"<p>\u653b\u57ce\u7345\u4e5f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u5c07\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5805\u6301\u4ee5\u300c\u6c38\u4e0d\u653e\u68c4\u3001\u5718\u7d50\u4e00\u5fc3\u300d\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\uff0c\u5e36\u9818\u7403\u968a\u671d\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u524d\u9032\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4e5f\u611f\u8b1d\u4e0a\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u6b63\u526f\u968a\u9577\u9ad8\u570b\u8c6a\u548c\u856d\u9806\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u7403\u968a\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e36\u9818\u7403\u968a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0d\u932f\u7684\u6210\u7e3e\u3002</p> <p>\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u653b\u57ce\u7345\u5c07\u5728\u856d\u9806\u8b70\u548c\u65bd\u984f\u5b97\u7684\u5e36\u9818\u4e0b\uff0c\u7e7c\u7e8c\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u8fce\u63a5\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u671f\u5f85\u4ed6\u5011\u5e36\u7d66\u6211\u5011\u66f4\u7cbe\u5f69\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u5427\uff01   \u300c\u6211\u5011\u5f88\u9ad8\u8208\u5ba3\u5e03\u856d\u9806\u8b70\u5c07\u64d4\u4efb\u653b\u57ce\u7345\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u968a\u9577\uff0c\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u65bd\u984f\u5b97\u5c07\u64d4\u4efb\u526f\u968a\u9577\u3002\u856d\u9806\u8b70\u5728\u7403\u968a\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u9818\u5c0e\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c08\u696d\u7cbe\u795e\u5c07\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u5e36\u4f86\u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u3002\u65bd\u984f\u5b97\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u5e74\u8f15\u4e14\u6709\u6d3b\u529b\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u76f8\u4fe1\u4ed6\u5c07\u5728\u7403\u968a\u4e2d\u767c\u63ee\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u6211\u5011\u671f\u5f85\u8457\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u958b\u59cb\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u7403\u968a\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u9818\u5c0e\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6210\u7e3e\u3002\u300d</p> <p>\u653b\u57ce\u7345\u4e5f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u5c07\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5805\u6301\u4ee5\u300c\u6c38\u4e0d\u653e\u68c4\u3001\u5718\u7d50\u4e00\u5fc3\u300d\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\uff0c\u5e36\u9818\u7403\u968a\u671d\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u524d\u9032\u3002\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4e5f\u611f\u8b1d\u4e0a\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u6b63\u526f\u968a\u9577\u9ad8\u570b\u8c6a\u548c\u856d\u9806\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u7403\u968a\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u8457\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e36\u9818\u7403\u968a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0d\u932f\u7684\u6210\u7e3e\u3002</p> <p>\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u7684\u653b\u57ce\u7345\u5c07\u5728\u856d\u9806\u8b70\u548c\u65bd\u984f\u5b97\u7684\u5e36\u9818\u4e0b\uff0c\u7e7c\u7e8c\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u8fce\u63a5\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u671f\u5f85\u4ed6\u5011\u5e36\u7d66\u6211\u5011\u66f4\u7cbe\u5f69\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u5427\uff01</p>"},{"location":"20231025091132556264/","title":"Cross-League Basketball Tournament - Taiwan Beer's Lin Bing-Sheng Denies Being the Best Player on the Team","text":"<p>September 17, 2023, 7:35pm - United Daily News/ Reporter: Zeng Si-Ru/ Immediate Report Lin Bing-Sheng (right) scored the highest for the entire team, with 24 points in two consecutive days for Taiwan Beer's \"God of War\" title    Cross-League Basketball Tournament - Taiwan Beer's Lin Bing-Sheng Denies Being the Best Player on the Team</p> <p>September 17, 2023, 7:35pm - United Daily News/ Reporter: Zeng Si-Ru/ Immediate Report Lin Bing-Sheng (right) scored the highest for the entire team, with 24 points in two consecutive days for Taiwan Beer's \"God of War\" title.</p> <p>Photo/ Provided by Chinese Basketball Association Taiwan Beer, who was behind by half in the first half, was led by \"Sun Wukong\" Lin Bing-Sheng, who scored 24 points in the Cross-League Basketball Invitational Tournament today. They made a comeback in the second half and defeated Taiwan Beer 80:71, securing their second consecutive win. Lin Bing-Sheng, who had the highest score for the team for two consecutive days, attributed the victory to the team and stressed that there is no \"best player\" on the team. Despite facing contract disputes with PLG Hsinchu Street's \"Lion of Attack\", Lin Bing-Sheng remained unfazed on the court. In the first half, the God of War was still behind with a score of 33:36. In the first five and a half minutes of the third quarter, they made an 11:1 offensive to take the lead, with Lin Bing-Sheng scoring 9 points in this aggressive attack.</p> <p>In the final quarter, Taiwan Beer found their rhythm, with Yang Tian-You and Wang Xin-Wei's consecutive three-pointers giving them an advantage. However, in the last 23 seconds, Taiwan Beer's guard Cao Xun-Xiang was called out again, and Wang Hao-Ji made a free throw and a buzzer-beating three-pointer from the bottom corner, allowing Taiwan Beer to lead 58:51 after the third quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, the God of War scored 29 points and made a comeback, defeating Taiwan Beer. Lin Bing-Sheng was the highest scorer for two consecutive games and his popularity is currently high, giving off the aura of a \"best player\" on the team. The God of War's American head coach Brian Adams also said that Lin Bing-Sheng has leadership qualities off the court and his dominance on the court can inspire his teammates. He is indeed an important player on the team and one of the leaders. However, he also emphasized that they are a team and do not focus on individuals. Everyone can lead the team.</p> <p>Lin Bing-Sheng agreed, saying that every teammate is important. \"A good team does not have a best player. If a team only has one best player, it will not be able to win a championship.\"</p> <p>He also mentioned his teammates, including Liu Yan-Ting's defense, Lin Li's full-court press, and Cao Xun-Xiang's momentum. Everyone played a crucial role in today's comeback win. He hopes that they can continue to play to their strengths and help the team. Cao Xun-Xiang, who received a technical foul today, played for Taiwan Beer's \"Bear of England\" last season. He said that there is no anger when facing his former teammates, but he does have some opinions on the unfavorable calls made by the referees. He only reacted strongly because of the unfair calls, leading to his ejection. He also mentioned that the new head coach joined the team only two weeks ago, so they haven't had much time to work on team chemistry. They are currently playing based on instinct, and they still need to continue to gel with their new teammates.</p>"},{"location":"20231025091141020607/","title":"Introducing the Teams of the Chao Yao Cup: Ohka Gakuen High School from Japan","text":"<p>In the 2021 FIBA Asia Cup Women's Basketball Tournament, Japan defeated China to win their fifth consecutive championship   Introducing the Teams of the Chao Yao Cup: Ohka Gakuen High School from Japan</p> <p>In the 2021 FIBA Asia Cup Women's Basketball Tournament, Japan defeated China to win their fifth consecutive championship. They also made history by winning a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics. This is a testament to the success of Japan's \"Sports Promotion Plan,\" which was implemented in 2013 and has brought about significant and even astonishing results in both professional and student development. It has become a model worth emulating.</p> <p>This year, the Chao Yao Cup International Team invited Ohka Gakuen High School, a renowned breeding ground for Japan's new generation of women's basketball players. The school has been a dominant force in Japan's high school women's basketball scene and has produced numerous top players. Their innovative and dynamic style of play has shattered the stereotype of Asian basketball players being at a physical disadvantage. They have won a total of 71 national titles, including the most wins in the Japan Winter Cup (24), the highest single-game score in the women's division (139 points), the most wins in the Inter-High basketball tournament (25), and 22 titles and five consecutive championships in the National Sports Festival. They also achieved a legendary score of \"268:0\" against their opponent, Toyohashi High School, in the 2014 Aichi Prefecture qualifier for the Inter-High tournament.</p> <p>Ohka Gakuen High School, the undisputed \"factory\" for producing Japan's national team players, has not only established a dynasty in high school women's basketball in Japan, but also cultivated many top players in the international basketball scene. These include WNBA's former Seattle Storm center Ramu Tokashiki, 2020 Olympic silver medalists Maki Takada and Nanaho Miyoshi, Japanese-Ghanaian \"Mango sisters\" Evelyn and Stephanie Mawuli, and WNBA's former Phoenix Mercury player and newly announced inductee into the FIBA Hall of Fame for 2021, Yuko Oshima. Maki Takada, a key player in Japan's silver medal-winning team at the Tokyo Olympics, is a graduate of Ohka Gakuen High School.</p> <p>The team has a wealth of international experience and has been actively participating in international exchanges prior to the pandemic. In 2017, they won the Grandmas' Cup in Taiwan with five consecutive victories, and in 2018, they formed a strong bond with Taipei Yangming High School in the Yangming Cup International Women's Basketball Invitational Tournament. This year, they will once again come to Taiwan to participate in the Chao Yao Cup, with a lineup that includes co-captains Kokoro Kurokawa and Kokoro Tanaka, and \"Asian prodigy\" center Rina Fukuo. In addition, four new freshmen, Nana Nagahamada, Mina Abe, Anri Kanazawa, and Sakura Yamada, were also key players in Japan's U16 Asia Youth team that defeated Taiwan's women's basketball team by 47 points.</p> <p>What kind of \"education\" will this team, with such a wealth of international experience, bring to the Taiwanese women's basketball players? It is something to look forward to.</p> <p>The Ohka Gakuen High School team, which has confirmed its participation in the Chao Yao Cup this year, has already expressed to the organizers that they are excited to once again participate in international exchanges and competitions after the pandemic. They are looking forward to seeing and absorbing the strengths of other countries and incorporating them into their own \"new Japanese style\" of basketball, which will make them even more competitive on the world stage.</p> <p>As the current top team in Japan, will they be able to rise even higher and become a more influential breeding ground for student players on the international basketball stage? This is a goal and milestone that is certainly within their reach. </p>"},{"location":"20231025091149153544/","title":"According to reporter Jason Dumas, sources revealed that Dwight Howard has completed his two-day interview process with the Warriors","text":"<p>According to reporter Jason Dumas, sources revealed that Dwight Howard has completed his two-day interview process with the Warriors.</p> <p>The Warriors will make a decision as soon as today on whether or not to sign Howard.

Afterwards, Green retweeted the news and commented, \"Someday, someday, nothing will be leaked. Someday. By the way, Jason, you're good. But someday, nothing will be leaked. I have a dream.\" Green's comment has a reason behind it, as the rumors and video of him punching Poole were leaked by an internal source.

The reporter then asked if head coach Popovich had yelled at Wembanyama, to which Wembanyama replied, \"Of course, but a little later than I expected. I am grateful that he yelled at me.\"</p> <p>Wembanyama also mentioned the fast pace of NBA training, saying that the team's training teaches them a lot of information and tactical principles that he has never seen before. He must be very focused to not miss what the team is teaching. If you lose focus for just one second, you won't know what you're doing for the next 15 minutes.</p> <p>In another interview, Wembanyama also talked about the great logistical support in the NBA. He said that last year, he had to worry about a lot of things, but this year, he has less to worry about. Last year, he was not just a player, but also a GM.

At that time, I was glad that Taiwan could still have a professional basketball league in the final stage of these talented players' careers. It allowed this group of the most talented players in Taiwan basketball history to stand on the professional stage.</p> <p>Unfortunately, before Tan Lei announced his retirement, he only played two games on this stage. Looking back now, it's really a regrettable thing.</p> <p>To commemorate Tan Lei's retirement, I decided to carefully organize his more than 20 years of career records. Of course, Tan Lei's career is too illustrious, and it is difficult to cover all of his experiences in one article. Therefore, in this article, I want to focus on his contributions in international competitions and explain his high school glory as part of the Three Ming Five Tigers, his impressive records in the SBL, his experience in the NBA Summer League, and his performance in the later CBA and ABL. Let others fill in the rest! Please continue reading to review Tan Lei's international career. It will take a lot of space to review Tan Lei's experience representing Chinese National Team in international competitions. He has been a key player in almost all the international competitions of the \"golden generation\" from 2001, when they started winning silver, to the unfortunate ending of the 2015 Asian Championship with the worst record in history. Below, I have compiled a list of the various international competitions that Tan Lei has participated in and the final results.

In order to secure the second place in the group, the Chinese team will have to defeat Mongolia in their final group stage match. Team captain Zeng Wendong has directly declared a \"must-win order,\" while coach Sang Maosen pointed out the key points for the upcoming game.</p> <p>Sang Maosen mentioned that the opponent China faced today, China, had an absolute height advantage. In order to protect the inside, the Chinese team focused on defense, but they missed out on several defensive rebounds, allowing the opponent to score from the outside. He added, \"The biggest problem for us is that every player was marked tightly on offense, making it difficult to create opportunities.\" Despite losing by a 20-point margin, Sang Maosen still praised the Chinese team's fighting spirit, but there is still room for improvement in their defensive communication and rotation. The Asian Games men's basketball tournament has a total of 16 teams participating, divided into four groups in the preliminary round. The group winners will advance directly to the quarterfinals, while the second and third place teams will compete in crossover matches for the remaining four spots. China will face Mongolia in their final group stage match, and a victory will secure their second place in the group.</p> <p>The Chinese team does not have much knowledge about Mongolia, but they have done their homework based on Mongolia's previous game against China. Sang Maosen believes that their opponents in the next game are very active and have a positive attitude. Although China had a disadvantage in size today, they may have an advantage in the next game against Mongolia. In order to have a chance to play to their strengths, the Chinese team will have to guard the rebounds well and execute their signature transition offense.</p> <p>Mongolia also played against Hong Kong at the same time today, but they suffered their second consecutive defeat with a score of 64-69. Hong Kong, who replaced Lebanon in the Asian Games, started with a win. Currently, both Hong Kong and China have a record of 1 win and 1 loss. In terms of strength, it will be difficult for Hong Kong to upset the host in their final match, which means that the Chinese team, who defeated Hong Kong in their first game, has almost secured the second place in the group.</p>"},{"location":"20231025091219979113/","title":"Shaq on NBA Expansion Team in Las Vegas","text":"<p>NBA expansion team has been a hot topic recently, with Las Vegas and Seattle being the top contenders for the potential city to host the team    Shaq on NBA Expansion Team in Las Vegas</p> <p>NBA expansion team has been a hot topic recently, with Las Vegas and Seattle being the top contenders for the potential city to host the team.

He will be replaced by Luca Banchi, the current coach of the Latvian national team. This decision has caused quite a stir before the start of the new season.</p> <p>Scariolo's dismissal was surprising in timing, as his relationship with the team has been strained for a long time. It is rumored that external interference has been affecting the team's performance. Scariolo was considered a top candidate for the head coach position of the Toronto Raptors, and even had a video conference with them during the Italian league championship series. The breaking point came when the team's budget was reduced, as the European league implemented a financial fair play policy, forcing Bologna to significantly cut their budget and release several players whose contracts had expired.</p> <p>During a press conference on Wednesday (September 13th), Scariolo's words sparked a lot of discussion. He stated that the team's roster decisions were mostly made by the club and refused to answer questions about the team's goals for the new season, saying they should be directed to the management. However, after hearing these remarks, most of Bologna's shareholders were dissatisfied and decided to dismiss the coach. According to internal sources, almost everyone in the club believed that Scariolo would be fired. On Friday morning, Bologna released a press release announcing the termination of Scariolo's contract. The press release also stated that Scariolo's remarks to the media on September 13th, 2023, and his statements at a press conference after the end of the season on June 27th, were major reasons for his dismissal.</p> <p>After firing Scariolo, Bologna quickly announced that they had reached an agreement with Luca Banchi to be the new head coach, with a two-year contract.</p> <p>Banchi has previously served as head coach for several teams, including Siena and EA7 Emporio Armani Milan. He led Latvia to a fifth-place finish at this year's World Cup and was awarded the Best Coach award.</p> <p>Interestingly, Banchi's Latvia team had faced Scariolo's Spanish team in the World Cup, with Latvia ultimately winning and keeping Spain out of the quarter-finals. This sudden change in European basketball coaching has sparked widespread discussion among the public.</p>"},{"location":"20231026091136713085/","title":"According to Yahoo reporters Jake Fischer and Adrian Wojnarowski, the Portland Trail Blazers are considering acquiring Deandre Ayton from the Phoenix Suns in a potential trade involving Damian Lillard","text":"<p>According to Yahoo reporters Jake Fischer and Adrian Wojnarowski, the Portland Trail Blazers are considering acquiring Deandre Ayton from the Phoenix Suns in a potential trade involving Damian Lillard.

The Blazers are seriously considering acquiring Ayton as part of a package for Lillard.</p> <p>Fischer states, \"According to my sources, the Blazers are strongly considering acquiring Ayton as part of a package for Lillard, and this has been reported by local Phoenix media outlets Arizona Sport and PHNX.\" However, Fischer also notes that the difficulty in acquiring Ayton is not what the Blazers can offer for Lillard, but rather the fact that they would also have to part ways with Jusuf Nurkic. Additionally, the Suns' new head coach Frank Vogel may require a center to execute his tactical plans.</p> <p>The Raptors are reportedly considering sending Pascal Siakam, OG Anunoby, and other young players in a potential trade, but their remaining contracts of 1 and 2 years, respectively, may be a concern for the Blazers, who also have Jerami Grant on a newly signed big contract playing the same position. The Bulls have been trying to trade Zach LaVine this summer, but have found no buyers, and the Blazers have young players such as Scoot Henderson, Shaedon Sharpe, and Anfernee Simons that they want to develop, leaving little room for LaVine.</p> <p>Finally, the Jazz, Nets, Hornets, and Bulls have also been mentioned as potential trade partners, with Fischer reporting that the Heat are still involved in discussions and Tyler Herro is a player they would be willing to trade in a potential deal. However, Wojnarowski notes on his show that while there have been reports of progress, no deal is imminent, and there are multiple teams vying for Lillard's services. The Blazers are actively working on a trade and hope to complete it before training camp. As of now, the reason for no further progress in the talks is that the Heat are not involved, but as we all know, one move can change the entire dynamic of a trade.</p>"},{"location":"20231026091141700985/","title":"JJ Redick has been invited twice to serve as an assistant coach for the Celtics, but has rejected the team's invitation","text":"<p>JJ Redick has been invited twice to serve as an assistant coach for the Celtics, but has rejected the team's invitation.</p> <p>Photo/Reuters</p> <p>Former NBA player JJ Redick recently invited Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla to his podcast \"Old Man and the Three podcast.\" In the hour-long program, Mazzulla mentioned that he had invited Redick to join the Celtics coaching staff twice last year.</p> <p>At the time, due to former head coach Ime Udoka's situation, Mazzulla was appointed as the acting head coach and was looking to build his own coaching team. He reached out to Redick, who was in the Boston area at the time, but Redick declined the invitation. In the podcast, Mazzulla mentioned that at the time, he suddenly found himself as the acting head coach and only had one week to find his assistant coaching staff. He reached out to Redick, who happened to be nearby, and the two discussed the matter on the golf course. Mazzulla specifically mentioned that he thought Redick had a chance to become an assistant coach, but time was too tight, and he only had about two days to consider. Redick considered his family and current job, and ultimately did not join the coaching staff.</p> <p>In March, one of the Celtics assistant coaches, Damon Stoudamire, left to become a college head coach. Mazzulla and the team invited Redick to become an assistant coach again, but Redick still declined. Redick's current job is still a commentator for ESPN, but according to reports, the Raptors also interviewed him for their head coaching position this year, but ultimately chose another candidate

Fubon entered the second half with a double-digit lead, but the Jets, led by superstar Yuki Mitsukashi, kept the score close.

After making it to the Eastern Conference playoffs as a top six team the previous year, they even managed to put up a fight against the 76ers in a six-game series despite being plagued with injuries. However, with all their key players returning, the Raptors only managed to finish as the ninth seed in the East, and were even embarrassed by losing their first play-in game to the Bulls.</p> <p>The season was full of ups and downs, with the team often blowing leads in the fourth quarter and reports of locker room disputes.</p> <p>In the end, with the team's underwhelming performance, head coach Nick Nurse left and longtime starting point guard Fred VanVleet departed for Houston, signaling the start of a new era for the Raptors.</p> <p>Please continue reading for a breakdown of the team's roster changes:</p> <p>In Out Dennis Schr\u00f6der Fred VanVleet Jalen McDaniels Gradey Dick Dalano Banton Will Barton Garrett Temple </p> <p>Key Players Please continue reading for a breakdown of the team's key players:</p> <p>With the confirmation of Darko Rajakovic as the team's head coach, the Raptors are expected to play a different style of offense in the upcoming season.</p> <p>Under Nurse, the team's offense relied heavily on creating mismatches for their star players to score, resulting in players like Pascal Siakam and VanVleet dominating the ball and other players standing around waiting for passes.</p> <p>However, Rajakovic, although inexperienced in the NBA, has shown in preseason games that his offense will focus on \"spacing\" and \"ball movement.\"</p> <p>In the preseason, the Raptors have often used a 5-out formation, with even center Jakob Poeltl stationed on the perimeter despite not being a threat from outside. Rajakovic has designed numerous weak-side handoffs to create open shots for his players, taking advantage of Poeltl's screening abilities. This has become the team's main offensive strategy, with the ball constantly moving and players finding the best opportunities to shoot.</p> <p>On the defensive end, the team struggled with their switching defense in the past few seasons, but with the addition of Poeltl, they now have more flexibility on that end of the floor. Poeltl is skilled at both hedging on pick-and-rolls and dropping back to defend the paint, reminiscent of former Raptor Marc Gasol. His presence in the paint is also a great deterrent for opposing players.</p> <p>Although the team lost VanVleet, who was known for his strong defense despite his height, Schr\u00f6der is also adept at navigating screens, making for a seamless transition in defensive strategies.</p> <p>Additionally, with their focus on stockpiling big men, the team acquired McDaniels, who has shown promise on both ends of the court in the preseason. </p> <p>Weaknesses While the title mentions weaknesses for the upcoming season, this has been a recurring issue for the Raptors for the past few years, which is their three-point shooting.</p> <p>Last season, the team shot a dismal 33.5% from beyond the arc, ranking third worst in the league. Only Anunoby and Gary Trent Jr. were consistent threats from the perimeter, leading to a lack of space for the big men to cut into.</p> <p>The team only acquired one of the best shooters in this year's draft, Dick, who shot over 40% from three in college. However, it remains to be seen if he can quickly adapt to the longer NBA three-point line and the faster defense, as he struggled in the summer league, shooting only 29.6% from three.</p> <p>Furthermore, the team can only hope for a comeback from Otto Porter Jr., who has been injured for almost a year. On a different note, with the coaching staff undergoing changes and a more fluid offensive system, the team's former top players like Siakam will have to adjust to sharing the ball more. Although Siakam started his career as a hustle player without the ball, he has grown accustomed to being the primary scorer for the team. It will be interesting to see how he adapts to a different pace and continues to use his versatile skillset and improved passing to help the team. </p> <p>Key Variables The most crucial variable for the upcoming season will be the front office. Despite usually having a relaxed and jovial media day, there was a sense of unease this year. Both Siakam and Anunoby have been the subject of trade rumors, and with the team's focus seemingly shifting towards building around Barnes, it is possible that neither player will remain on the team by the end of the season. As a versatile player who can contribute on both ends of the court, Siakam's skills are a luxury for a team looking to make a championship push, while Anunoby's elite defense and consistent three-point shooting make him a valuable asset for any playoff team.</p> <p>Moreover, the team may also look to acquire another impact player through trades to help Barnes and Poeltl lead the team. Overall, the 2022-23 season will not only be a fresh start for the Raptors but also a season full of uncertainties and challenges.

between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers, Jaylen Brown was noticed by commentators for wearing his shorts backwards. This was a funny moment during the game as the commentators joked about who would tell him about his mistake. Despite the wardrobe mishap, Brown still managed to contribute 19 points to the Celtics' victory over the 76ers. The Celtics' key players, including newly signed Payton Pritchard who scored a team-high of 24 points, all played in the game and secured the team's first pre-season win. The commentator also mentioned that he had never seen a player wear their shorts backwards before and only noticed because he saw the Celtics' logo on the back. </p>"},{"location":"20231027091145555591/","title":"\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u5c55\u671b\u4e0a\u5b63\u7368\u884c\u4fe0\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4e0d\u5982\u9810\u671f\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\u7684\u5927\u9580\u5df2\u7d93\u6253\u958b\uff0c\u7403\u968a\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u65b0\u9762\u5b54\u548c\u65b0\u6c23\u8c61\u3002\u96a8\u8457 Doncic \u548c Irving \u7684\u9818\u5c0e\uff0c\u7368\u884c\u4fe0\u5c07\u52aa\u529b\u91cd\u8fd4\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\uff0c\u4e26\u91cd\u65b0\u5851\u9020\u7403\u968a\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u3002\u672c\u5b63\u7684\u91cd\u9ede\u5c07\u653e\u5728\u7403\u54e1\u9593\u7684\u78e8\u5408\u548c\u65b0\u9ad4\u7cfb\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u8981\u89e3\u6c7a\u7c43\u677f\u548c\u8b77\u6846\u7b49\u8001\u554f\u984c\u3002\u671f\u5f85\u7368\u884c\u4fe0\u5728\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\u80fd\u5920\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u3002","text":"<p>\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u5c55\u671b\u4e0a\u5b63\u7368\u884c\u4fe0\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4e0d\u5982\u9810\u671f\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\u7684\u5927\u9580\u5df2\u7d93\u6253\u958b\uff0c\u7403\u968a\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u65b0\u9762\u5b54\u548c\u65b0\u6c23\u8c61\u3002\u96a8\u8457 Doncic \u548c Irving \u7684\u9818\u5c0e\uff0c\u7368\u884c\u4fe0\u5c07\u52aa\u529b\u91cd\u8fd4\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\uff0c\u4e26\u91cd\u65b0\u5851\u9020\u7403\u968a\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u3002\u672c\u5b63\u7684\u91cd\u9ede\u5c07\u653e\u5728\u7403\u54e1\u9593\u7684\u78e8\u5408\u548c\u65b0\u9ad4\u7cfb\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u8981\u89e3\u6c7a\u7c43\u677f\u548c\u8b77\u6846\u7b49\u8001\u554f\u984c\u3002\u671f\u5f85\u7368\u884c\u4fe0\u5728\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\u80fd\u5920\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231027091147983232/","title":"\u7e3d\u7684\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u5deb\u5e2b\u9019\u500b\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\uff0c\u5c07\u6703\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8d77\u9ede\uff0c\u96a8\u8457Beal\u7684\u96e2\u53bb\uff0c\u5deb\u5e2b\u4e5f\u6b63\u5f0f\u9032\u5165\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\uff0c\u9664\u4e86Kuzma\u8ddfPoole\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4e5f\u6709\u4e0d\u5c11\u65b0\u7684\u7403\u54e1\u52a0\u5165\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u662f\u5e74\u8f15\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u4ecd\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u6642\u9593\u4f86\u5efa\u7acb\u8d77\u4e00\u652f\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u4e26\u627e\u5230\u5408\u9069\u7684\u6230\u8853\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5deb\u5e2b\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u91cd\u56de\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u821e\u53f0\u3002","text":"<p>\u7e3d\u7684\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u5deb\u5e2b\u9019\u500b\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\uff0c\u5c07\u6703\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8d77\u9ede\uff0c\u96a8\u8457Beal\u7684\u96e2\u53bb\uff0c\u5deb\u5e2b\u4e5f\u6b63\u5f0f\u9032\u5165\u65b0\u6642\u4ee3\uff0c\u9664\u4e86Kuzma\u8ddfPoole\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4e5f\u6709\u4e0d\u5c11\u65b0\u7684\u7403\u54e1\u52a0\u5165\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u662f\u5e74\u8f15\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u4ecd\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u6642\u9593\u4f86\u5efa\u7acb\u8d77\u4e00\u652f\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u4e26\u627e\u5230\u5408\u9069\u7684\u6230\u8853\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5deb\u5e2b\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u91cd\u56de\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u821e\u53f0\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231027091150917203/","title":"Image/FIBA World Cup On the last day of the round of 16, two undefeated European teams, Germany and Slovenia, faced off in a game that did not determine who would advance to the quarterfinals, but rather who would be first or second in their group","text":"<p>Image/FIBA World Cup On the last day of the round of 16, two undefeated European teams, Germany and Slovenia, faced off in a game that did not determine who would advance to the quarterfinals, but rather who would be first or second in their group.

Don't just know about puffy skirts and call everything a beef market.

As I mentioned in my previous discussion about Harden's future with the 76ers, both sides do not have much disagreement about his desire to leave.</p> <p>Harden doesn't need to use technical absences from team activities to pressure Morey, and it's also not Morey's wish to keep him. A breakup is inevitable. However, even if the 76ers' front office wants to be the bigger person and trade Harden, the 34-year-old may find himself in a difficult situation. By choosing to absent himself from media day and the first day of training camp, Harden is making a statement that is unnecessary.</p> <p>[Can the Beard blow away?] Where will he go? How about Hawaii! But Morey is also unlikely to sell Harden at a cheap price. From the perspective of the 76ers' front office, their star player Joel Embiid still has four years left on his contract, while both Harden and Tobias Harris only have one year left. The Bucks and Celtics, the main competitors in the Eastern Conference, have strengthened their roster, and the Heat still has Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo leading the team. Even the Greek Freak is still with the team.</p> <p>Philadelphia's strategy of waiting for the right opportunity may not work. If they want to keep Embiid and maintain their chances of winning the championship, they must get corresponding assets in return for Harden.</p> <p>Rumors say that the trade is stuck because Morey is asking for too much, but that's not fair. Let's look at it from the perspective of the 76ers' front office. Their newly crowned Most Valuable Player \"Pencil Brother\" Joel Embiid still has four years left on his contract, while their two main players, Harden and Tobias Harris, only have one year left. The Bucks and Celtics, the main competitors in the Eastern Conference, have strengthened their roster, and the Heat still has Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo leading the team, while Giannis Antetokounmpo is still with the team.</p> <p>Philadelphia wants to take a wait-and-see approach, but it's probably not the best option. They must get corresponding assets in return for Harden, which is fundamentally different from how they handled the situation with Ben Simmons last year.</p> <p>Luckily, they handled the \"Simmons blowing incident\" well and eventually landed Harden. [Can the Beard blow away?] Where will he go? How about Hawaii! The situation with Harden is different.</p> <p>He wants to play for his hometown Los Angeles, and the only team that \"might\" be willing to help him fulfill his dream is the Clippers, but their \"willingness\" may not be very high. After all, it's Harden who wants to go, not the Clippers who must have him.</p> <p>The Clippers' problem is that they don't have many players (or potential assets) that they can trade, unless the 76ers are just looking to save money or get draft picks (they still have the Clippers' first-round picks from 2027 to 2030). Without giving up either Kawhi Leonard or Paul George, the Clippers may have to offer Robert Covington, who will turn 33 by the end of the year and underwent ACL surgery on his right knee in late August. He only played 12 minutes in 5 playoff games and, despite being in a contract year, the 76ers may not benefit much from getting him back. Even if they include a former Raptor and member of the 2019 championship team Norman Powell, it doesn't seem like a very enticing package.</p> <p>The other assets with trading value include the young guard Bones Hyland, the center Ivica Zubac, or the wing Terance Mann that they acquired from the Nuggets. All of them are usable, but I'm not sure if Embiid will be satisfied. If the 76ers can accept Covington+Powell+Mann/Zubac, plus a first-round pick and a bench player to balance salaries, the Clippers' bench depth will certainly be affected, and it depends on whether they are willing to take that risk. If they really want to bet, it's uncertain if Covington would be the main course, and a third or fourth team may have to be involved in the trade. The more options on the table, the more attractive the deal may be, increasing the chances that Morey will pull the trigger. If they keep serving the same dish, they may end up getting rejected. Of course, it may be better if they don't trade at all. After all, the Clippers' main enemy is staying healthy, and the NBA's new resting rules... (?)[Can the Beard blow away?] Where will he go?

When asked about his teammate's absence from training, Joel Embiid said that Harden may have \"something to do\". Since this summer, Harden has been trying to leave Philadelphia. It was reported that he was frustrated when the team's basketball operations president Morey did not immediately offer him a maximum contract. Harden then chose to exercise his player option for one year.</p> <p>It was reported that immediately after choosing this option, Harden requested a trade to the Los Angeles Clippers. But Morey has been very passive in the trade and seems to be dragging it out.

However, the return they received in trades may still keep the team competitive. In the three-way trade involving Lillard, the Blazers not only gave up Lillard, but also several key players (Jusuf Nurkic, Nassir Little, Keon Johnson). Many believe that the Blazers will face a long rebuilding process and produce disappointing results like other teams towards the bottom of the league, hoping to secure the top draft pick and rebuild the team's ability to compete for the playoffs.</p> <p>However, after examining the players the Blazers received in exchange, it may be too early to assume that they will be a tanking team next season. Please continue reading to see how the trade with the Bucks for Jrue Holiday, and then to the Celtics, may have been a smart move for the Blazers. Not only did they secure the team's future, but they also improved their present.</p> <p>Trail Blazers' general manager Joe Cronin's strategy was excellent, as he worked tirelessly to minimize the impact of Lillard's trade request, which initially only included the Heat.</p> <p>The following are the players, draft picks, and pick swap rights that the Blazers received in the Lillard-Holiday trade: Players: Deandre Ayton, Robert Williams III, Malcolm Brogdon, Toumani Camara Draft picks: 2024 Warriors' first-round pick (top four protected), 2029 Bucks' unprotected first-round pick, 2029 Celtics' unprotected first-round pick Pick swap rights: 2028 Bucks' first-round pick swap rights, 2030 Bucks' first-round pick swap rights</p> <p>Let's not speculate on whether Cronin will use Brogdon to acquire more draft picks or if the Bucks will become a team with high-value picks due to the departure of their star player Giannis Antetokounmpo. Let's just focus on the potential development of the Blazers. Cronin did not trade away any young rookies who have only been with the team for two years, nor did he acquire players with high salaries but no added value to the team.</p> <p>In this trade, he acquired 2018 first overall pick Deandre Ayton, who has the potential to become a cornerstone for the team in the next few years, 2021-22 All-Defensive Second Team member and athletic monster Robert Williams III, and the steady and three-point shooting 2020-21 Sixth Man of the Year, Malcolm Brogdon.</p> <p>Cronin stated during media day, \"We want Malcolm to be a part of this team. He brings a lot of value on the court, and off the court, he can be a great leader and big brother to our young players. We need players like him because our roster is young, and I want to have enough veterans to guide these young guys.\"</p> <p>If the Blazers don't make any further changes to their roster, their starting lineup for next season may look like this: Point guard: Malcolm Brogdon, Scoot Henderson Shooting guard: Anfernee Simons, Shaedon Sharpe Small forward: Jerami Grant, Matisse Thybulle Power forward: Robert Williams, Kris Murray, Jabari Walker Center: Deandre Ayton (with Robert Williams III as backup center)</p> <p>This lineup does not resemble a rebuilding team, but instead, it reflects the Blazers' underwhelming results in the past two seasons. Of course, there are still variables to consider. First, Brogdon and Williams must stay healthy throughout the season. Second, rookies Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe must show significant improvement, and lastly, Deandre Ayton must be willing to play defense.</p> <p>If everything goes according to plan, the Blazers may have a chance to compete in the play-in tournament next April.</p> <p>Photo credit: Getty Images</p> <p>This kind of development is not uncommon in the league. Last season's Jazz are a great example. Before the 2022-23 season, the Jazz traded away their two key players, Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert. Losing both their star guard and center seemed like a typical rebuilding move.</p> <p>However, general manager Danny Ainge did not immediately trade away the remaining key players, Mike Conley, Jordan Clarkson, and Jarred Vanderbilt, as everyone expected. Instead, he paired them with the newly acquired Collin Sexton and first-time All-Star selection, Lauri Markkanen.</p> <p>The Jazz had a decent record of 12 wins and 8 losses at the beginning of last season. Throughout the season, they maintained a winning percentage of 50% until the front office decided to trade Conley and Vanderbilt for other players and draft picks. After the trade in February, the Jazz still had a shot at the playoffs for a while, but ultimately, the team decided to focus on obtaining higher draft picks. In their final 11 games, they lost 9 games. The rookies they acquired in the trade, Walker Kessler and Ochai Agbaji, have shown some promise, and with the three draft picks they acquired (Taylor Hendricks, Keynote George, Brice Sensabaugh), as well as the ones they haven't used yet, the Jazz have a strong team for the present and the future.</p> <p>This kind of scenario is not uncommon in the league, as the Lakers also managed to rebuild a championship-contending team after Kobe Bryant's retirement.</p> <p>Therefore, the Blazers' current roster is not as bad as many people may think, and they may have a chance to become the ultimate winners next season.</p>"},{"location":"20231028091151651347/","title":"Introducing TSF - The Skills Factory from Atlanta, USA, a highly regarded basketball preparatory school that focuses on developing the potential of athletes","text":"<p>Introducing TSF - The Skills Factory from Atlanta, USA, a highly regarded basketball preparatory school that focuses on developing the potential of athletes.

However, Tyler Herro, a key player in the team's 2023-24 season, still had to deal with the constant trade talks and uncertainty.</p> <p>Losing out on Lillard wasn't the only setback for the Heat, as defensive stalwart Jrue Holiday quickly joined the Celtics, and the starting backcourt from last season's championship run both left the team. This is not a promising start for the Heat.</p> <p>Please continue reading</p> <p>Introduction: The Heat had a completely different performance in the regular season compared to the playoffs last season. With only 44 wins, they ranked seventh in the East, and losing their first game in the play-in tournament to the Hawks could have meant the end of their season.</p> <p>But the team's momentum completely changed in the first game against the Bulls, and they managed to defeat the No. 1 seed Bucks in five games, thanks to Jimmy Butler's heroic performance and Giannis Antetokounmpo's injury.</p> <p>They went on to defeat the fifth-seeded New York Knicks in six games and pushed the Celtics to the brink of elimination with three consecutive wins in the Eastern Conference Finals, but ultimately lost three straight games and had to win Game 7 on the road to advance to the NBA Finals.</p> <p>In the Finals, they faced a strong and complete Denver Nuggets team, and the size, talent, and skill gap between the two teams were evident. The team's ace, Butler, also seemed to have run out of gas and couldn't match his performance from the previous rounds. Even though center Bam Adebayo put in a great effort to guard Nikola Jokic and had his best playoff performance, it wasn't enough as the Heat lost in five games and missed out on the championship.</p> <p>Looking ahead, as long as the godfather, Pat Riley, is still at the helm, the Heat will always be a competitive team. And with current star player Butler constantly proving his determination and fighting spirit, along with the guidance of the league's best coach, Erik Spoelstra, the team will remain a force to be reckoned with, even if their offseason trades and additions may not be as successful as they hope.</p> <p>Offseason Changes: In: Nikola Jovi\u0107, Jaime Jaquez Jr., Out: Josh Richardson, Gabe Vincent, Max Strus, Thomas Bryant, Cody Zeller, R.J. Hampton, Omer Yurtseven</p> <p>Key Focus for the Season: Continuously finding ways to improve and reach the team's full potential, making moves in the trade market, and relying on Adebayo and Butler as the team's foundation to maintain competitiveness. It is crucial for young players to prove their worth and provide valuable contributions (or become valuable trade assets). Keep an eye on 20-year-old Serbian forward Nikola Jovi\u0107 and first-round pick Jaime Jaquez Jr. (JJJ).</p> <p>Please continue reading</p> <p>At 6'10\", Jovi\u0107 was a starter for the Serbian national team in their journey to the FIBA World Cup finals, playing almost 24 minutes per game. His standout performance was against South Sudan, where he had 25 points, 2 rebounds, 3 assists, and 0 turnovers, shooting 4-4 from two-point range and 5-5 from three-point range, but unfortunately missing one free throw.</p> <p>His performance declined significantly in the more intense rounds of the tournament, only shooting 1-6 against Italy and 4-14 against the Dominican Republic, but he still showed solid passing skills. However, it remains to be seen if he can replicate this performance in the NBA. At the NBA level, Jovi\u0107 may still be a bit too skinny and lacks athleticism. However, he has a good height and ball-handling abilities, along with a smooth shooting stroke, reminding some of former Turkish forward Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu.</p> <p>It's not common for the Heat to choose international players, making Jovi\u0107's selection a rare occurrence. He has a strong competitive spirit and, like many European players, started his professional career early. In 2021, he was selected to the FIBA U19 World Cup Best Five (along with Spurs' No. 1 pick Victor Wembanyama, Thunder's forward Chet Holmgren, and Pistons' guard Jaden Ivey). Jovi\u0107 is still a work in progress, as he has shown good decision-making and intelligence on the court, but needs to accumulate experience with the ball in his hands and improve his defense. He may not have the right environment to develop these skills with the Heat, so he may need to start from the basics and work on his off-ball movement and defense to earn consistent playing time. He has the highest potential among the Heat's young players, and once he fully develops, he can solve Adebayo's lack of range. However, it's highly possible that he may only reach his full potential on another team, similar to how Jokic became a complete player on the Nuggets.</p> <p>Jaime Jaquez, a senior forward from UCLA, is a promising rookie who can provide immediate help. He has average height and athleticism for a forward, but stands out for his combination of footwork and post moves, often using his timing to confuse defenders.</p> <p>His greatest strength in college was his ability to create scoring opportunities with the ball in his hands and not shying away from contact. His defense, shooting, and age caused him to fall in the draft, and he has been unlucky with injuries since joining the Heat. He injured his shoulder in two summer league games and missed most of training camp, only playing in one preseason game. It is expected that Jaquez will be able to contribute right away, but staying healthy should be his top priority.</p> <p>Additionally, the Heat's biggest weakness this season is their three-point shooting, especially with their traditional power forwards and centers being primarily inside players. This is where JJJ's outside shooting abilities become crucial. He has expressed confidence in his shooting during the draft, and the Heat should give him opportunities to prove it. </p>"},{"location":"20231028091238837003/","title":"New Orleans Pelicans forward Trey Murphy underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus on Wednesday during a game, and the results of the evaluation were released today","text":"<p>New Orleans Pelicans forward Trey Murphy underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus on Wednesday during a game, and the results of the evaluation were released today.

Whether it was executing pick and rolls or strong and weak side ball movement, the ball movement was much better than the previous game. Within a few minutes of the game, everyone had taken three-point shots. Horford in the corner, KP at the top of the arc, and Hauser on the fast break. Despite playing with a twin towers lineup, everyone was hitting three-point shots, creating more space than the previous game and utilizing screens more effectively. Keep reading below.</p> <p>However, facing Maxey's defense, despite doing a good job with defense and positioning, he still managed to make tough shots. Combined with several low-level passing errors, the 76ers had many fast break opportunities, but it was White and Holiday's defensive efforts that stopped his speed.</p> <p>However, the bench's defensive resources couldn't keep up with Maxey's speed, and poor defensive communication allowed the 76ers to find their rhythm from the outside. But on the other hand, the 76ers' defensive rotations were also poor, especially in transition defense, allowing Pritchard, Mykhailiuk, and Hauser to gain confidence with their three-point shooting. As long as the ball is rotated calmly, these bench players have the ability to disrupt the opposing team's defense from the outside. Combined with Brissett playing tough in the paint, they can compete with other teams, but it will rely heavily on their three-point shooting and defensive performance. In the middle of the second quarter, the team switched back to the starting lineup, and the pick and roll between the two guards and center was smooth. However, Tucker was very good at reading the center's movement and was able to steal the ball and draw fouls, limiting KP's shooting opportunities.</p> <p>But the two guards also had a great offensive performance. White showed confidence in his three-point shooting and found his rhythm in mid-range jumpers, while Holiday used his speed to break down the defense. On the defensive end, he was precise and tallied three blocks, showcasing the level of defense from both teams. In the second half, Banton was subbed out in less than a minute, seemingly not following the coach's tactics.</p> <p>With a full bench lineup, Pritchard was able to control the pace and even take on Harris on the fast break. But when teammates couldn't finish at the rim, and no one could stop Maxey, it became a struggle on both ends of the court.</p> <p>For a period of time, both teams were settling for three-point shots, lacking ball movement, and preparing for the regular season. After a brief exchange of offense and defense, Hauser made some mistakes by predicting the ball, but Pritchard controlled the pace and boosted the team's confidence with his confident three-point shots. His biggest improvement was his ability to change the pace after pick and rolls. Combined with Queta reducing unnecessary passes from the previous game, as long as there's a chance for a roll in, his energy allows him to finish at the rim.</p> <p>Today, the most impressive player was Svi, not just with his outside shots, but also cutting into the paint and using his explosiveness to score. Gabriel played his role as a hard worker, waiting for his chance under the rim. - - - Ubuntu \ud83e\udd96</p>"},{"location":"20231030091126426422/","title":"Porter\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u4ecd\u7136\u5145\u6eff\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7121\u8ad6\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u706b\u7bad\u751f\u6daf\u5373\u5c07\u7d50\u675f\uff0cNBA\u751f\u6daf\u53ef\u80fd\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4fdd\u3002","text":"<p>Porter\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u4ecd\u7136\u5145\u6eff\u4e0d\u78ba\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7121\u8ad6\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u706b\u7bad\u751f\u6daf\u5373\u5c07\u7d50\u675f\uff0cNBA\u751f\u6daf\u53ef\u80fd\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4fdd\u3002 </p>"},{"location":"20231030091130446953/","title":"Upgrade your coverage and rolling sensation - ASICSGELHOOPV15 Review","text":"<p>Photo/Basketball Notes</p> <p>The timeless classic GELHOOP series from ASICS has now reached V15    Upgrade your coverage and rolling sensation - ASICSGELHOOPV15 Review</p> <p>Photo/Basketball Notes</p> <p>The timeless classic GELHOOP series from ASICS has now reached V15. Among the many ASICS series, basketball enthusiasts who appreciate lightweight shoes with a bit of bounce and cushioning should not miss out on this pair.</p> <p>In terms of appearance, ASICS has always kept changes to a minimum, maintaining the classic look of the series while making slight adjustments to the details. The biggest change in this version is the sleeker design of the heel and collar, with the addition of the \"GELHOOP\" logo. After testing, the editor felt that the cushioning of the GELHOOP V15 was more responsive compared to its counterpart, the GELBURST 27. The FLYTEFOAM midsole provides both cushioning and lightweight features, while the GEL in the heel provides a soft landing. Whether cutting or jumping, one can feel the feedback from the forefoot and heel without sacrificing a close-to-ground feel. The coverage has also been greatly upgraded, with the thickly padded tongue being the first feature the editor noticed when trying them on. The new lace hole design helps the shoe fit perfectly to different foot shapes, achieving a \"one with the shoe\" sensation. Breathability is also a strong point of ASICS shoes, and the V15 uses a PU mesh synthetic upper that provides both coverage and breathability. The midfoot's open window-style extended anti-torsion plate not only increases stability, but also helps the feet breathe 360 degrees.</p> <p>The outsole is a major upgrade in this version, using NC RUBBER rubber. The straight + horizontal tread pattern in the forefoot provides increased traction when making quick stops and changes of direction. The upward curve in the forefoot is a trend in modern basketball shoe design, helping to provide a better rolling sensation when cutting and running, making it suitable for basketball players who cover a long distance on the court. The official positioning of the GELHOOP is a \"lightweight and flexible\" shoe, giving off a sense of stability and streamlined athleticism in both appearance and performance. In addition to being lightweight, it also provides cushioning and coverage for the feet. Basketball players who enjoy this type of shoe should definitely give it a try!</p> <p>Product Name: GELHOOP V15 Price: NT$3,780 Now available: https://www.asics.com.tw/SalePage/Index/8605828</p>"},{"location":"20231030091139984444/","title":"Can the relationship between the NBA and GM Morey be repaired?

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has shown that he can adapt to both American and international rules, and has become a \"big brother\" on both the Thunder and Canadian teams; Dort has proven himself to be a key player for both teams...and also a funny guy (laughs); Giddey has shown great potential, but also has areas where he needs to improve; White is trying to earn a spot on both his professional and national teams, and also has areas where he needs to work harder; and Bertans has changed my opinion of him the most.</p> <p>Here is a recap of the 5 Thunder players at the World Cup, based on my favorite series \"5 takeaways\" from the Thunder Blue fan page. Let's continue reading about Jack White's *first time being selected for the senior national team.</p> <p>Due to Jock Landale's injury, White had the opportunity to make the 12-man roster. Australian team head coach Brian Goorjian believed that White, who had been training with the team, was a player he was familiar with and could contribute in certain formations, so he included him in the rotation. *White did play in all 5 games, but he was not a key rotation player, averaging only 7.6 minutes per game with 2.2 points and 1.6 rebounds. Although he didn't have a lot of playing time, it was still a good start for him.</p> <p>In the first game against Finland, White had his best performance at the World Cup: playing a season-high 15 minutes, shooting 2 for 3 from 2-point range, 1 for 1 from 3-point range, and scoring 7 points with 2 rebounds and 1 assist. In the third game against Japan, which was crucial for advancing to the quarterfinals, he only played for 1 minute; and in the second game against Slovenia, which was crucial for advancing to the knockout stage, he played for only 2 minutes. It's clear that he hasn't gained the trust of the coaching staff yet.</p> <p>Please continue reading *Overall, he has a great attitude, but that's about it. He's not versatile enough as a small forward and undersized as a power forward, so he needs to work harder to find his place on the court.</p> <p>In summary: I don't think White will stay with the Thunder until the start of the season XD Although his NBA future seems uncertain, I still hope he keeps working hard and has the chance to be teammates with Josh Giddey in the future! --Josh Giddey *It was his first time being selected for the senior national team, and he was given a lot of responsibilities in terms of ball handling by Australian team head coach Goorjian starting from the training camp stage.</p> <p>It was even rumored that with Giddey, the Australian team would no longer actively pursue Ben Simmons to join the team.</p> <p>Please continue reading *It's safe to say that \"Giddey was the best player on the Australian team at this World Cup\".</p> <p>In 5 games, he averaged the second-most minutes on the team, only behind veteran Patty Mills, with 19.4 points and 6 assists, along with 5 rebounds and 3.6 turnovers. It's hard to avoid high turnovers for a point guard like Giddey who has great spatial awareness and vision and is not afraid to take risks, but a more concerning issue is that, as mentioned by Bogdanovic on the Play One TV show, he's too eager to make a game-changing assist and often holds onto the ball for too long, which can lead to the team's stagnation... *In addition, his dismal shooting from the outside (3-point shooting percentage of only 16.7%) and numerous missed free throws were pointed out by Luka Doncic.</p> <p>I hope Giddey can reflect on this shortcoming. However, overall, it was still a good showing for his first World Cup and first matchup against Doncic. His aggressive attacks on the basket and a few impressive dunks showed his ambition, and his signature hair-flicking move has almost become his unique trademark! He was also selected as the first recipient of the \"Rising Star\" award at the World Cup! In conclusion: With a lack of strong scorers on the Australian team, they were heavily favored to win a medal at this World Cup, but they fell short in the round of 16. Although it's disappointing, it also exposed some problems with the team's lineup. Giddey had a great performance, but he will face more responsibilities and challenges in the future, so he needs to keep improving his shooting and passing skills! --Luguentz Dort *He participated in the cross-year training program with the Canadian senior national team and has been playing with the team since the World Cup qualification games. Although the FIBA world rankings only place Canada at 15th, the team composed of Dort and many other active NBA players was considered to have the best chance of winning a medal.</p> <p>Dort and Dillon Brooks were positioned as 3-and-D, wing defensive locks on the team, but compared to Brooks' brilliant performance of \"redeeming himself\", Dort, who has been inconsistent on offense, is still the familiar Dort XD In 6 games, Dort had a field goal percentage of &gt;40% in 3 games and &lt;25% in the other 3 games... He averaged 24.7 minutes per game with 8.2 points and 4.3 rebounds, and a field goal percentage of 41.2%/34.5%/55.6%. That's really the Dort we know XD *It's worth mentioning that Dort's best performance (game 2 of the group stage against Brazil) coincided with the worst performance of the Canadian team as a whole. In that game, Dort scored 17 points on 6 for 11 shooting, but the rest of his teammates, except for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, couldn't buy a basket.</p> <p>*In contrast, in the first game of the group stage against Brazil, Dort didn't have a good showing (0 points on 5 attempts, the only points coming from 4 made free throws), but the Canadian team shot a 3-point percentage of 51.9%, and they lost to Brazil 77-94. It can be said that it was their worst game at this World Cup.</p> <p>Please continue reading *Although I love Dort's style of play the most, he played in every game at the World Cup, but he didn't really contribute to the Canadian team, so I was a bit disappointed.</p> <p>In conclusion: Although Nick Nurse, the head coach of the Canadian team, mentioned in a recent interview that they have an obligation to include Dort on the team, they also want to give him a chance to show his skills and compete for future opportunities. I still believe that Dort will continue to shine with the Thunder and bring more surprises to the Canadian team! --Davis Bertans *I have to say, it was a pleasant surprise that Bertans was selected for the Latvian team.</p> <p>*Originally, he was hoping to use his big brother Kristaps Porzingis and their popularity in the same city to attract fans to come watch the games.</p> <p>Please continue reading *But Porzingis withdrew from the Latvian team voluntarily due to Edgars Ieguskis' injury, so the big brother and little brother (Ieguskis returned to the team at this World Cup and averaged a high 30.8 minutes per game with 18.8 points and 6.3 rebounds) did not have the opportunity to play together for the Latvian team.</p> <p>*But Bertans decided to stay and give his all for the Latvian team, hoping to let more fans see his performance.</p> <p>*As a result, he succeeded, and the Latvian team advanced to the quarterfinals for the first time in the World Cup. Bertans also became a key scorer for the team.</p> <p>Please continue reading *In 5 games, he averaged 20.6 minutes per game with 9.6 points and 2.8 rebounds, and a field goal percentage of 41.5%/28.6%/88.9%.</p> <p>*His best performance was against the Spanish team, playing 29 minutes and scoring 23 points with 5 rebounds and a field goal percentage of 6 for 5, along with 1 assist. Unfortunately, they still lost to the Spanish team 67-85.</p> <p>In conclusion: Bertans' performance wasn't too impressive, but he was consistent, and it gave me a glimpse of his future development with the Thunder. I hope he continues to play well and brings more firepower to the Thunder next season! Lastly, I just want to say: although the group stage of the World Cup is over, the performances of these 5 Thunder players have already shown their potential and room for growth. I look forward to seeing them continue to work hard and bring more surprises to the Thunder!</p>"},{"location":"20231030091215715944/","title":"T1 League Taichung Sun Expresses Strong Protest Against T1 League's Unreasonable Decision and Will Seek Legal Recourse","text":"<p>The Taichung Sun released a statement protesting against the decision made by the T1 League   T1 League Taichung Sun Expresses Strong Protest Against T1 League's Unreasonable Decision and Will Seek Legal Recourse</p> <p>The Taichung Sun released a statement protesting against the decision made by the T1 League.

Going from a record of 6 wins and 24 losses in their first season to making it to the finals, although they were swept by the champions, it was still a very successful season for the Eagles. But after a summer break, can this three-tower lineup lead the team back to the finals or even win the championship? Last season, the three towers combined for an average of 61.4 points and 36.1 rebounds per game. Among them, Ares (Robert Upshaw III) was the most important. After joining the Eagles last season, he averaged 21.8 points, 12 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game in 25 games. What's more important is that he attempted 5.6 three-pointers per game and had a 35% shooting percentage. Although this shooting percentage is not high, it is rare for a 213cm tall center to provide important firepower from both the inside and outside, making him the most indispensable tower in the three-tower lineup.</p> <p>However, from the two official warm-up games and the league's opening game, the Eagles' proud \"Lalashan\" connection no longer seems familiar to everyone. Please continue reading Picture source/ Tainan Taiwan Steel Eagles official fan page. \"Lalashan\" connection has cracks? Ares scored 0 points and 8 rebounds in the opening game. However, after a summer break, Ares not only suffered an injury in an NBL game and announced on IG that he would end his remaining NBL season because his teammate Deguara played too dirty, but also did not play in the official warm-up game organized by the league. The coach Liu Mengzhu explained that he simply hoped that Ares could prepare for the opening game in good health. However, Ares performed poorly in the opening game. Apart from the obvious physical changes, he only played for 12 minutes and missed both of his shots, with a terrible stat line of 0 points and 8 rebounds. If Ares cannot quickly regain his physical and game feel, it will undoubtedly cause significant damage to the entire team.</p> <p>Picture source/ T1 League Apart from Ares, there are also concerns about Bhullar's condition. Although he had a performance of 14 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 blocks in the warm-up game and a shooting percentage of 66.7%, he still showed signs of physical changes. Among the three players, only Deguara seems to have maintained or even improved his performance. He scored 45 points against the War Gods in the warm-up game and nearly achieved a double-double of 22 points and 19 rebounds in the opening game against the Special Attack. He posed a threat to the War Gods in the first two quarters. However, as the game went on, it could be seen that Deguara's stamina was not enough to dominate the game. Moreover, it is obvious that the team or Deguara himself hopes to at least improve their speed. Therefore, he had to use more energy to run in this game compared to last season, and the Eagles lost to the Special Attack once again. Eagles' problems remain: No outside shooting, no playmaking Just from this opening game, it can be seen that the Eagles have not solved the problems they had last season. Although they have acquired several players, including Sun's descendants such as Su Yijin, and a foreign player with good scoring ability, Kim-Eun, the team still lacks a stable outside shooter and a playmaking guard. The team's three-point shooting percentage was only 34.4%, with 15 assists and 24 turnovers, indicating that the Eagles will only have a worse record than last season if they continue to play like this. Moreover, this three-point shooting percentage was only achieved because Kim-Eun made 5 of his 8 attempts. However, Kim-Eun's three-point shooting percentage was less than 30% last season, so it is almost impossible for him to maintain this percentage in future games.</p> <p>Picture source/ T1 League It will be very difficult to change the playing style with just Kim-Eun Coach Liu Mengzhu once said in an interview that after Kim-Eun joined the team, we might see less of the \"Lalashan\" lineup, because he hopes to improve the team's speed in both offense and defense this season. This is a good idea and direction, and also the only place where we can see the Eagles trying to solve their weaknesses from last season. In the opening game, it can also be seen that the Eagles do want to push the ball quickly after securing rebounds, but it resulted in consecutive turnovers. In the second half, it can also be seen that the players still wanted to pass the ball into the paint, but as Deguara's stamina decreased, this strategy only resulted in more turnovers. The congested paint also made it impossible for the frontcourt players to make backdoor cuts. The lack of a plan for outside shooting and finishing point also caused turnovers even when the team tried to make passes at the top of the arc.

However, the real challenge lies in how they can integrate Lillard into head coach Adrian Griffin's system. According to the latest sports betting odds, the Bucks are the clear favorites to win the championship in the 2023-24 season. Lillard's arrival has definitely raised the stakes for the Bucks, as they now have two star players who can both score over 20 points per game, making them one of the most powerful duos in the NBA.</p> <p>Please continue readingHowever, having a strong roster on paper does not guarantee success on the court. It will take some time for Griffin to figure out how to best utilize Lillard and create chemistry within the team.</p> <p>Offensively, the integration process should not be too difficult. Lillard's outside shooting and Antetokounmpo's inside presence will complement each other well. After playing together in their first preseason game, both players expressed how comfortable they felt playing with each other.</p> <p>\"When the opponent double teams me or sets traps, I have Giannis to pass to. It's just too easy,\" Lillard said after their first game against the Lakers. \"It was the first time I felt so free on the court,\" Antetokounmpo added, as Lillard's elite shooting and scoring ability created more space for him to operate.</p> <p>With a top-notch inside-outside combo, the Bucks will have a unique and powerful offensive attack. Compared to Jrue Holiday, Lillard brings a stronger individual offense and outside shooting, not only freeing up space for Antetokounmpo, but also creating more opportunities for Khris Middleton on the perimeter.</p> <p>Last season, the Bucks ranked 7th in the league for the number of pick-and-rolls executed per game (16.7). They also did not have much off-ball movement or isolation plays. Lillard's ball-handling skills will be a perfect addition to the Bucks, who lacked this type of player. He can create opportunities in pick-and-roll situations and also create his own outside shot. This will allow Antetokounmpo and Middleton to focus on their strengths as finishers.</p> <p>Please continue readingAgainst teams facing the Bucks, they will not be able to double team Middleton when Antetokounmpo is on the perimeter. With his athleticism and height, Antetokounmpo will have more opportunities to cut to the basket when Lillard, a skilled playmaker and outside shooter, is on the court. Not to mention, his passing ability will also be a threat. Photo credit: Getty ImagesNext, let's talk about defense. In the past 5 seasons, the Bucks have ranked in the top 10 in defensive efficiency for 4 of those seasons.</p> <p>In the 2022-23 season, when Holiday was the primary defender against opponents, the team's defensive efficiency ranked 4th in the league.</p> <p>Although Lillard's defense is not on the same level as Holiday's, the Bucks are not too concerned, as they have two former Defensive Player of the Year candidates in Antetokounmpo and center Brook Lopez.</p> <p>Another important change is that the Bucks have lost their veteran depth in recent seasons. While players like Jae Crowder, Pat Connaughton, and Bobby Portis are still on the team, Wes Matthews and Joe Ingles have left, and Grayson Allen was traded in the Lillard deal. New additions to the team include Malik Beasley and backup point guard Cameron Payne.</p> <p>Beasley is expected to be a key reserve for the Bucks, as he has a career 3-point percentage of 37.8% and has averaged over 20 points per game in a single season. With above-average defense, the Bucks will need him to provide scoring off the bench. Please continue readingDespite some concerns, this roster revamp is highly anticipated. In 2020, the Bucks underwent major changes in order to win a championship. They traded away starting point guard Eric Bledsoe, who struggled with his shooting in the playoffs, for Holiday, a top-notch defender. Head coach Mike Budenholzer also adjusted the team's offensive strategy, focusing more on attacking the paint and being more aggressive in rebounding. At first, this new approach did not work well and the team even faced a 5-game losing streak, their worst in 4 years, with only 16 wins and 13 losses in 29 games.</p> <p>\"We all understand that things won't always go as planned,\" Middleton reflected on that season. \"We knew we needed to use different strategies to win. That's what a successful team does: they are able to adapt their roster and strategies. Because in this highly competitive league, you can't stay the same.\"</p> <p>In the end, the Bucks won their first championship in franchise history, ending a 50-year drought. In the 2023-24 season, the Bucks will face many challenges once again, but with Lillard on board, there will be more strategies and sparks. It will be up to new head coach Griffin to serve up the right dishes. While Griffin has expressed his desire for the team to play faster, he has not revealed much about his strategy, so it is unclear how much it will differ from Budenholzer's approach.</p> <p>One thing is for sure: how the duo of Lillard and Antetokounmpo will work together will be the key to the Bucks' long journey in the playoffs. Both players are superstars in their own right, but whether they can be a deadly duo will determine if they can lead the Bucks to another championship.</p>"},{"location":"20231031091154435183/","title":"\u5f9e\u88ab\u9078\u4e2d\u5230\u843d\u9078\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u5982\u4eca\u7684\u4e00\u6642\u4e4b\u9078\uff0cLuguentz Dort\u7528\u81ea\u5df1\u5805\u6bc5\u7684\u610f\u5fd7\u8207\u4e0d\u65b7\u9032\u6b65\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u50f9\u503c\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u64c5\u9577\u9632\u5b88\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u5145\u6eff\u6f5b\u529b\u7684\u5e74\u8f15\u7403\u661f\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u5145\u6eff\u8457\u7121\u9650\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u62ed\u76ee\u4ee5\u5f85\u3002","text":"<p>\u5f9e\u88ab\u9078\u4e2d\u5230\u843d\u9078\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u5982\u4eca\u7684\u4e00\u6642\u4e4b\u9078\uff0cLuguentz Dort\u7528\u81ea\u5df1\u5805\u6bc5\u7684\u610f\u5fd7\u8207\u4e0d\u65b7\u9032\u6b65\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u8b49\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u50f9\u503c\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u64c5\u9577\u9632\u5b88\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u5145\u6eff\u6f5b\u529b\u7684\u5e74\u8f15\u7403\u661f\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u672a\u4f86\u5145\u6eff\u8457\u7121\u9650\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u62ed\u76ee\u4ee5\u5f85\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231031091156515589/","title":"NBA player Rui Hachimura has made an appearance in the popular Japanese animation \"Crayon Shin-chan\" and will join the show's main characters, Shin-chan and Shiro, in their fight against a meteor attack","text":"<p>NBA player Rui Hachimura has made an appearance in the popular Japanese animation \"Crayon Shin-chan\" and will join the show's main characters, Shin-chan and Shiro, in their fight against a meteor attack.

the best moment in two years</p> <p>Ben Simmons. Photo/Reuters The Nets played against the Lakers in a preseason game in Las Vegas today. Ben Simmons, who has been plagued by back injuries in the past few years, also played and scored 10 points in 14 minutes with 3 assists. After the game, he also gave an interview about his current condition.</p> <p>\"It feels great, really great. I'm glad to be able to play and compete against the opposing team. I feel really good right now, this is definitely the best I've felt in my body in the past two years, for sure,\" Simmons said. Nets head coach Jacque Vaughn also commented on Simmons' performance: \"He attacked the basket all night. I think he controlled the game pace very naturally on the court and communicated well with his teammates about the game. I'm very happy to see these things he showed.\" In addition to the post-game interview, Simmons also said, \"I'm excited, very excited. Being able to come here and play and put on a high-intensity game, I'm very grateful for that.

<p>The Future of NBA Team Building: A New Version of the CBA Inspires Change</p> <p>If you were to ask what we learned from the NBA this season, it's likely that the teams are changing the way they build their rosters.</p> <p>This year, the league and the players' association approved a new collective bargaining agreement that clearly disadvantages the highest-spending teams, but also quietly puts more pressure on the lowest-spending teams.</p> <p>For a long time, younger teams that rely on lottery picks have often tried to save money for a longer period of time. Part of the reason is that for lower-expectation teams, this is an easier way to barely get by. Please continue reading before the new CBA, there was no incentive for teams to spend money before they were ready to win. This created an environment where some teams started the season with a total salary far below the salary cap, hoping to use this space to make trades with desperate teams for draft picks. However, this will no longer be the case, as the Pistons are currently projected to have the most salary space at the start of the 2023-24 season - $31.5 million. This is a huge difference compared to the millions of dollars in salary space that teams had in previous seasons. The reason is that under the new CBA, saving money is not really an option.</p> <p>Just look at the Rockets. They went from being one of the youngest teams in the league last season, tied with the Spurs for second-to-last place, to now being one of the top spending teams in free agency. The Rockets' accelerated timeline has a reason behind it. Of course, their young players can benefit from playing alongside true professionals and receiving guidance. Especially since the Rockets lacked a stable point guard before this season, their situation has now started to generate real developmental costs. However, under the new CBA, especially for teams like the Rockets who had nearly $60 million in salary space at the start of the summer, there is nothing they can do besides spend money.</p> <p>Please continue reading in general, it takes NBA management a few seasons to fully adapt to the market environment brought about by the new CBA, but the Rockets are the first team to break through this barrier. They quickly solved all the problems and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on players like Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Jock Landale, and Jeff Green. Photo credit: Getty Images While other teams in the league are watching, especially those on the edge of rebuilding, the Rockets have also struck a good balance between spending and safety measures. These trades all come with conditions, including team options for VanVleet and Green, salary decreases for Brooks within the contract term, and a four-year contract for Landale (the last three years of which are not guaranteed).</p> <p>These are all measures taken by management because they can no longer sit on a salary cap space like they did in the past. Under the previous CBA, teams were mildly encouraged to spend 90% of the cap space before the last day of the regular season (known as the salary floor), and there would be no significant impact if they didn't. The new CBA moved this deadline up to the first day of the season, and it has a real impact - any unused salary cap space will be cut to the salary floor, and teams that fail to reach the floor will be fined with the luxury tax and prevented from making any trades that would reduce their total salary for the season.</p> <p>Please continue reading these tightening measures have become meaningless. Not only does each team have to increase its spending to reach the salary floor, but teams that fail to reach the floor will also lose more money and rebuilding opportunities in the process.</p> <p>So far, the result has been that secondary teams in the league play a more active role in the free agent market or through offseason trades for veterans, just like the Pistons trading for Cam Payne and Cedi Osman. Last year, the Spurs greeted the new season with a salary total that was far below the salary floor and nearly $30 million below the salary cap, but now they are projected to exceed this salary total in the 2023-24 season (as well as the generation of Victor Wembanyama), and almost every other team is in the same situation.</p> <p>Stockpiling salary cap space is no longer useful. If any team chooses to only reach the salary floor, they will only have $13.6 million in space to absorb salaries throughout the season, which is not even enough to afford players like D'Angelo Russell or Marcus Morris. Lower-spending teams will not have enough space to operate (or in other words, there is currently almost no salary space available for rent), making it much more difficult for championship-contending teams to reduce salaries when needed. If there are not a few lottery teams each year waiting to assist, then all the affairs of the league will become more complicated, and these potential helpers will behave more like the Rockets, Spurs, or Pistons, meaning that they are closer to being a true NBA team, and this will lead to a chemistry experiment.</p> <p>Compared to last season, the Rockets undoubtedly have a better and more complete roster, and they have just acquired some veterans, including an All-Star starting point guard and a confident wing player, who they expect to play important roles in a young team still in the process of growth.</p> <p>With the removal of salary restrictions, the Rockets will have more opportunities to sign key free agents or compete for players that teams do not want to pay high salaries for in the trade market. This is a huge shift for the Rockets, who were always limited by salary space in the past, and now they can start building a true NBA team. This is also an important shift for the league, as it means that there will be more teams joining in this transformation in the future.</p>"},{"location":"20231101091127966976/","title":"\u6700\u5f8c\u6211\u5011\u4f86\u770b\u8f2a\u66ff\u9019\u4ef6\u4e8b\uff0c\u8f2a\u66ff\u9019\u4ef6\u4e8b\uff0c\u6700\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u5c31\u662f\uff0cGiannis\u548cLillard\uff0c\u9019\u5169\u4f4d\u8d85\u7d1a\u5de8\u661f\uff0c\u6253\u7403\u7684\u6642\u9593\u6703\u66f4\u9577\uff0c\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u597d\u8655\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u806f\u76df\u524d\u5341\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u6253\u7403\u7684\u6642\u9593\u6700\u591a\uff0c\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u58de\u8655\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u8b8a\u6210\u516c\u9e7f\u7684\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u4f46\u7e3d\u7684\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u4ef6\u597d\u4e8b\u3002","text":"<p>\u9019\u7a2e\u4e8b\u60c5\u6211\u5011\u5728\u8a55\u8ad6\u516c\u9e7f\u65b0\u7248\u7684\u6642\u5019\uff0c\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u73fe\u5728\u516c\u9e7f\u5df2\u7d93\u4e0d\u662f\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u7403\u968a\u4e86\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u662f\u8981\u596a\u51a0\u7684\uff0c\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u58d3\u529b\uff0c\u610f\u5473\u8457\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u90fd\u662f\u52dd\u8ca0\u95dc\u9375\uff0c\u90a3\u9ebc\u5728\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u516c\u9e7f\u7684\u4e09\u5de8\u982d\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5920\u6490\u8d77\u6574\u500b\u7403\u968a\uff1f\u5982\u679c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4f4d\u53d7\u50b7\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u9084\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u7403\u54e1\u53ef\u4ee5\u633a\u8eab\u800c\u51fa\uff1f\u9019\u4e9b\u90fd\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u601d\u8003\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002</p>

Lion City Lions, achieved their first victory in the FIBA Intercontinental Cup in Singapore. The team, consisting of coaches, players, and foreign players, arrived in Singapore yesterday (22) to participate in the 2023 FIBA Intercontinental Cup exhibition game. In addition to showcasing their players, the Lion City Lions also brought their home court host, DJ, Muse Girls, and interactive activities to Singapore, hoping to share their experience in professional basketball management with the Singapore Sports Council and deepen cooperation and exchanges with Singapore and East Asian basketball in the future.</p> <p>The Lion City Lions were recognized by the local quality construction brand \"Da Yan Construction\" in Hsinchu, and the two sides officially joined hands to become the team's title sponsor for this exhibition game, known as the \"Hsinchu Da Yan Lion City Lions\". This morning, the Muse Girls and mascot Rudy led a group of fans to tour the historic buildings in Singapore, including the Asian Civilization Museum, Victoria Theatre, Old Singapore Parliament Building, and the Merlion Park. They also designed interactive games during the trip to help fans get to know the Muse Girls and mascot Rudy better, and create unforgettable memories with the Lion City Lions during this trip.</p> <p>Muse Girls captain Linlin happily stated: \"This is my first time traveling with fans as a cheerleader, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make fans support the Lion City Lions even more. I also hope that after this international exchange event, Muse Girls can increase their popularity in Asia!\" The Lion City Lions started the game against the Singapore Slingers at noon at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. In order to allow local and foreign players to bond through the game, the Lion City Lions sent high Guo Hao, Wang Zigang, Shi Yanzong, Berlin, and Euro Lion Fu as the starting lineup.</p> <p>From the beginning, the Lion City Lions showed their determination to win, and with a double-digit lead, the bench players also contributed to the team's victory, including Zhang Jiewei, Liu Guangshang, and Jiang Guangqian, who scored 12, 11, and 10 points respectively. The Lion City Lions defeated the Singapore Slingers 84:61.</p> <p>It was Euro Lion Fu's first time representing the Lion City Lions in a public game, and he scored 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 3 blocks with an 83% shooting percentage in just 15 minutes of play. He was also voted as the best player of the game by the fans at the scene. Euro Lion Fu said: \"I am very happy that I was able to help the team win in my first game. Even though we were playing in a different city today, having fans from Hsinchu coming to watch the game made me feel like I was playing at home. I also believe that with this kind of team atmosphere, I can quickly integrate into the team.\"</p> <p>When asked about the team's chemistry, head coach Lin Guanlun stated: \"Today's main goal was team integration, while also giving our young players more opportunities to improve. Due to the limited time our foreign players had for team practice, I hope they can become more familiar with the team through games. Today was a test for our new lineup.\" The Hsinchu Da Yan Lion City Lions and the Singapore Slingers participated in the 2023 FIBA Intercontinental Cup exhibition game in Singapore.</p>"},{"location":"20231101091141629130/","title":"In their first game of the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, the Chinese team faced Hong Kong, a team with a significant difference in size and strength","text":"<p>In their first game of the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, the Chinese team faced Hong Kong, a team with a significant difference in size and strength. The Chinese team quickly established a double-digit lead in the first quarter and maintained a steady lead throughout the game, ultimately winning by 19 points.</p> <p>While the Chinese team's victory was not insignificant, it was not a particularly impressive win either. All five players scored in double digits and the team had a nearly 20-point margin of victory, but upon closer examination, there are still many areas that need improvement. Please continue reading on Instagram to see this post from Basketball Notes (@basketball_biji) for more.</p> <p>One of the issues in this game was the limited vision of center William Joseph Artino, who was unable to fully utilize his height advantage. The Chinese team had a significant height advantage at every position, especially in the paint, where Hong Kong only had two players over 6'7\" compared to China's four, with their starting center Duncan Overbeck Reid standing at only 6'9\" compared to Artino's 6'11\". However, Hong Kong primarily used a \"small-ball\" lineup, which allowed the Chinese team to dominate the paint. While the Chinese team did have a slight advantage in second-chance points, they did not fully exploit their height advantage.</p> <p>Hong Kong's defense was also highly active, quickly collapsing on Chinese players in the low post or on screens, making it difficult for the Chinese team to score in the paint.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Artino's limited passing vision prevented the Chinese team from taking full advantage of Hong Kong's defensive collapse. The team's big men also did not perform as well as expected, as Hong Kong's perimeter defenders were not particularly skilled at one-on-one defense. Instead, the Chinese team relied on their three main scorers, Lin Tingqian, Abasi, and Liu Zheng, who used their individual abilities to continue scoring steadily.</p> <p>Please continue reading below for more on the team's slow adjustments on defense. Compared to their offense, the Chinese team has more room for improvement on defense.</p> <p>In this game, the Chinese team used a man-to-man defense for most of the game, with a clear goal from the coaching staff to force turnovers and score in transition.</p> <p>While this defensive strategy did create turnovers, Hong Kong also had a high turnover rate, with 23 compared to China's 13. However, Hong Kong's quick transition defense limited China's fast break opportunities, and they only had a slight advantage in transition points. Please continue reading below for more on the team's failure to capitalize on turnovers.</p> <p>Since the man-to-man defense did not produce the intended results and came at a cost, there was no need to stick with it. The coaching staff should have made adjustments on the spot, such as shrinking the defensive coverage or switching to a zone defense. Additionally, since Hong Kong struggled with their outside shooting, only hitting 20% of their three-pointers, the Chinese team could have considered a \"no layup, no foul\" defense.</p> <p>The team's slow adjustments on defense have been an issue before, as seen in their previous games against Iran and the United States in the Jones Cup, where they were slow to react and failed to make timely adjustments. This is an area that the coaching staff needs to pay more attention to. While it's not surprising that the Chinese team easily defeated a weaker opponent like Hong Kong, it's clear that they have not yet reached their full potential. For example, their outside shooting was not as effective as usual, with a 22.9% three-point shooting percentage compared to 34.6% in the Jones Cup.</p> <p>For the Chinese team, it is important to make the most of the remaining group stage games and continue to improve as they aim for the quarter-finals. \u203bFor more basketball articles, follow my Instagram page @etbasketball.

Chet Holmgren played 19.3 minutes per game, averaging 16.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 2.0 blocks with shooting percentages of 57.8/50.0/75.0. Jalen Williams played 22.8 minutes per game, averaging 16.8 points, 3.0 assists, and 1.8 steals with shooting percentages of 48.0/35.7/69.6. Josh Giddey played 22.3 minutes per game, averaging 12.0 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.3 assists with shooting percentages of 51.2/0/54.5. The most anticipated player in the starting lineup was Chet Holmgren, who returned from a season-long injury and made his debut in the NBA level game. He had a strong performance in the first game against this year's number one pick, Victor Wenbanyama, and continued to show his skills throughout the preseason. He has a variety of offensive tools, not only with a great finishing touch but also with a mid-range shot from the left and right of the free throw line. He can also anticipate rebounds and put them back in, and without the ball, he can use his positioning and catch-and-shoot abilities to help the team and regain his three-point shooting accuracy.</p> <p>His offensive threat also earned him an average of 5.0 free throw attempts per game, second only to Jalen Williams' 5.8 attempts. However, he needs to work on reducing his turnovers. On the defensive end, he performed as expected, making it difficult for opponents to score at the rim. In the game against the Pistons, he had 3 blocks in just 13 minutes, blocking players like Jalen Duren, James Wiseman, and Jaden Ivey.</p> <p>Although Holmgren's performance was impressive, the best player in terms of multiple statistics in this preseason was Jalen Williams. After gaining weight, he played as the power forward and not only had to defend players like Wenbanyama and Giannis Antetokounmpo, but also played a key role in the offense. Despite handling so many responsibilities, he maintained his efficiency and deserves praise.</p> <p>Although Josh Giddey worked with shooting coach Chip Engelland to improve his three-point shooting before the preseason, he still struggled with his outside shooting (and free throws). He needs to work on his ball handling skills, and his best performance was against the Bucks when Brook Lopez was not playing. Hopefully, he can adjust by the start of the season.</p> <p>Luguentz Dort had a very efficient performance in the preseason, shooting over 50% from the field and over 40% from three-point range. He also made smarter shot selections compared to last season. His quality over quantity performance is exactly what the Thunder need in the future. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the main player who had a great performance in the World Cup, only played in two games and was the least visible starter on the team (laughs). Bench players Isaiah Joe and Kenrich Williams were both consistent and used their movement to create scoring opportunities for themselves and the team. Olivier Sarr played as a twin tower with Holmgren for a while, but his skills are not at the rotation level yet.</p> <p>New additions Vasilije Micic played 18.5 minutes per game, averaging 5.5 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 6.0 assists with shooting percentages of 30.8/15.4/50.0. Cason Wallace played 19.7 minutes per game, averaging 7.3 points, 2.0 assists, and 1.5 steals with shooting percentages of 50.0/42.9/66.7. Davis Bertans played 10.5 minutes per game, averaging 9.0 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 0.8 steals with a three-point shooting percentage of 52.9%.</p> <p>In his first game playing the American style of basketball, Vasilije Micic had to adapt to many things, but his playmaking skills were brought over from Serbia. He averaged 6.0 assists per game, surpassing Giddey as the team's assist leader, and also the assist leader among all rookies in this preseason. He is very patient with the ball and uses his defensive gravity to wait until the last moment before passing to an open teammate. With the Thunder's bench lineup consisting of many players with off-ball abilities, Micic racked up 24 assists in just 75 minutes of playing time, meaning he gets an assist in less than 4 minutes!</p> <p>Cason Wallace, who is expected to be the third young core player for the Thunder, showed some similarities in playing style with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in his impressive high school stats. However, in the preseason, he tended to take too many shots, and the team hopes he can take more shots, but his offensive skills and rhythm will be his focus for development in the future.</p> <p>In his first preseason game since leaving the Wizards, Davis Bertans had a very active performance, but as the game went on, his shooting opportunities decreased. He only had 7 attempts, with 4 of them being three-pointers, and all 4 were in the first game against the Bulls. He also had one attempt from beyond the free throw line, but in the last game against the Bucks, he didn't even get a chance to shoot a three-pointer, with his teammates taking all the opportunities.</p> <p>The future of the Thunder's main players will continue to mature as the team continues to mesh, and it will also be the focus of fans' expectations. However, in this preseason, the performance of the rookies was also impressive, and we look forward to seeing them continue to improve and bring more surprises for the team in the upcoming games.</p>"},{"location":"20231101091209814302/","title":"NBAPreseason| Live on ESPN2pic","text":"<p>NBAPreseason| Live on ESPN2pic.twitter.com/dDnBFi9j6b\u2014 NBA (@NBA)October 14, 2023In the preseason, when Steve Kerr was interviewed, he said, \"We are not the most athletic team.

However, with the stars getting older and physical disadvantages, the Warriors need more easy points from the free throw line, in addition to scoring through constant running and physical confrontation. Please continue reading. The Warriors still rely mainly on three-pointers and backdoor scoring, but adding 8 to 10 passes and 2 to 3 dunks per game would definitely make a huge difference.</p> <p>And Kuminga has the ability to take the Warriors to a new level. It can be said that Kuminga is the most important player for the Warriors this season, as most of the Warriors' players are small in size and age, and most of their scoring still relies on shooting. Kuminga is one of the few young players on the team with a tall and strong physique. Photo source: Getty ImagesIn addition to offense, Kuminga will also have an impact on the team's defense. In the past, he occasionally made serious mistakes on defense or was in the wrong position, but now there is no one else on the team with the same physical qualities as him.</p> <p>His athleticism and physique will bring great help to the team, something that no one else on the Warriors can do. Please continue reading. If Kuminga can threaten opponents on the perimeter, he will be the main power forward for the Warriors this season.</p> <p>The Warriors will let Draymond Green guard the paint and create a crazy defensive line in the paint.</p> <p>CP3 and Dario Saric, who were added in the offseason, will provide help for the Warriors, but the key player for the Warriors this season is Kuminga.</p> <p>Everyone already knows the skills and impact of Curry, Thompson, Green, Wiggins, and CP3, so the real variable is Kuminga, making him the X-factor for the Warriors this season.</p> <p>If he evolves, the Warriors will once again be feared by their opponents, as they will have too many ways to score and will no longer rely solely on three-pointers.</p> <p>Kuminga will not only have a crucial impact on the Warriors this season, but also in the years to come. After Thompson, there is a high chance that he will sign a new contract with the Warriors, and Green still has four years left on his contract. Although the main players are still here, their age is getting older and their overall athleticism has been declining. With the energy and power brought by Kuminga, the team with an average age that is on the older side still has a chance to turn things around and have hope for contending for the championship in the next few years.

The Nuggets and Heat, who made it to the final stage, were not favored to advance this far before the playoffs began.</p> <p>The Heat started from the play-in round and after losing their first game to the Hawks, they fought their way back and became the second eighth-seeded team in history to make it to the NBA Finals. The Nuggets also overcame multiple obstacles, defeating the Timberwolves with their twin towers, eliminating the Suns with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker, and sweeping the Lakers led by LeBron James and Anthony Davis. They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history and lifted the championship trophy.</p> <p>Please continue reading below to learn about the 46-year-long perseverance that led to the Nuggets' first championship in franchise history. In NBA history, no other team has endured a longer wait than the Nuggets.</p> <p>The key player in the championship victory, Nikola Joki\u0107, is a non-traditional MVP. He was drafted in the second round in 2014, as the 41st pick by the Nuggets. Interestingly, when he was selected, the draft broadcast was interrupted by a Taco Bell commercial.</p> <p>Today, Joki\u0107 has become the first player in NBA history to be selected outside of the lottery and win both the regular season MVP and Finals MVP awards.</p> <p>The above, whether it is the matchup or the Finals MVP, highlights the extraordinary nature of this year's NBA Finals. The unique experiences of the Nuggets and Heat also bring many insights to the league's ecosystem. This series will analyze the revolutionary impact that the Nuggets and Heat series has brought to the basketball world in three articles.</p> <p>Revolutionary Impact of the 2023 NBA Finals Vol.1: The Nuggets' Championship Symbolizes the Decline of Small-Ball Era, Will the Return of Big Men Follow?</p> <p>Revolutionary Impact of the 2023 NBA Finals Vol.2: Is the Three-Pointer No Longer a Guarantee for Victory? The Nuggets' Victory Will Spark the League's Renaissance.</p> <p>Image source</p> <p>Please continue reading below.</p> <p>In the previous article, we discussed how the Nuggets won the championship with their steady interior attack, which stands out in today's basketball world dominated by three-point shooting. Their success may spark a new wave of renaissance. This article will focus on the tactical core of the Nuggets - Joki\u0107. The term \"chandelier complex\" is a perfect description for the competition between Nikola Joki\u0107 and Joel Embiid, who have been ranked first and second in the MVP voting for three consecutive seasons. However, while Joki\u0107 belongs to the Nuggets, who ended a 46-year-long championship drought this year, Embiid's 76ers have been eliminated in the second round of the playoffs for the third consecutive year.</p> <p>Although he has been unable to win the MVP award, Joki\u0107 has once again outperformed Embiid in a different way.</p> <p>In terms of team lineup, the Nuggets have a much more complete and well-rounded roster, and their offensive and defensive systems are also slightly better than the 76ers.</p> <p>Please continue reading below.</p> <p>In this year's playoffs, the 76ers' offense mainly relies on three strategies: Embiid's low-post isolation, the high pick-and-roll between James Harden and Embiid, and forcing the opponent to switch defensively with screens and then taking advantage of the mismatch with either Harden or Embiid. In general, the 76ers' offense is based on individual play. On the other hand, the Nuggets have a wide range of tactical variations. Joki\u0107 can handle the ball in the low post and can also act as a facilitator from the high post. He can also work together with guards in a two-man game. Additionally, the Nuggets' players have excellent awareness of moving without the ball and setting screens, constantly keeping the ball and players in motion, making it difficult for opponents to defend.</p> <p>Even when Joki\u0107 and Jamal Murray execute the pick-and-roll, the shooters positioned in the corner are not just standing still, waiting for the ball. They are constantly seeking opportunities to cut to the basket. Furthermore, in the face of the Heat's trademark zone defense, a comparison between the Celtics and Nuggets shows the Nuggets' deep tactical knowledge.</p> <p>The Celtics, who were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals, mainly used high pick-and-roll to create mismatches and then attack the defender who had to switch. However, when the Heat changed their zone defense from \"2-3\" to \"1-2-2\" or \"2-2-1,\" this weakness was easily exploited.</p> <p>In contrast, the Nuggets have more options to counter zone defense. In addition to pick-and-roll, Joki\u0107 can also play as a facilitator from the high post, disrupting the Heat's defensive formation.</p> <p>Moreover, in Game 3 of the NBA Finals, the Nuggets even used the triangle offense, a tactic commonly seen in European basketball, to break through the zone defense.</p> <p>Despite the fact that every team wants a once-in-a-generation talent or even form a \"Big Three,\" the comparison between the Nuggets and 76ers proves that having an MVP-level player does not guarantee dominance. The key is still finding suitable role players and a diverse tactical system to support the star player's performance.</p> <p>\u203bWill LeBron James become the first player in NBA history to become a team owner as well?

Taiwan's men's basketball team lost to the host Mainland team with a score of 69-89 in the \"Straits Derby\" today, crushing their goal of securing the top spot in the group for the Hangzhou Asian Games. The 39-year-old veteran Wen-Ding Tseng admitted that the team has made progress during their long training period, but \"to be honest, it's still not enough.\"</p> <p>Taiwan's men's basketball team has been training together since June this year, from the Japan training camp to the Jones Cup and a two-week trip to Australia, and now the results at the Hangzhou Asian Games. Although they won their first game against Hong Kong, they struggled with their offense in the first half and suffered a 20-point defeat. Speaking frankly, Tseng, who has returned to the national team, said, \"We have been training for so long and there has been progress, but to be honest, it's still not enough. We need to get better and better and help each other improve in the limited time we have.\"</p> <p>Tseng pointed out the problem, mentioning that all the players on Taiwan's team are key players in their respective clubs, but when they join the national team, they have to change their roles and mindset, and find ways to contribute within the limited time and ball possession. Taiwan's team has been plagued by injuries to their backcourt this year, with their original point guard Ying-Chun Chen absent due to injury, leaving Lin Ting-Qian, who usually plays as a shooting guard, to \"save the day\" and take on the role of commander. He self-critically assessed his performance as a point guard today as \"failing\", and acknowledged the many flaws in the first two games of the group stage, promising to reflect and improve. Lin Ting-Qian, 23, joined the CBA draft in 2020, played for the Tianjin Ronggang Pioneer team, and recently announced his three-year top salary contract extension with Tianjin in July. He has also become the target of Mainland media attention. Lin Ting-Qian mentioned that after three seasons in the CBA, he expected there to be high-intensity physical battles in today's game, but the actual experience on the court was not much different from the CBA. However, the atmosphere at the Asian Games and the CBA league are completely different, and the referees have different standards, making it a unique experience. </p>"},{"location":"20231101091321937079/","title":"Bulls fans can join the \"Chicago Bulls Fan Discussion Group\" for more interaction","text":"<p>Bulls fans can join the \"Chicago Bulls Fan Discussion Group\" for more interaction. For more great articles, please visit the new \"AhUtopian Sports Talk\". If you want to discuss legal and business matters, please go to \"Four Leaf Fish - Lawyer Yu Zongming\". Please continue reading below for an analysis of the season and a review of the preseason game.</p> <p>RegBulls refers to BedBull, also known as the Chicago Bulls in the Regular Season. According to most season predictions, we may not have to consider the playoffs, so I want to take a different approach.</p> <p>In the first game at home, the Bulls started off strong and gave a refreshing performance in the first half. However, they were completely overshadowed by the Thunder in the second half, and it was reported that the players immediately held a meeting with only players in attendance. Let's review this game using the following points.</p> <p>Please continue reading below for \"Stats\": Last season, the Bulls had the lowest three-point attempts per game in the league at 28.9. In this game, they attempted 42 shots, although only 12 were made with a dismal shooting percentage. However, this at least shows that the team is moving towards improving their shot distribution.</p> <p>Please continue reading below for \"Good\": The Bulls outperformed the Thunder in offensive rebounds and steals, which also gave them many more shot opportunities. \"Bad\": They were completely torn apart by the Thunder's Drive and Kick plays in the second half, which led to the Thunder's already hot hands becoming even more dominant. Was this the result of defensive strategy decisions? \"Player\": The player I want to highlight the most in this game is Torrey Craig. His presence allows for more versatility in the Bulls' lineup, and he may be able to pair up with the young wing players to create some bold lineups. \"Moment\": There were three moments that I think are worth mentioning: The first was the first shot of the game, which was a single-handed shot by Patrick Williams. The second was the first three-pointer of the game, which was made by DeMar DeRozan. The third was when Andre Drummond used a crossover move to shake off Chet Holmgren and score.</p> <p>\"Next\": The Raptors, who no longer have Fred VanVleet, have also changed coaches to Darko Rajakovic. Even without tanking, they have managed to maintain a competitive presence in the Eastern Conference with players like Scottie Barnes leading the way and Dennis Schroder, the World Cup MVP.</p>"},{"location":"20231101091327235893/","title":"\u8acb\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5f80\u4e0b\u95b1\u8b80\u6700\u5f8c\u4e00\u9ede\uff0c\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u9ede\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4f86\u770b\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u56de\u6b78\u9019\u4ef6\u4e8b\uff0c\u5c0d\u53f0\u7063\u7c43\u7403\u5e02\u5834\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u9019\u90e8\u5206\u6211\u5148\u524d\u4e5f\u6709\u63d0\u904e\uff0c\u8c6a\u54e5\u56de\u6b78\u5c0dP+\u4f86\u8aaa\u662f\u5929\u5927\u7684\u798f\u97f3\uff0c\u5149\u662f\u65b0\u5317\u570b\u738b\u3001\u92fc\u9435\u4eba\u3001\u733f\u3001\u5922\u60f3\u5bb6\uff0c\u9019\u56db\u500b\u968a\uff0c\u5c31\u6709\u56db\u5bb6\u5a92\u9ad4\uff0c\u6709\u56db\u5bb6\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u6709\u516b\u500b\u5546\u696d\u5925\u4f34\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u505a\u5404\u7a2e\u985e\u578b\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u8c6a\u54e5\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u7c89\u7d72\u9084\u6709\u570b\u5916\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u5925\u4f34\uff0c\u9019\u90e8\u5206\u66ab\u6642\u4e0d\u8a0e\u8ad6\uff0c\u5149\u662f\u5728\u53f0\u7063\uff0c\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u56de\u6b78\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u53f0\u7063\u7c43\u7403\u5e02\u5834\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u8f49\u6298\u9ede\uff0c\u53f0\u7063\u7c43\u7403\u5e02\u5834\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u5341\u5e7e\u5e74\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u9760\u4e00\u500b\u7403\u968a\u5728\u6490\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8aaa\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u53f0\u7063\u7684\u7403\u54e1\u4e0d\u5728\uff0cP+\u7684\u71df\u904b\u5c31\u6703\u53d7\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u9019\u9ede\u6211\u60f3\u5927\u5bb6\u61c9\u8a72\u90fd\u5f88\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u9019\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u8c6a\u54e5\u56de\u6b78\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\uff0c\u5176\u5be6\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\uff0c\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ad9\u51fa\u4f86\u505a\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\uff0c\u9019\u5c0d\u53f0\u7063\u7c43\u7403\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u662f\u592a\u5927\u7684\u4e00\u500b\u8f49\u6298\u9ede\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u8a8d\u70ba\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u56de\u6b78\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u6c7a\u53f0\u7063\u7c43\u7403\u6240\u6709\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u80af\u5b9a\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4ed6\u5e36\u4f86\u7684\u6b63\u9762\u6548\u61c9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8b93\u53f0\u7063\u7c43\u7403\u7e7c\u7e8c\u767c\u5c55\u3002","text":"<p>\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u56de\u6b78\uff0c\u5c0dP+\u548c\u53f0\u7063\u7c43\u7403\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u8f49\u6298\u9ede\uff0c\u5c0d\u570b\u738b\u548c\u8c6a\u54e5\u672c\u4eba\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u6211\u671f\u5f85\u9019\u500b\u7403\u5b63\u7684\u958b\u59cb\uff0c\u4e5f\u671f\u5f85\u8c6a\u54e5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65b0\u5317\u570b\u738b\uff0c\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5c55\u73fe\u4ed6\u7684\u795e\u5947\u9b45\u529b\u3002</p> <p>The 4 Meanings of Jeremy Lin Joining New Taipei Kings:</p> <p>Finally, some good news for Taiwan basketball this year!

Just a few days ago, Jeremy Lin confirmed his return to P.League+, joining his brother with New Taipei Kings. I think Lin's return is a positive development in many ways. Let me use four perspectives to analyze the significance of the \"Lin-sanity\" news and discuss what it means. Please continue reading.</p> <p>First, for the entire Taiwan basketball scene, Lin's return is one of the few 100% positive news of the summer. This summer, Taiwan basketball has been in the spotlight, with the retirement of Lin Chih-chieh, contract disputes involving Lin Ping-sheng, and the recent conflict between the Basketball Association and the Players' Union. While these news items have made for an exciting summer in Taiwanese basketball, whether it is a good or bad thing is open to interpretation. Most of these news items have nothing to do with basketball itself. While it may be entertaining for us to follow along as spectators, from the perspective of the overall basketball environment in Taiwan, I don't think it's healthy for an industry to have this many explosive events in a short period of time.</p> <p>Lin's return, in my personal opinion, can redirect people's attention back to basketball before the season begins. Otherwise, every day the news about Taiwan basketball will be mixed in with social news. To be honest, that's not a good thing. Almost all of the news during the off-season, aside from the World Cup warm-up games and the Jones Cup, have been social news. I hope that Lin's return can shift the focus back to basketball itself. I understand that exposure is good for an emerging industry, but when all the exposure is negative, that's not ideal.</p> <p>In summary, I believe that Lin's return before the season starts can redirect the public's focus back to the court, which is definitely a huge contribution to the Taiwanese sports community.</p> <p>Please continue reading.</p> <p>I mentioned earlier that we need to shift the focus back to basketball itself. Now, let's discuss the impact on the team's strength. First, let's talk about New Taipei Kings. Assuming no injuries, I don't know how this team can lose. Lin's addition to Bank of Taiwan Steel, a team that finished last in the league last year, nearly made the playoffs. Now he is joining last year's runner-up team. What does this mean? Under P.League+'s regulations, Lin is considered a local player due to his Chinese heritage. This means he is not restricted by the fourth-quarter playing time limit and the number of foreign players allowed on the court in each game. This is already a huge advantage. Not to mention that New Taipei also has another foreign player, Davis, who is considered a local player as well. What does this mean? Other teams can only have one foreign player on the court in the fourth quarter, but New Taipei Kings? They can have three.</p> <p>I know many people joke about Taiwan Beer Brave Monkeys as the \"Universal Warriors.\" I have no disrespect towards Mr. Hsu or Mr. Chih, they are definitely legendary figures in Taiwan. Young players like Gu Yuhao and KJ are also very talented. But how do you compare them to Lin? Or to Mullens? There is a gap in terms of strength. Please continue reading.</p> <p>I want to add one more point. Lin's addition is not just an upgrade in terms of strength for Taiwan's basketball teams. How did he transform Bank of Taiwan Steel last season? He improved the team's culture from top to bottom, taught young players how to play, and even helped explain tactics on the court. He is a player, trainer, and assistant coach all in one. With his leadership, do you think the young players on New Taipei Kings, such as Su Shih-hsuan and Chen Chun-nan, have a chance to improve? I believe that Lin's addition to the team will have a huge impact, both on and off the court, and he is definitely a top player in Taiwan.</p> <p>Let me summarize New Taipei Kings' core lineup for next season. First, in the backcourt, they have last year's MVP, Shih Wei, and national team player Kuo Yen-hung. Add to that the super foreign player Lin, and you have the most star-studded backcourt in the league. As for the wings, they have foreign player Manny and a slightly weaker bench, but they still have players who can contribute. Finally, in the paint, they have the league's best foreign player, Mullens, and Q, who is considered a local player but has the strength of 0.8 foreign players. After listing these players, do you feel the strength of this team? Let's look at Bank of Taiwan Steel. Many people say that there's no point in watching them without Lin, but I disagree. Their local lineup is not bad, right? At least it's much better than last season. Bank of Taiwan Steel has added Shi Jin-yao and Chen Guan-quan to their local lineup, which is a big upgrade. Shi Jin-yao was a P.League+ team of the year a few years ago and was supposed to help Taiwan qualify for the Olympics this year. He is recognized by the country as a talented player. Just looking at the local paint, his contribution is second to none. With these two players and Lu Zheng-ru, Bank of Taiwan Steel's mid-level players are not bad. I think they are similar to Taiwan Beer and Dreamers. They also have a young star like Chen You-wei, who played with Lin for half a season and trained with him during the Jones Cup. Is it too much to say that he is a star player in P.League+? Looking at the big picture, I don't think Bank of Taiwan Steel is hopeless. If they can find a better foreign player, someone with strong individual skills, their lineup will be formidable. They could even fight for a playoff spot.</p> <p>Please continue reading.</p> <p>Finally, the most important point. Let's look at the impact of Lin's return on the Taiwan basketball market. I mentioned this earlier, but Lin's return is a godsend for P.League+. With just New Taipei Kings, Bank of Taiwan Steel, Taiwan Beer, and Dreamers, there are four media outlets, four teams, and eight commercial partners that can collaborate on various types of projects. Lin has his own fans and international partners, but let's not discuss that for now. Just in Taiwan, Lin's return is a turning point for the Taiwan basketball market. For the past ten years or so, the market has relied on one team. In other words, if there are no Taiwanese players, P.League+'s operations will be affected. I think everyone is well aware of this. But this time, with Lin's return, we can see that with just one Lin, he can make an impact. This is a huge turning point for the development of Taiwan basketball. I don't believe that Lin's return can solve all the problems in Taiwan basketball, but what is certain is that the positive effects he brings can continue to drive the development of Taiwanese basketball.</p> <p>Lin's return is a turning point for P.League+ and Taiwan basketball. It is also a new challenge for New Taipei Kings and Lin himself. I look forward to the start of this season and I hope that Lin can continue to showcase his magical charm with New Taipei Kings.</p>"},{"location":"20231101091351631918/","title":"NBA\u7f8e\u570b\u8a18\u8005\u5831\u5c0e\uff1aLillard Trade Saga","text":"<p>Damian Lillard    NBA\u7f8e\u570b\u8a18\u8005\u5831\u5c0e\uff1aLillard Trade Saga</p> <p>Damian Lillard.</p> <p>Photo/Reuters</p> <p>The Damian Lillard trade saga was completed early this morning, causing a stir among the entire league. Today, reporter Chris Haynes wrote a lengthy article about the developments of this situation over the past few months.</p> <p>Haynes chronologically details the events of this saga. It started with Lillard expressing his desire to be traded, and the only communication between the Miami Heat and Portland Trail Blazers was during the summer league in early July. However, the Heat wanted to have an in-person meeting to discuss the trade, but it never happened. At this point, the Blazers released a statement saying they would seek the best offer and were not limited to Miami. Lillard's camp then stated that he would only be satisfied if he was traded to the Heat, and the league intervened to mediate the situation. However, there were no updates about this matter after the summer league ended. Lillard's agent, Aaron Goodwin, took action and suggested that Lillard speak with general manager Joe Cronin. Both parties agreed to meet, and during the meeting, Lillard expressed his disappointment with how the situation was being handled. Cronin promised to strive for the most attractive package, but Lillard knew at that moment that he would most likely not be going to the Heat.</p> <p>Haynes even wrote in the article that Lillard told Cronin during the meeting, \"If I can't go to the Heat, then I would rather withdraw the trade and stay with the Blazers.\" Cronin's response was that Lillard could not return to the team.</p> <p>Lillard was surprised to hear this and felt frustrated that he couldn't go back to Portland. He still believed that he might not leave the team, so he continued to train at the Blazers' training center. He told reporters, \"I'm still on the team roster, and I usually train here at this time. I'm not trying to cause any problems. This is not like me. Everyone is happy to see me, except for Cronin. He never talks to me, and when I noticed it, I made up my mind that I wouldn't go to him.\"</p> <p>Lillard's camp felt the need to address this issue urgently, so his agent also approached the Bucks and Nets.</p> <p>The reporter also reported that Bucks GM Jon Horst regularly asked the Blazers if Lillard could be traded, but the answer was always that both GMs wanted their star players to stay on their respective teams. The tension between Lillard's camp and the Blazers' organization continued to escalate, and the league had to hold another coordination meeting to address the issue. The main focus of the meeting was the communication breakdown between the Blazers and Lillard's camp. Cronin promised to improve the communication in the future. In fact, the reporter also mentioned in the article that Cronin intentionally distanced himself from Lillard's camp because he did not want to ruin any potential trades. Finally, the trade was completed before the start of training camp, with the Blazers receiving Deandre Ayton, Jrue Holiday, a first-round pick, and two first-round pick swaps. Holiday could even be traded again to other teams.</p> <p>NBA American reporter report: Lillard Trade Saga. </p>"},{"location":"20231102091126633185/","title":"How Baron Davis Transformed from a Crazy Guard on the Court to a Top Venture Capitalist in the NBA","text":"<p>Simon Baron Davis had a spectacular career on the court, making two All-Star appearances and winning two steals titles    How Baron Davis Transformed from a Crazy Guard on the Court to a Top Venture Capitalist in the NBA</p> <p>Simon Baron Davis had a spectacular career on the court, making two All-Star appearances and winning two steals titles. After retiring in 2017, he became a commentator for NBA games on TNT. However, Davis is not just a basketball player, he is also a low-key top entrepreneur.</p> <p>During his playing career, Davis signed six contracts and earned a total salary of approximately $147 million. However, he did not rely solely on his salary to make money. Davis is currently the founder of multiple companies spanning various industries.</p> <p>From sports content platform Sports Lifestyle in Culture (SLiC) to multimedia company UWish, Davis has his hand in many different ventures.</p> <p>In 2020, when the Taiwan Professional Basketball League, P. LEAGUE+, was established, CEO Chen Chien-chou publicly announced that Baron Davis became a shareholder through the introduction of Silicon Valley Taiwan Help, led by New Taipei City Kings CEO Chen Hsin-sheng.</p> <p>Davis is also a shareholder in the East Asia Super League, which is set to launch a new home and away game format in 2023 and is focused on using content and videos to expand the influence of basketball in Asia.</p> <p>Davis is a representative of players who invest early and enjoy the benefits early. What's more important is that he brings his precise vision from the court into the business world. His first investment was in Vitaminwater. In 2007, Coca-Cola announced that it would acquire Vitaminwater for $4.1 billion, and Davis received a substantial return on his investment. In 2014, Davis became an angel investor for online membership-based retailer Thrive Market, which saw a surge in performance during the pandemic, once again showcasing Davis' successful investment acumen.</p> <p>In 2016, Davis participated in the Series A investment of flower delivery company Bloomthat, which was valued far beyond the initial evaluation. Due to his accurate vision and diligent research, Davis mainly focuses on early-stage investments. His investment selection criteria not only include potential profitability, but also a positive impact on society and minority entrepreneurship.</p> <p>For example, in 2021, he invested in the women's medical cannabis care brand House of Wise. \"I like investing in startups because these companies have the potential to become the next generation of social change agents, moving us towards a better future,\" Davis said. \"I use investing as a way to be a change agent and help these companies have a greater impact.\"</p> <p>\"I have experienced all kinds of teams during my playing career - strong teams, weak opponents, being upset, and being a dark horse that defeats strong teams - so I understand the ups and downs,\" Davis said. \"Now, as a serial entrepreneur, I understand the passion, energy, and determination needed for startups, and I am also willing to take risks and discuss different situations and ways to cope with pressure with these entrepreneurs. My advantage is being bold and detail-oriented.\"</p> <p>Although Davis' talent as a player was not considered top-notch, he has a knack for investing and managing wealth. At the age of 43, Davis can be considered a pioneer in player entrepreneurship. His salary and endorsements during his playing career were not lucrative, but he used his research, investments, and entrepreneurship to forge a new path.</p> <p>Davis may be one of the few retired players who are even busier after retirement, with a busy schedule and budget every season. \"I usually research 25-30 companies per season and invest in five of them,\" Davis said. One of the venture capital firms he owns, Business Inside The Game, mainly invests in minority groups such as Black, women, Middle Eastern or Indian, and LGBTQ+. \"I want to empower them and use investment to amplify the ideas and wills of these minority groups for the majority to understand and benefit from each other's cultures,\" he said. He also founded content branding company Black Santa, creating cross-cultural animated characters and launching exclusive content and merchandise to achieve both profit and public welfare goals. \"I want to bring stories of heroes and cartoon characters to African Americans and all ethnic groups, so that people of all skin colors can identify, unite, and entertain each other.\"</p> <p>However, in addition to investments with a public welfare purpose, Davis is also involved in major business mergers and transactions. In 2020, when Adidas expressed its intention to sell Reebok, Davis and a group of investors led by rapper Master P made a bid.</p> <p>In addition to some mature business models, Davis is also very willing to try new and high-risk investments, such as the Metaverse, Web 3.0, cryptocurrency blockchain games, and NFT. Black Santa released a charity NFT during Christmas in 2021, which sold out in just 14 minutes. \"When faced with this new technology and field, don't be overwhelmed, but try to understand and participate. Technology is just a tool, how to use it is the key,\" Davis said. He believes that Web 3.0 and cryptocurrency are very suitable for professional athletes with a voice and influence, and for creative people who don't like commercialization. \"This is a new opportunity, and everyone has the chance to participate.\" In recent years, Davis has been involved in Web 3.0-related content platforms such as Overtime and Fireside. Davis believes that NBA players themselves have a voice and influence, and with their star power, they can create their own brands and earn wealth and fame like other influencers. However, he does not like to do so. \"I like to help and give back, that is the true value for me,\" Davis said. Former NBA player Brandon Jennings has called Davis the godfather of Los Angeles basketball. \"Besides being a great player, he often comes back to the streets to take care of us. He has always been giving back, especially to his hometown. You can call BD anytime, he will definitely answer the phone.\" Davis' investment enlightenment came from wanting to break away from the exploitation of the professional player industry. \"I feel like I have to be 'robbed'. When I was a rookie, I had no idea, so I needed agents and business managers to assist me. But after my three-year contract was over, I decided to do it myself.\" Davis not only broke the mold by not hiring an agent, but also started thinking about how to invest in himself. He decided to negotiate contracts and build a team to handle commercial activities. \"I'm not afraid to go against tradition, I'm very willing to try new things and break the status quo.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231102091141994490/","title":"In the game between the Golden State Warriors and the New Orleans Pelicans, Stephen Curry led his team with 42 points","text":"<p>In the game between the Golden State Warriors and the New Orleans Pelicans, Stephen Curry led his team with 42 points.

In the first quarter, they fell behind by double digits. Although they gradually recovered in the second quarter and narrowed the gap to 9 points at one point, China extended their lead after the break and ultimately won by 20 points. This was the first defeat for the Chinese Taipei team in this tournament. In this post by Basketball Notes on Instagram, let's continue reading about the lack of execution in fundamentals being the main reason for the loss, rather than the gap in talent and the lack of a point guard for the Chinese Taipei team.</p> <p>However, the lack of execution in fundamentals may be the root cause of the loss. Facing the taller Chinese team, how to overcome the disadvantage in size and maximize their speed advantage was demonstrated by the Chinese Taipei men's basketball team at the World University Games. In this year's Chengdu World University Games, the Chinese Taipei team faced China in the group stage and used continuous pick-and-roll and cutting plays to force China to switch on defense, creating communication flaws and mismatches that allowed their players to take advantage of. However, in the Hangzhou Asian Games, the Chinese Taipei team attempted to use similar tactics, such as the \"Flex\" play, to force China to switch on defense, but the execution was not as effective.</p> <p>They spent a lot of time setting screens and making cuts, but still couldn't create open shots, resulting in an endless cycle of one-on-one plays.</p> <p>Against China's strong defense, the Chinese Taipei team's individual efforts were not efficient. Lin Ting-chien and Liu Chen's shooting percentages were both below 40%, combining for only 18 points. Although Artino scored 20 points, most of them were hard-fought baskets. It's not that the execution of this group of Chinese Taipei players is inferior to the previous World University Games team. After all, the effectiveness of execution is relative and cannot be judged solely based on the results. The higher the opponent's defensive intensity, the greater the challenge for execution.</p> <p>Clearly, the Chinese Taipei team's execution was not enough to handle the adult-level Chinese team's defense. This could be due to the change in coach from Charlie Parker to coach Donewald, which required players to adapt to a new system, coupled with limited training time, resulting in poor execution.</p> <p>If Chen Ying-chun, Lin Wei-han, and Lee Kai-yen were able to play healthy, they could have helped with the team's organization and control of the pace. However, execution also relies on the team's overall understanding and cohesion with the tactics, and adding more point guards may not solve the problem immediately. It still needs to start with the basic training. Moreover, the Chinese Taipei team's personnel deployment and tactical configuration may also have room for improvement.</p> <p>As mentioned in previous articles, since coach Donewald took over the national team, there has been an increase in the ratio of tall players playing as the primary playmakers. However, in this game, China's perimeter defense was very aggressive, making it difficult for the Chinese Taipei team's forwards to receive passes, resulting in the ball being stuck in the hands of the taller players for a long time. The problem is that most of the Chinese Taipei team's big men lack the ability to attack off the dribble, making it hard to pass the ball and also unable to create their own offense, leading to low team offensive efficiency.</p> <p>In order to narrow the gap in size, the Chinese Taipei team usually maintains the traditional lineup of playing two players taller than 200 cm at the same time. However, when the power forwards and centers are not able to provide enough offensive threats, the coaching staff may need to make adjustments and consider using a \"four small and one big\" lineup, with players like Lee Chi-wei playing as the small-ball power forward. After all, coach Donewald has also used Chou Po-chun as a stretch-five, so why not put in a player with a higher three-point shooting percentage to speed up ball movement and create more open shots. Source of photos</p> <p>The Chinese Taipei team's defense in the paint was commendable in this game, as Artino was able to limit China's center Wang Zhelin, forcing him to commit two offensive fouls. Although the Chinese Taipei team was outrebounded by the opponent by 18 offensive rebounds, they only allowed China to score 17 points through second-chance opportunities, not allowing them to rely on their size advantage. The bigger issue for the Chinese Taipei team's defense may have been their lack of focus.</p> <p>Not only in half-court defense, but they were also caught off guard several times by Zhang Zhenlin's backdoor cuts and were slow to get back on defense in transition, allowing China to score 18 fast-break points compared to their 7.</p> <p>When facing a team with better talent, it's even more important to have a solid foundation and play at their own level in order to have a chance to compete. If they can't even display their own abilities, there's no point in talking about narrowing the gap. Therefore, before discussing the talent gap between the Chinese Taipei team and China, it's more important to focus on their cohesion and defensive focus, which are fundamentals.</p>"},{"location":"20231102091155488665/","title":"In the game today, Christian Wood (right) helped the Lakers defeat the Magic 106-103 at home","text":"<p>In the game today, Christian Wood (right) helped the Lakers defeat the Magic 106-103 at home.

It seems that China's strategy for the group stage is to let young players gain experience first and then switch to their main players when needed. The Chinese team initially took advantage of the opportunity and led 7-5 in the beginning.</p> <p>However, as China increased their defensive pressure, the Chinese team began to struggle on the offensive end. They started making some poor offensive choices, such as Lu Junxian repeatedly being blocked while attempting to drive after a screen, and Zeng Xiangjun hesitating to attack the basket and instead attempting difficult mid-range shots that were all missed.</p> <p>In the second half of the first quarter, the Chinese team fell into a long scoring drought. Facing China's higher-intensity defense, the pick-and-roll combination of Lin Tingqian and Atino became ineffective. The Chinese players' footwork in screening was unmatched by Hong Kong or Chinese Taipei players, making Atino's screening less effective. This allowed the defender to always stay in front of Lin Tingqian, making it difficult for him to pass to open teammates in time, resulting in delayed passes and the defender being able to recover and defend. Additionally, China's three-point shooting was much better in this game compared to their previous game, with a 48% three-point shooting percentage. The Chinese team tried to use a zone defense to limit the pressure in the paint, but China's accurate three-point shooting was unexpected. Du Runwang made 5 out of 8 three-pointers, helping China build a lead early on. The Chinese team's rotation on defense still needs improvement, as they often left open spaces on the perimeter due to trying to help defend against drives, allowing China to make open three-point shots.</p> <p>In addition, China's substitute Zhao Jiwei displayed his speed and steady ball handling skills, causing trouble for the Chinese team's defense. He scored 19 points, grabbed 5 rebounds, and dished out 7 assists, constantly running past the Chinese team's defense during their offensive struggles and finding open teammates or scoring himself.</p> <p>Although some may criticize Atino for not defending on the perimeter, I personally agree with his decision to stay in the paint. If he were to defend on the perimeter, there would be almost no one left to defend China's inside players. Atino did a good job controlling his emotions in this game and fulfilled his role as a protector of the paint.</p> <p>The Chinese team's rebounding was not inferior to China's, thanks to Atino's ability to box out and limit the Chinese team's center. He also grabbed 6 offensive rebounds on the offensive end, creating problems for China's defense and giving his teammates opportunities to score from the outside.</p> <p>Today, Atino truly lived up to his nickname of \"God of Defense.\" Source: Chinese Olympic Committee The Chinese team's main source of offense came from their defense and fast breaks. Liu Zheng and Abass constantly applied pressure on the Chinese players, disrupting their offensive rhythm and causing them to miss shots, which the Chinese team converted into fast break points. Abass also used his speed to score in transition.</p> <p>He displayed the Chinese team's most scarce individual offensive ability. Despite facing taller Chinese players, he was still able to score with his pace and athleticism. However, he needs to improve on controlling the tempo, as he had 4 turnovers in this game which wasted scoring opportunities.</p> <p>Facing a strong opponent like China, it is not surprising that the Chinese team lost. The key is for us to recognize our weaknesses and find ways to improve.</p> <p>In my opinion, the biggest flaw in this game was not putting pressure on China in the backcourt. It is well known that China lacks the ability to control the tempo of their offense. If the opponent pressures their backcourt and forces them to pass the ball early, their shot selection will be greatly affected. Today, besides Liu Zheng, the other players were content with just standing in front of the Chinese players and not defending them closely. They should have put more pressure on the Chinese players, especially Zhao Jiwei who ran all over the court. Apart from Liu Zheng, the other players also need to step up on defense. Additionally, the local league players lacked confidence and could not utilize their strengths.</p> <p>Lu Junxian, knowing that he was at a height disadvantage against his opponent, was constantly blocked and struggled in the beginning. Luckily, he realized this problem and started using screens to make two three-pointers, finally finding his offensive rhythm.</p> <p>As for Zeng Xiangjun, his height should not be a disadvantage against anyone except for a power forward. However, he was forced to take difficult shots to avoid being blocked. He only scored 1 point in the end. Other local league players also encountered similar difficulties, becoming hesitant and playing even worse against the high-intensity game.</p> <p>Source: Chinese Olympic Committee In the next game, the Chinese team will face Mongolia, who just lost by 5 points to Hong Kong. This should be a good opportunity for the Chinese team to gain experience. Hopefully, the players can regain their confidence on both ends of the court and prepare for more intense games in the future.</p>"},{"location":"20231102091215083882/","title":"\u7576\u7136\u9019\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u7d66Lillard\u5168\u8cac\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u4ed6\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u9084\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u512a\u79c0\uff0c\u7e3d\u6559\u7df4\u5728\u4e00\u500b\u500b\u66ab\u505c\u4ee5\u5f8c\u4e5f\u7d66\u4e86\u4ed6\u5f88\u591a\u6a5f\u6703\u53bb\u5598\u606f\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5728\u6700\u5f8c\u4e00\u523b\u4e5f\u662f\u70ba\u4ed6\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u6027\u7684\u9032\u653b\u6230\u8853\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u6642\u5019\u6bd4\u8cfd\u5c31\u662f\u9019\u9ebc\u6b98\u9177\uff0c\u7576\u4f60\u9000\u4e0b\u4f86\u7684\u6642\u5019\uff0c\u5c0d\u624b\u5c31\u6703\u627e\u5230\u4f60\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u8655\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e0d\u7ba1\u9019\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u6700\u5f8c\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u90fd\u5fc5\u9808\u80af\u5b9a\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u9019\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u7684\u52dd\u5229\u4e26\u4e0d\u662f\u9760\u8457\u500b\u5225\u7403\u54e1\u6216\u662f\u5e78\u904b\u624d\u5f97\u4f86\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u6574\u500b\u7403\u968a\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u548c\u62fc\u640f\u3002","text":"<p>\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u540c\u5fd7\u5011\uff0c\u516c\u9e7f\u968a\u7684\u5206\u6790\u9769\u547d\u5c1a\u672a\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4ecd\u9808\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u671f\u5f85\u4ed6\u5011\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u80fd\u5920\u518d\u6b21\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u529b\u548c\u6230\u9b25\u7cbe\u795e\uff01</p> <p>The Milwaukee Bucks, who were the top seed in the league last season, faced the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs    \u7576\u7136\u9019\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u7d66Lillard\u5168\u8cac\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u4ed6\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u9084\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u512a\u79c0\uff0c\u7e3d\u6559\u7df4\u5728\u4e00\u500b\u500b\u66ab\u505c\u4ee5\u5f8c\u4e5f\u7d66\u4e86\u4ed6\u5f88\u591a\u6a5f\u6703\u53bb\u5598\u606f\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5728\u6700\u5f8c\u4e00\u523b\u4e5f\u662f\u70ba\u4ed6\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e86\u4e00\u500b\u95dc\u9375\u6027\u7684\u9032\u653b\u6230\u8853\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u6642\u5019\u6bd4\u8cfd\u5c31\u662f\u9019\u9ebc\u6b98\u9177\uff0c\u7576\u4f60\u9000\u4e0b\u4f86\u7684\u6642\u5019\uff0c\u5c0d\u624b\u5c31\u6703\u627e\u5230\u4f60\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u8655\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e0d\u7ba1\u9019\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u6700\u5f8c\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u90fd\u5fc5\u9808\u80af\u5b9a\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u9019\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u7684\u52dd\u5229\u4e26\u4e0d\u662f\u9760\u8457\u500b\u5225\u7403\u54e1\u6216\u662f\u5e78\u904b\u624d\u5f97\u4f86\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u6574\u500b\u7403\u968a\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u548c\u62fc\u640f\u3002</p> <p>\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u540c\u5fd7\u5011\uff0c\u516c\u9e7f\u968a\u7684\u5206\u6790\u9769\u547d\u5c1a\u672a\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4ecd\u9808\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u671f\u5f85\u4ed6\u5011\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u80fd\u5920\u518d\u6b21\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u5be6\u529b\u548c\u6230\u9b25\u7cbe\u795e\uff01</p> <p>The Milwaukee Bucks, who were the top seed in the league last season, faced the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs. It was a legendary matchup that had not happened in ten years, and the Heat managed to defeat the Bucks despite missing their starting player, Tyler Herro.</p> <p>It was a moment that brought back the despair of the \"Bubble\" era for the Bucks. But let's continue reading about the new challenges ahead. If we want to say what the Bucks have learned from last year's defeat, it is that we will never give up easily.</p> <p>During the off-season, the Bucks successfully acquired Damian Lillard in a battle with the Miami Heat. The team also made a decision to dismantle their old defensive system and focus on a more aggressive offense.</p> <p>Lillard's offensive value may not have been as dominant as in previous games against the Atlanta Hawks, where he was limited to only 10 points for the fourth time in his career. However, in this game against the Miami Heat, although Lillard's performance on paper may not seem as strong as before, a closer look reveals that he still posed a big threat to the Heat.</p> <p>In pick-and-roll situations, whether Lillard or Giannis Antetokounmpo initiates the offense, the Heat mostly double-teams, making it difficult for Lillard to get easy shots or driving opportunities. Lillard also knows when to pass to his teammates when facing the double-team, which can be seen in the game when Giannis gets the ball near the free throw line. Even though the Heat have shooters in the left and right corners, they still choose to double-team Giannis. And Giannis, after reading the defense, knows that the player guarding the paint, Bryant, has been pulled out, and Butler has been faked out with a big step, leaving the defender under the basket vulnerable. Although Lillard's ability to attract defenders and make the right pass is crucial, it is ultimately Giannis who executes the play with his strength and power.</p> <p>If it were someone like Crowder, who has less individual ability, even if he attracts defenders, he won't be able to finish on his own, and will become a \"passing point\" for the second time. Therefore, it may not show in traditional statistics, but Lillard is actually activating the team's ball movement. As the saying goes, \"children play from the three-point line, adults dominate the paint.\"</p> <p>If we were to compare the two former and current head coaches, Mike Budenholzer and Adrian Griffin, the biggest difference would be in \"discipline\" and \"efficiency\". It's not to say that Griffin's team lacks discipline, but he allows his stars to have more freedom to try their favorite scoring methods.</p> <p>The most obvious change is seen in the team's sixth man, Bobby Portis. Under Budenholzer's coaching, he relied on his excellent outside shooting and positioned himself in the corners for catch-and-shoot opportunities or to set screens and then pop out to the three-point line. This made his job very simple and efficient, and his overall statistics improved significantly, earning him a spot in the top three for the Sixth Man of the Year award.</p> <p>This change is not necessarily a bad thing, but it places too much emphasis on efficiency, causing the team to struggle when facing adversity, forgetting the players' individual strengths, and ultimately leading to self-destruction. In this game against the Heat, Portis perfectly demonstrated his agility and skill in the low post, taking advantage of the lack of experienced big men in the paint for the young Heat players, and using his size to overpower them. Defensively, he was also active in pressuring the offense, often seen using his body to trap opponents and force turnovers, then initiating fast breaks.</p> <p>In the final quarter, the team let their guard down and almost blew the game. When the lead reached over 20 points, it was evident that the players were complacent. At the same time, the Heat picked up the pace and made a furious comeback, forcing the coach to quickly put the starters back in to secure the win. The team's lack of rhythm on offense was one of the reasons for the Heat's comeback. Lillard's ball-handling and initiating were reduced, and he was relegated to a weak-side corner shooter. The other four players kept passing the ball around the perimeter, which was neither effective nor threatening. This allowed the Heat to get more steals and score on fast breaks. Meanwhile, Herro, who has been in the center of trade rumors all summer, was on fire, making all kinds of mid-range jumpers and taking advantage of our weak backcourt defense and Lopez's flaws.</p> <p>Of course, this is not to blame Lillard. His performance was still excellent, and the coach gave him plenty of rest during timeouts. He even designed a crucial play for him in the final seconds. But sometimes, that's just how cruel the game can be. When you take a break, the opponent finds another one of your weaknesses. Regardless of the outcome of this game, we must acknowledge that the victory was not achieved through individual players or luck, but through the team's efforts and resilience.</p> <p>So, comrades, the Bucks' analysis revolution has not succeeded yet, and we still need to work hard. Let's look forward to their future games, where they will once again show their strength and fighting spirit!</p>"},{"location":"20231102091230350064/","title":"\u5728\u9019\u500b\u4f11\u8cfd\u671f\uff0cMorant\u6539\u8b8a\u4e86\u8a13\u7df4\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u9ad4\u80fd\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6e9d\u901a\uff0c\u8b93\u4ed6\u548c\u968a\u53cb\u4e4b\u9593\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u4ed6\u4e5f\u8868\u793a\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u5e7e\u500b\u6708\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u5b78\u7fd2\u5982\u4f55\u6210\u70ba\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9818\u8896\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u7403\u5834\u4e0a\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u66f4\u6210\u719f\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002Morant\u7684\u7981\u8cfd\u671f\u9593\u5df2\u7d93\u904e\u53bb\u4e00\u6bb5\u6642\u9593\u4e86\uff0c\u4ed6\u73fe\u5728\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u548c\u7403\u968a\u4e00\u8d77\u7df4\u7403\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u7b2c26\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u56de\u6b78\u5834\u4e0a\uff0c\u8b93\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u770b\u5230\u4ed6\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002","text":"<p>During the suspension of Memphis Grizzlies' GM Ja Morant, he is allowed to practice with the team and travel with them to away games, according to Grizzlies' General Manager Zach Kleiman    \u5728\u9019\u500b\u4f11\u8cfd\u671f\uff0cMorant\u6539\u8b8a\u4e86\u8a13\u7df4\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u9ad4\u80fd\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6e9d\u901a\uff0c\u8b93\u4ed6\u548c\u968a\u53cb\u4e4b\u9593\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\u3002\u4ed6\u4e5f\u8868\u793a\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u5e7e\u500b\u6708\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u5b78\u7fd2\u5982\u4f55\u6210\u70ba\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9818\u8896\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u7403\u5834\u4e0a\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u66f4\u6210\u719f\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002Morant\u7684\u7981\u8cfd\u671f\u9593\u5df2\u7d93\u904e\u53bb\u4e00\u6bb5\u6642\u9593\u4e86\uff0c\u4ed6\u73fe\u5728\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u548c\u7403\u968a\u4e00\u8d77\u7df4\u7403\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u7b2c26\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u56de\u6b78\u5834\u4e0a\uff0c\u8b93\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u770b\u5230\u4ed6\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002 </p> <p>During the suspension of Memphis Grizzlies' GM Ja Morant, he is allowed to practice with the team and travel with them to away games, according to Grizzlies' General Manager Zach Kleiman.

He also improved his communication with his teammates, building better relationships. He also mentioned that he has been learning how to be a better leader and hopes to show a more mature performance on the court.

The game used ANGO's innovative \"light-up ball,\" which amazed her and left a deep impression of the brand. During her time at Videoland Sports, she saw ANGO's sponsorship of the Taiwan Enterprise Football League, where teams like Taiwan Power and Tatung wore ANGO jerseys. This sparked her interest in getting to know ANGO and discovering that it is not just a sports equipment manufacturer, but also a developer of high-quality jerseys for both football and basketball, providing athletes with more diverse options. Read on to find out what happens when a new generation sports anchor meets a new generation sports brand and jersey, and what kind of new imagination it brings to the sports industry and Taiwan's athletic scene.</p> <p>As a long-time sports anchor, Li Yi-Han has always been interested in sports, starting from high school where she played basketball and even joined her university's basketball team. Her first job after entering the workforce was as a sports journalist, showing her close relationship with sports. Therefore, she has a unique perspective when it comes to the influence of sports brands.</p> <p>\"I know that this year's JHBL (Junior High Basketball League) has collaborated with ANGO, where they sponsored customized jerseys, warm-up gear, and socks for the players. I think this is a great thing. It not only means that JHBL has gained recognition, but also shows that more people will see the strength of Taiwan's sports brands, creating a mutual support and benefit.\"</p> <p>Having experienced playing basketball during her school years, Li Yi-Han understands the importance of sponsorships and encouragement for student teams. This is why she highly praises ANGO's efforts in supporting grassroots sports, such as providing balls and jerseys.</p> <p>Although ANGO initially focused on the football market, they have recently expanded into the basketball scene, providing high-quality jerseys for more athletes to perform at their best. Despite the expansion, ANGO maintains an environmentally-friendly manufacturing process, which impresses Li Yi-Han and shows the brand's determination in protecting the environment.</p> <p>Just like how a perfect jersey not only focuses on the athletes but also the entire industry and manufacturing environment. If a brand can also have a friendly attitude towards the environment, it not only benefits the sports industry but also helps the Earth.</p> <p>A jersey not only represents a team, but also a spirit. Having reported countless sports events, Li Yi-Han chose to enter this industry not only because of her curiosity and admiration for TV work but also her passion and love for sports. She has come a long way to where she is today, even earning the title of \"Cutest Anchor,\" which reflects her genuine enthusiasm and professionalism towards her work.</p> <p>Enthusiasm and determination are essential sports spirits. \"I think work is just like sports, where you must continuously improve your professionalism and skills.\" Li Yi-Han has a serious and determined attitude, even though she has become a celebrity due to her anchor role, often being scrutinized and facing online criticism. She is willing to change her mindset and continue to challenge herself. \"My next goal is to improve my skills in broadcasting sports events, especially hoping to have the opportunity to cover more basketball events that I love, and one day, I hope to report live from the Olympics.\"</p> <p>Li Yi-Han has a clear goal in mind, and her eyes light up when she talks about it, as if she is about to make a perfect shot.

Vassell\u7684\u8056\u57ce\u5b9a\u4f4d</p> <p>Devin Vassell recently signed a huge contract extension, which will keep him with the Spurs for a long time to come.</p> <p>The Spurs have also signed long-term deals with Vassell and Keldon Johnson, and have promising young players like Jeremy Sochan and Victor Wembanyama who could become foundational pieces for the team, as their rookie contracts have yet to expire.</p> <p>This moment gives a sense of continuity. Vassell will soon realize that a high salary brings more attention, especially since his salary will reach up to $30 million next season. However, when it comes to NBA contracts, it is always better to take a step back and understand the context before drawing any conclusions about whether the contract is good or bad. And at the moment, Vassell's contract looks like a good one. Please continue reading to find out why.</p> <p>For a player of Vassell's caliber, this extension is a great deal. In today's NBA, contract values sometimes seem absurd, so it is understandable that some people may have scoffed at the news of a five-year, $146 million contract. Vassell is a wing player who has only performed well for half a season and does not possess any exceptional skills.</p> <p>However, looking beyond these facts, his contract is actually quite reasonable. Vassell will receive a huge sum, but in NBA standards, it is not that much. His base salary would have ranked 46th in the league last season, and that does not even include any potential changes in the free agent market next summer, where he could potentially be pushed down to the 50s.</p> <p>But now his salary will be on par with players like Jerami Grant, Kristaps Porzingis, and Jordan Poole. If he stays healthy, this at least does not seem unreasonable. However, are there players in the league who perform better but earn less? Please continue reading for the answer. Of course, it is possible, but that is just how things work in the NBA - timing is everything.</p> <p>Some players may still have contracts from when the salary cap was lower or when they had yet to prove their value. Looking at the bigger picture, it seems like Vassell is receiving a fair amount. Of course, things could go wrong - he could regress or get injured - but he could also exceed the value of his contract. In the previous season, when Vassell was healthy and able to play, he averaged 18 points, 4 rebounds, and 3+ assists per game, while also making 39 three-pointers. In addition, he showed a certain level of shot-creating ability and has yet to fully tap into his potential as a defender.</p> <p>Photo Credit: Getty Images If Vassell can master the step-back three-pointer, use his added muscle on defense, and make better shots near the basket, he can easily become an excellent two-way player whose value surpasses his salary.</p> <p>At 23 years old, with talent and a strong work ethic, it is reasonable to expect Vassell to improve with experience, which is why the length of his contract is also reasonable. The Spurs should still have plenty of cap space next season Please continue reading It would be shortsighted to focus solely on Vassell's contract, as it is important to consider the team's salary as a whole.</p> <p>There are always opportunity costs when it comes to positions and salaries, so it is not wise to just look at this contract without considering the bigger picture. Luckily, the overall situation looks good.</p> <p>Vassell's new contract will take effect next season, and his on-court value will far exceed his cap hold, which will affect the Spurs' cap space. Extending the contract rather than waiting has two major benefits. First, if Vassell stays healthy, he could play a full professional season and become a restricted free agent, or simply sign a shorter contract to re-enter the market earlier.</p> <p>By signing him now, the Spurs can avoid this risk. Also, signing him now shows their commitment to Vassell, which can maintain a good relationship between the team and player. There have been reports that in the past, the Spurs had several promising players who were dissatisfied with having to wait until they became restricted free agents to get a salary bump, including Kawhi Leonard. Now, creating enough cap space to make a splash in the free agent market and reaching an agreement with restricted free agents early are equally important.</p> <p>In the past, the Spurs had to wait for Kawhi because their priority was to get LaMarcus Aldridge.</p> <p>Now, even with Vassell's contract, the Spurs' current contracts are only around $102 million, which is $40 million below the salary cap.</p> <p>The salary cap will limit them, but the only potential issue is Zach Collins' contract of around $15 million. The Spurs also have some non-guaranteed or partially guaranteed contracts, so they could easily get rid of the $15 million problem by waiving Devont\u00e9 Graham, Julian Champagnie, and Charles Bassey.</p> <p>Although they are unlikely to go all-in on a major player, they should have enough cap space if they want to do so.</p> <p>Retaining Vassell was the right decision, and it will allow the Spurs to continue their development in the coming years. Vassell has the potential to become an excellent wing player, and he is a young player with a great attitude, something that is valued highly in the Spurs organization. If he can stay healthy and continue to improve, this contract will be a great value for the team. It also shows the Spurs' long-term plan and their confidence in building a competitive team, with Vassell being an important piece of that puzzle.</p>"},{"location":"20231103091226407374/","title":"Greenblood Ubon Trade: It's Time for a Holiday","text":"<p>The trade between the Celtics and the Blazers has brought about significant changes for the Celtics    Greenblood Ubon Trade: It's Time for a Holiday</p> <p>The trade between the Celtics and the Blazers has brought about significant changes for the Celtics. Let's take a closer look at the details of the trade:</p> <p>Celtics Receive: Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams III, 2024 Warriors First Round Pick (acquired through the KP trade), 2029 Celtics First Round Pick (unprotected)</p> <p>Blazers Receive: Jrue Holiday</p> <p>Team Roster and Salary:</p> <p>After the trade and the signing of Gabriel, the team's salary has exceeded the Super-Tax Apron. However, some restrictions and penalties will not be implemented until next year, so it all depends on how much the owner is willing to pay for luxury tax. The Celtics now have four starting players with contracts worth over $30 million, but their bench depth has significantly decreased compared to last year.</p> <p>Team Salary: 1. Jrue Holiday - $36,861,707 2. Kristaps Porzingis - $36,016,200 3. Jayson Tatum - $32,600,060 4. Jaylen Brown - $31,830,357 5. Derrick White - $18,357,143 6. Al Horford - $10,000,000 7. Payton Pritchard - $4,037,278 8. Luke Kornet - $2,413,304 (non-guaranteed) 9. Oshae Brissett - $2,165,000 10. Svi Mykhailiuk - $2,019,706 (non-guaranteed) 11. Dalano Banton - $2,019,706 (non-guaranteed) 12. Sam Hauser - $1,927,896 13. Jordan Walsh - $1,119,563</p> <p>Total salary of the above 13 players: $181,367,920 2023 Super-Tax Apron: $182,794,000</p> <p>With only a $1.4 million difference from the Super-Tax Apron, there is not even enough space for a minimum salary player. Unless the team can make another trade to reduce their salary, they are likely to exceed the Super-Tax Apron. This is also the reason why this trade does not seem like a move made by Brad Stevens. Based on the owner Wyc's past decisions, it is unlikely that he will give the green light for such a risky move. The window for winning a championship is fleeting, but taking such a big risk is not worth it. From the contract extension of Brown to the KP trade, I thought the team was willing to make changes while also considering the team's depth. Is this trade really just a reaction to the Bucks' strengthening? It's worth thinking about.</p> <p>Team Roster:</p> <p>A team can have up to 20 players in training camp. With 13 players on the official roster and three two-way contracts, the remaining four spots will likely be filled by players on training camp contracts. The team has already signed three players for training camp: L. Stevens, W. Gabriel, and K. Kelley. The first two have Exhibit 9 contracts, and the latter has an Exhibit 10 contract. It is expected that the remaining spots will be filled by one of these three players.</p> <p>The training camp has already begun, so it's unlikely that the team will sign any more players. To maintain flexibility, they may only fill one of the remaining two spots. Originally, I would have chosen Stevens without hesitation, but now with a gap in the frontcourt, Gabriel may have an advantage. However, I don't believe he will have a significant impact on defense in the frontcourt. I would rather trust Kornet's abilities.</p> <p>Impact of M. Brogdon and R. Williams III leaving:</p> <p>Brogdon won the Sixth Man of the Year award last year and is indeed an efficient scorer. He provides stability and always makes the right decisions off the bench, which is crucial. However, his performance in organizing the offense is not as good as others expected. Of course, it's not entirely his fault. He is capable of handling the ball and organizing the offense through pick-and-rolls, but it's not the Celtics' primary strategy and not the most efficient one.</p> <p>To me, Brogdon is better at driving to the basket and shooting threes. His speed and finishing ability are top-notch, and his three-point shooting is at a high level. Given his position and salary, we can't ask for more from him, but he won't be the one to take over in crucial moments and lead the team to victory.</p> <p>As for Williams III, this is the key reason why I disagree with this trade. First, he has an average salary of only $12 million for the next three years, so he's not a salary cap burden. Second, he finally established himself last year, and despite his meniscus surgery, he still had a significant impact on defense in the frontcourt. Not to mention his playmaking and potential for outside shooting. I don't believe his injury is the reason why the team decided to trade him so early. Especially with the arrival of Porzingis, it's clear that Horford will take a back seat, and Williams III won't have to carry the load of a center. Now, with Horford gone, there is no one else who can take on that role.</p> <p>In conclusion, I don't think this was a fair trade, but we must continue to support our team and hope for another successful season ahead! </p>"},{"location":"20231103091238883792/","title":"NBALillard If I were KD, I wouldn't have gone to the Warriors","text":"<p>NBALillard If I were KD, I wouldn't have gone to the Warriors.

After a tough loss to Nengren Commercial and Industrial High School and Songshan High School, in the final game against Zhiping High School, they were reversed by their opponents after leading by a large margin, marking the end of their season in the preliminaries. After the end of the last school year, Keelung Commercial bid farewell to ten of the twelve players on the starting lineup, who were all seniors, and welcomed major changes in their lineup. In the 112th school year, Keelung Commercial is going through a difficult new beginning.</p> <p>Please continue reading. In the qualifying round, as many as thirteen players will be stepping onto the HBL stage for the first time. Compared to other strong teams, Keelung Commercial showed some immaturity in the various cup competitions last summer, and when facing teams like Songshan High School, who put a lot of pressure on them physically, they would appear flustered. Coach Zhang Lijie also admitted that the team's adjustments towards the end of the summer were just passing. Zhang Lijie pointed out that the tall players on the team are still only sophomores, so they need to improve their awareness of positioning and rebounding, as well as the team's overall understanding of attacking and defending, and their ability to adapt to changing defenses. However, he also affirmed the players' ability to absorb and adjust during the game. \"They won't give up even when faced with adversity, and they are slowly absorbing and executing what we need during timeouts. Their execution has been improving, and while I can't say they have caught up with all the other teams, I believe they will be in good shape before the start of the qualifying round.\" \"When we recruit players, we find that many people think Keelung is too far away, but there are still many kids who are willing to come and have potential,\" Zhang Lijie said. \"I have confidence in this group of freshmen and sophomores. They have all the necessary qualities and are moldable, but they lack experience. So this year, I hope they can gain experience first and quickly have the ability to compete with other teams.\" As a player, Zhang Lijie played under coaches such as Liao Wenbin, Chen Ziwei, and Wang Zhiqun. He was known for his aggressive and fierce defense. After becoming a coach, he also took the defensive system he learned from several famous coaches as the core of the team. However, after joining Keelung Commercial, known for its explosive offense, he began to gradually adjust his training methods in order to find a perfect balance between offense and defense.</p> <p>\"Defense is my strong suit, and it has a significant proportion in our training. But Keelung Commercial has always been a team that loves to run and gun, with a traditional style. Coming here, I also have to blend into this culture, so in the past, defense may have taken up 80% of our training, but now it will be adjusted to 60%.\" Photo: Senior guard Chen Pinlun will be the commander of the backcourt for Keelung Commercial in the 112th school year. Looking at the team structure of Keelung Commercial in the 112th school year, the starting lineup includes left-handed guard Chen Pinlun, as well as the Chen brothers, Chen Weijie and Chen Weihan, who have experience playing in the National Junior High School Division II tournament. Among the seven sophomores, four are over 184cm tall. Among them, Yang Yihuan, a 190cm forward from Tzu Chi Junior High School, although a bit slender, has excellent mobility and may become the X-factor in helping the team break through. Based on the overall condition of Keelung Commercial this year, it can be expected that they will face significant challenges due to their lack of experience. However, Zhang Lijie has previously helped Tai-Shan High School win the championship and led Jinhe High School to create a dark horse legend. Whether he can continue to lead the team to progress and overcome obstacles in the games will be a key focus of the 112th HBL qualifying round. Follow Sports Vision for more in-depth sports coverage.

Keep reading While people often think of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray when talking about the Nuggets, the opening game victory was achieved by three players working together, and the final piece to the puzzle was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. We will take a look at how the Nuggets made their opponents helpless through snippets of their tactical execution from the opening game. The following clip is from when there was a little over five minutes left in the game and the Lakers had narrowed the gap to seven points.</p> <p>The tactic starts with Jokic setting a screen for KCP, who then moves to the top of the arc.</p> <p>Murray then passes the ball to Jokic, who sets another screen for KCP.</p> <p>Taking advantage of the Lakers' communication breakdown, two defenders leave KCP open for a layup, while also giving Murray an open opportunity for a three-pointer.</p> <p>In the next offensive possession, the Nuggets start with the same initial move. Jokic sets a screen for KCP, who then sets a screen for Murray and uses Jokic as a screen himself. Once again, the Lakers are a step behind, allowing KCP to have an open mid-range jump shot. Keep reading Yes, you read that right. The next offensive possession, which occurred just 30 seconds after the previous one, uses the same starting move.</p> <p>Jokic sets a screen for KCP, who then sets a screen for Murray, but this time, there is a new twist.</p> <p>KCP cuts in after setting the screen, slipping between Jokic and Murray. After a hand-off between Murray and Jokic, Murray draws three defenders, leaving an easy pass for Aaron Gordon to make a dunk.</p> <p>After three consecutive successful offensive possessions using the same tactic, the Nuggets once again use the same pattern.</p> <p>Jokic sets a screen for KCP, who then sets a traditional high pick-and-roll with Murray. Murray lobs the ball to Jokic, who immediately passes it to Michael Porter Jr., who easily makes a three-pointer. Four different players scored in four consecutive possessions, expanding their lead from seven to 14 points, effectively putting the Lakers in a tough spot and almost killing the game. Having the best player in the world is certainly a big advantage for the Nuggets, but it is worth noting that Jokic did not score at all during these critical possessions. The reason the Nuggets could easily score was that they knew how to read the defense and react accordingly, with each player knowing their role and using their individual offensive abilities to their advantage. After a championship run and a full, healthy training camp, the Nuggets' offense may once again reach a new level.</p> <p>This tactic may not be the most perfect one, but it perfectly showcases a team with great chemistry and how they can find different variations within the same tactic to create good scoring opportunities for different players.</p> <p>As the season progresses, it will be exciting to see what different tactics the defending champions will use to take advantage of their innate strengths and become a formidable team in the league.

The United Daily News special correspondent Zeng Si-ru reported live from Hangzhou.</p> <p>Special correspondent Ji Xiang-ru photographed the key battle of the Hangzhou Asian Games men's basketball tournament, in which the Chinese team, although able to resist the host team's tall line-up inside the court, struggled on the outside and were bombarded with 15 three-pointers by the mainland team, ultimately succumbing to their first defeat with a score of 69:89. In order to secure the second place in the group, the Chinese team must win their final match against Mongolia. Team manager Zeng Wen-ding has issued a \"must-win\" order, and head coach Sang Mao-sen has also pointed out the key points. Sang Mao-sen mentioned that the opponent, China, had an absolute height advantage today. Throughout the game, the Chinese team's main focus was on protecting the inside, but they missed many defensive rebounds, allowing the host to grab offensive rebounds and convert them into outside attacks. He added, \"Our biggest problem is that every player on our team was marked when creating opportunities, and the chances were not as good.\" Despite losing by 20 points, Sang Mao-sen still praised the Chinese team's fighting spirit, but there is still room for improvement in defensive communication and rotation. There are a total of 16 teams participating in the men's basketball tournament at the Asian Games, divided into four groups in the preliminary round. The group leaders will directly advance to the quarter-finals, while the second and third place teams will compete in cross-matches for the remaining four spots in the quarter-finals. The Chinese team will face Mongolia in their final match, and a victory will secure their second place in the group. The Chinese team does not have much knowledge about Mongolia, but they have done their homework on their previous match against China. Sang Mao-sen believes that their opponents will be active and have a positive attitude in the next match, and the Chinese team's disadvantage in height today may turn into an advantage in the next match. In order to have a chance to play their strong suit of transition attacks, the Chinese team must defend the rebounds well against Mongolia.</p> <p>Mongolia also played against Hong Kong at the same time tonight, and ultimately lost 64:69, giving Hong Kong, who replaced Lebanon in the Asian Games, their first victory. Currently, they have the same record as the Chinese team, with one win and one loss.</p> <p>In terms of strength, Hong Kong is unlikely to challenge the host in their final match, which means that the

Head coach Tom Maoson stated that all players are currently in good health. Despite being in the same group as the host China, their goal is still to come out on top in the group stage. In the preliminary rounds, the Chinese team was originally placed in Group B with China, Lebanon, and Mongolia, with the top team in the group advancing directly to the quarter-finals. The second and third teams will compete for the remaining two spots. However, Lebanon recently withdrew from the competition and was replaced by Hong Kong, who will be the Chinese team's opponent in their first game on the evening of the 26th.</p> <p>Maoson mentioned that although their first opponent has changed from Lebanon to Hong Kong, which is a completely different team, there will still be challenges as it is the Asian Games. The team must approach every game with a normal mindset. In the second game against China and the third game against Mongolia, their goal is still to come out on top in the group stage.</p> <p>One concern for the Chinese team's goal of topping their group is the uncertainty surrounding naturalized player Attinuo's eligibility to play. Maoson said, \"We've heard that there will be a team leaders' meeting to make the final confirmation. We asked the team's management yesterday, but we haven't received any news. It seems like he can play, but we still have to wait for the team leaders' meeting.\" The Chinese team has also prepared for the worst-case scenario. If Attinuo is unable to play, besides Li Dewei, who is originally a center, power forward Zeng Wendong will also have to take on the role of a key player. However, Attinuo is still part of the team's starting lineup and is expected to play alongside Lin Tingqian, Liu Zheng, and Zeng Wendong. The small forward position will be filled by either Li Qiwei or Lu Junxiang, with the \"Black Panther\" Abassi coming off the bench. \"We hope that Abassi can be the best sixth man because he can easily change the game and bring a lot of scoring power to the team,\" Maoson stated. He also mentioned that Abassi will likely be the sixth man, and the final starting lineup will be chosen between Li Qiwei and Lu Junxiang. Currently, they are leaning towards Lu Junxiang as he can help ease Lin Tingqian's workload as a guard and relieve some pressure from him.</p>"},{"location":"20231105091158046850/","title":"\u9019\u9805\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u78ba\u8b93\u4eba\u9707\u9a5a\uff0c\u56e0\u70baHarden\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u7403\u5834\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4e5f\u975e\u5e38\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u5168\u660e\u661f\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u806f\u76df\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u624b\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002","text":"<p>\u5c0d\u65bc\u4e03\u516d\u4eba\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u9019\u7b46\u4ea4\u6613\u610f\u5473\u8457\u4ed6\u5011\u6b63\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u800c\u5c0d\u65bc\u5feb\u8247\u968a\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u88dc\u5f37\u3002Harden\u7684\u5230\u4f86\u5c07\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u5feb\u8247\u968a\u7684\u9032\u653b\u5be6\u529b\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f7f\u4ed6\u5011\u66f4\u6709\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u3002</p> <p>\u9019\u6b21\u4ea4\u6613\u4e5f\u6a19\u8a8c\u8457Harden\u5c07\u8207\u524d\u968a\u53cbKevin Durant\u91cd\u805a\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u66fe\u5728\u96f7\u9706\u968a\u4e00\u8d77\u6253\u7403\uff0c\u73fe\u5728\u53c8\u5c07\u5728\u5feb\u8247\u968a\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u6230\u3002\u9019\u5c0d\u65bc\u5feb\u8247\u968a\u4f86\u8aaa\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u975e\u5e38\u503c\u5f97\u671f\u5f85\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u3002</p> <p>\u96d6\u7136\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u8a73\u7d30\u5167\u5bb9\u9084\u6709\u5f85\u88dc\u5145\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u6b21\u4ea4\u6613\u5df2\u7d93\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u7684\u71b1\u70c8\u8a0e\u8ad6\u3002\u5927\u5bb6\u90fd\u5728\u731c\u6e2c\u9019\u6b21\u4ea4\u6613\u5c0d\u5169\u652f\u7403\u968a\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4e5f\u671f\u5f85\u8457Harden\u5728\u5feb\u8247\u968a\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002</p> <p>\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u62ed\u76ee\u4ee5\u5f85\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u9019\u6b21\u4ea4\u6613\u5c07\u6703\u5e36\u4f86\u600e\u6a23\u7684\u6539\u8b8a\u3002\u9019\u5c0d\u65bcNBA\u7403\u8ff7\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u7d55\u5c0d\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7cbe\u5f69\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u3002   \u9019\u9805\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u78ba\u8b93\u4eba\u9707\u9a5a\uff0c\u56e0\u70baHarden\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u7403\u5834\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4e5f\u975e\u5e38\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u5168\u660e\u661f\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u806f\u76df\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u624b\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002</p> <p>\u5c0d\u65bc\u4e03\u516d\u4eba\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u9019\u7b46\u4ea4\u6613\u610f\u5473\u8457\u4ed6\u5011\u6b63\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u800c\u5c0d\u65bc\u5feb\u8247\u968a\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u88dc\u5f37\u3002Harden\u7684\u5230\u4f86\u5c07\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u5feb\u8247\u968a\u7684\u9032\u653b\u5be6\u529b\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f7f\u4ed6\u5011\u66f4\u6709\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u3002</p> <p>\u9019\u6b21\u4ea4\u6613\u4e5f\u6a19\u8a8c\u8457Harden\u5c07\u8207\u524d\u968a\u53cbKevin Durant\u91cd\u805a\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u66fe\u5728\u96f7\u9706\u968a\u4e00\u8d77\u6253\u7403\uff0c\u73fe\u5728\u53c8\u5c07\u5728\u5feb\u8247\u968a\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u6230\u3002\u9019\u5c0d\u65bc\u5feb\u8247\u968a\u4f86\u8aaa\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u975e\u5e38\u503c\u5f97\u671f\u5f85\u7684\u7d44\u5408\u3002</p> <p>\u96d6\u7136\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u8a73\u7d30\u5167\u5bb9\u9084\u6709\u5f85\u88dc\u5145\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u6b21\u4ea4\u6613\u5df2\u7d93\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u7684\u71b1\u70c8\u8a0e\u8ad6\u3002\u5927\u5bb6\u90fd\u5728\u731c\u6e2c\u9019\u6b21\u4ea4\u6613\u5c0d\u5169\u652f\u7403\u968a\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4e5f\u671f\u5f85\u8457Harden\u5728\u5feb\u8247\u968a\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u3002</p> <p>\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u62ed\u76ee\u4ee5\u5f85\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u9019\u6b21\u4ea4\u6613\u5c07\u6703\u5e36\u4f86\u600e\u6a23\u7684\u6539\u8b8a\u3002\u9019\u5c0d\u65bcNBA\u7403\u8ff7\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u7d55\u5c0d\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u7cbe\u5f69\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231105091202392434/","title":"Behind every jersey, there are many stories","text":"<p>Behind every jersey, there are many stories. In the summer of 2017, Fuming International was officially established and formed a team to participate in the first TGF Fire Cup. Through this tournament, they established a strong bond and over the years, Fuming International has grown stronger and established a place in the southern region. This year, they even won the TGF Fire Cup national championship. Let's listen to their story! (Photos provided by IG: joemystory_photo) Please continue reading</p> <p>In the early days of Fuming International, team leader Song Xiangyue faced many challenges. The team lacked resources and recognition, and the more talented players tended to join established teams. As a result, they often found themselves in a situation where they had no players for the game, and even with enough manpower, they still lacked competitiveness.</p> <p>When selecting players, the biggest principle is responsibility and agreement with Fuming International's team philosophy of \"team first.\" Players with poor emotional management, multiple small actions on the court, or prone to conflicts are not welcome on the team. (Photos provided by IG: joemystory_photo) Please continue reading</p> <p>The players of Fuming International come from all over the country, gathering elite college players from the southern region. Due to their different backgrounds, there may be conflicts in their playing styles. The only solution is to communicate and cooperate patiently, and through time, they gradually come to understand and play well together.</p> <p>\"Life has many things more important than winning or losing. Basketball is just a spice.\" (Photos provided by IG: joemystory_photo) Please continue reading</p> <p>Talking about his experience leading the team, Song Xiangyue said, \"Everyone who joined this team must have agreed with Fuming's principles and philosophy, so communication is relatively easy. They are also willing to listen to me, and compared to things on the court, I care more about their daily lives and their future.\" (Photos provided by IG: joemystory_photo)</p> <p>Fuming International participated in the TGF Fire Cup intercollegiate tournament in 2017 and 2019, winning the national third place in 2019. After three years of intense training in the social group, they now have a strong lineup with experienced players. They returned to the TGF Fire Cup with a new look and were happy to defeat their strongest opponents and achieve the best results. \"We are very fortunate that our core team has remained the same over the years, despite the high turnover rate of grassroots teams. This shows that our players all believe in this big family and are willing to go through difficulties and progress together.\" Team leader Song Xiangyue said. (Photos provided by IG: joemystory_photo)</p> <p>In the process of becoming a better team, Fuming International has many benefactors. Song Xiangyue said, \"I want to thank head coach Tao for always guiding me, my senior player Guanlin who gave me many pointers on and off the court, all the partners behind the scenes, and all the players who have followed and believed in Fuming. Lastly, my family who has always supported me. Without any one of them, none of this would be possible.\"</p> <p>A good team must always strive for excellence and enjoy the joy that basketball brings. For Fuming International, winning the TGF Fire Cup is just a temporary goal. They cannot be satisfied with the current situation but must continue to push themselves to improve. Each role has its own stage, and leaving student basketball does not mean the end of the story. Fuming International was born for this.

The newly joined player of the Kings, Lin Shuhao, made his debut and started the game, attracting a large number of fans to the Keelung City Stadium to witness his amazing basketball skills.</p> <p>The Kings started the game with a 21-7 lead, with Lin Shuhao, Michelle, Li Kaiyan, Su Shixuan, and Chen Junnan in the starting lineup. However, after Lin Shuhao was substituted, the Kings encountered offensive problems and made many turnovers, allowing the Dream Team to score through transition and take an 18-point lead (57-39) in the second quarter.</p> <p>Lin Shuhao played a total of 18 minutes in this game, and his presence on the court had a significant impact, especially in the second quarter when he came in and helped the team catch up. In the third quarter, he scored 13 points in a 13-2 run, tying the game at 61-61. In the fourth quarter, both teams had already substituted their main players, but the game remained intense. Lin Liren's three-pointers brought the crowd to their feet. However, the Kings made more mistakes on the offensive end in the crucial moments, allowing the Dream Team to score repeatedly and pull away with a ten-point lead. In the end, the Dream Team defeated the Kings 101-95, securing their second consecutive win in the pre-season. Lin Shuhao and another foreign player, Billy, both scored a team-high 16 points for the Kings. Lin also had 5 rebounds and 3 assists. Other players for the Kings, such as Chen Junnan and Li Kaiyan, also contributed with 10 points each. For the Dream Team, Brion Rush scored a game-high 25 points, and even though he suffered an injury in the second half, he returned to the court to continue playing. Besanishvili and Makalo also had double-double performances. In the third quarter, Qian Keni hit Manny's elbow and had to leave the court due to a bleeding injury.

This led to the trades of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving to the Suns and Mavericks respectively, and the team underwent a rebuilding process with the assets acquired from these trades.</p> <p>First, Mikal Bridges quickly proved himself as a contender for the Most Improved Player award after joining the team. With similar offensive efficiency as his time with the Suns and being the team's top scorer, he averaged 26.1 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game, becoming a cornerstone for the team during the transition period. Cameron Johnson overcame his initial struggles with the team and showed a more diverse offensive game towards the end of the season. He also proved his ability to play as a supporting role player during the playoffs and earned a four-year contract extension in the summer. Please continue reading to see how the Nets will utilize this wing combination in the new season and how they will repair their team system and culture, which were damaged by the formation of the \"Big Three.\" However, these three players have yet to prove themselves as reliable core players, and with all of them over the age of 27, it is unlikely that they have much untapped potential left.</p> <p>Will the Nets, now stripped of their star power, be able to become the most underestimated team in the league and shake things up? Changes in the roster: Out - Joe Harris, Seth Curry, Patty Mills, Yuta Watanabe, Edmond Sumner, David Duke Jr., Dru Smith, and RaiQuan Gray. Please continue reading to see who will be joining the team: In - Lonnie Walker IV, Dennis Smith Jr., Trendon Watford, Dariq Whitehead, Noah Clowney, Harry Giles III, Jalen Wilson, and Armoni Brooks. Projected roster: PG - Ben Simmons, Dennis Smith Jr., Armoni Brooks SG - Spencer Dinwiddie, Royce O'Neale, Lonnie Walker IV, Cam Thomas SF - Mikal Bridges, Dariq Whitehead, PF - Cameron Johnson, Dorian Finney-Smith, Noah Clowney, Trendon Watford, Jalen Wilson C - Nic Claxton, Day'Ron Sharpe, Harry Giles III (Ben Simmons claimed to be a point guard at media day, so let's continue reading...) Main focus of the season: Rebuilding the team system The main goal of this season is to give the main rotation players from the end of last season, who have had a summer to bond and develop, a chance to reach their potential, as well as to improve the performance of young players who have not lived up to expectations - new classmates Lonnie Walker IV, Dennis Smith Jr., Darius Bazley, Trendon Watford, and Harry Giles III, and Ben Simmons on the team.</p> <p>Here is what head coach Jacque Vaughn has instructed for the offense and defense this season: On the offensive end, Spencer Dinwiddie will play as a shooting guard, with Simmons as the primary ball handler, along with Bridges, who had a breakout season last year, Johnson, who earned a big contract in the summer, and Nic Claxton, who worked on his shooting during the offseason, to create a flexible lineup. Simmons also showed his improvement in free throws and three-point shooting in training videos during the summer. After all, in today's NBA, even if a team has shooters like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, playmaker Draymond Green still has the ability to handle the ball outside.</p> <p>There are two ways to amplify Simmons' offensive threat: first, to develop his ball handling and shooting skills and utilize him in Dribble Handoffs with shooters; second, to play an open-style offense and score quickly before the opponent's defense is set, or to push the ball in transition. Perhaps this is the best instruction manual for the \"project-type\" genius Simmons.</p> <p>Moving on to the defensive end, this is where the team has undergone the most changes. In order to strengthen rebounding and rim protection, the Nets will abandon their previous constant switching defense and replace it with conditional switching.</p> <p>The condition is that when the opponent's ball handler and center run a pick and roll, the Nets will protect the paint, but if it's a double screen or the ball handler is not the center, they will switch.</p> <p>It may sound complicated, so here is the key point - this defense still values individual defense, but also tests the guards' ability to navigate around screens and communicate on the court. This will help solidify rebounding and rim protection, but the downside is that it may leave open shots at the three-point line and mid-range area for the opponent.</p> <p>However, the Nets still have a long way to go in this regard. In the first preseason game against the Lakers, Dinwiddie's weak point was exposed when trying to navigate around screens for D'Angelo Russell, resulting in him hitting four three-pointers and pulling ahead in the score. In the next two games against the 76ers, D'Anthony Melton and Tyrese Maxey also took advantage of Cam Thomas' lack of experience in navigating screens to get open shots through Paul Reed. Although Simmons can pressure the ball handler, his tendency to go for steals also leads to a high number of fouls.</p> <p>Of course, this is only the preseason, and Simmons has just joined the team, so there is still room for improvement. The biggest expectation for this season is to see if the league's biggest forward can bring more wins to the Nets.</p>"},{"location":"20231105091228259400/","title":"\u7e3d\u4e4b\uff0c\u5728\u6797\u79c9\u8056\u52a0\u76df\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\u4e4b\u5f8c\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5404\u65b9\u7684\u61c9\u5c0d\u4e0d\u7576\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u8b93\u53f0\u7063\u8077\u7c43\u8207\u5168\u6c11\u95dc\u6ce8\u5ea6\u9023\u7d50\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u51fa\u73fe\u4e86\u8d85\u904e\u300c\u6797\u79c9\u8056\u300d\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u66f4\u70ba\u71b1\u9580\u7684\u300c\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\u300d\uff0c\u800c\u4ee5\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u60c5\u52e2\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\u4e0d\u50c5\u6c92\u6709\u56e0\u70ba\u6797\u79c9\u8056\u7684\u52a0\u76df\uff0c\u800c\u8b93\u5168\u6c11\u5c0d\u53f0\u7063\u8077\u7c43\u7522\u751f\u66f4\u591a\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u8b93\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\u6210\u70ba\u8077\u7c43\u8a31\u591a\u4eba\u6700\u8a0e\u53ad\u7684\u7403\u968a\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u800c\u50cf\u662f\u9019\u6b21\u7684\u300c\u8a18\u8005\u6703\u300d\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u8b93\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\u5728\u5168\u6c11\u7684\u5fc3\u4e2d\uff0c\u518d\u4e00\u6b21\u5931\u6557\u3002","text":"<p>Sharp weapons cut iron like mud    \u7e3d\u4e4b\uff0c\u5728\u6797\u79c9\u8056\u52a0\u76df\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\u4e4b\u5f8c\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u5404\u65b9\u7684\u61c9\u5c0d\u4e0d\u7576\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u8b93\u53f0\u7063\u8077\u7c43\u8207\u5168\u6c11\u95dc\u6ce8\u5ea6\u9023\u7d50\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u51fa\u73fe\u4e86\u8d85\u904e\u300c\u6797\u79c9\u8056\u300d\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u66f4\u70ba\u71b1\u9580\u7684\u300c\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\u300d\uff0c\u800c\u4ee5\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u60c5\u52e2\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\u4e0d\u50c5\u6c92\u6709\u56e0\u70ba\u6797\u79c9\u8056\u7684\u52a0\u76df\uff0c\u800c\u8b93\u5168\u6c11\u5c0d\u53f0\u7063\u8077\u7c43\u7522\u751f\u66f4\u591a\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u8b93\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\u6210\u70ba\u8077\u7c43\u8a31\u591a\u4eba\u6700\u8a0e\u53ad\u7684\u7403\u968a\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u800c\u50cf\u662f\u9019\u6b21\u7684\u300c\u8a18\u8005\u6703\u300d\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u8b93\u53f0\u65b0\u6230\u795e\u5728\u5168\u6c11\u7684\u5fc3\u4e2d\uff0c\u518d\u4e00\u6b21\u5931\u6557\u3002 </p> <p>Sharp weapons cut iron like mud. The wind is sharp, and Little Iron is like a simulation. I hope to use more discussions to share various opinions on watching games.</p> <p>After the press conference, the 2023 Cross-League Invitational will once again return, this time even larger than last year, with even the UBA three-time champion National Chengchi University stepping onto the battlefield to see if the current undisputed champion of the university basketball world, \"Universal NCCU,\" has the ability to challenge higher levels. This will definitely become a hot topic in the Cross-League Invitational, and as the little brother, NCCU has no pressure - if they lose to a professional team, no one will blame them, but if they win, it might damage the face of the big brother. Additionally, the tournament rules state that no foreign players can be used, but foreign students can be registered. Foreign students are NCCU's basic equipment, and their key player, Mobaye, who is known as the \"strongest foreign student,\" can participate. Everything is advantageous for NCCU. However, challenging a higher level may not be the biggest topic of this tournament. If we consider Taiwan Beer Leopards and the SBL Taiwan Beer as a joint team, the T1 League newcomer Taipei Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors is the purest representation of the T1 League in this tournament. In the previous Cross-League Invitational, the T1 League outperformed P. LEAGUE+ and SBL, with the championship game even being an all T1 League battle between New Taipei City Citibank and Taiwan Beer English Bears. However, before the Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors even made their debut, they had already become the biggest topic, but not for any positive reasons. Please continue reading below. On the roster for the tournament, Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors had written \"Lin Ping-sheng\" in bold letters, just as they had previously claimed, to allow Lin Ping-sheng to represent the Warriors in the tournament. Of course, this tournament does not have Hsinchu JKO Lioneers who participated in the last tournament, which reduces the potential for drama to some extent. However, the trio of Lin Ping-sheng, JKO Lioneers, and Warriors has already been destined to be the unavoidable focus of Taiwanese basketball this offseason.</p> <p>And today, the Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors held a press conference to announce their team roster, cheerleaders, mascot, as well as two foreign players and foreign head coach Brian Adams. However, whether it was the press conference news on social media or the live stream link's comments section, they were all filled with criticism and ridicule, making it very obvious that Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors were not standing on the stage of Taiwanese professional basketball amidst celebratory atmosphere.</p> <p>The \"Warriors\" that cannot calm the storm. Please continue reading below (Image source: Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors) On Monday (September 11th), Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors and Lin Ping-sheng held a press conference, where Lin Ping-sheng read from a script to apologize, talk about recent events, and his decision-making process. However, the biggest issue was that at the end of the press conference, the host said that Lin Ping-sheng and the appointed lawyer would not be interviewed, and that any questions could be directed to the team leader Shang Jui-chiang. However, in the entire press conference, besides emphasizing the opposition between Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors and JKO Lioneers, Shang only revealed that \"the Warriors' offer was not necessarily higher than the Lioneers', but it provided Lin Ping-sheng with more security abroad.\" </p> <p>In terms of a press conference, this is undoubtedly a very poor way to handle things. It is obvious that in this incident where someone signed contracts with two teams, the media would want to ask questions to this individual. Of course, one side's (JKO Lioneers) contract is being questioned and might even be invalid, but the biggest key is on the person who signed with both sides. Unless he can confidently and flawlessly explain his actions and convince all parties, the press conference is where the media would want to ask questions to the person who signed the contracts. Of course, Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors can worry that as a player, Lin Ping-sheng might not have the ability to express himself, but that is why he has an appointed lawyer. Since in the previous coordination meeting, Lin Ping-sheng was able to be represented by his appointed lawyer, today at the press conference where both Lin and his appointed lawyer were present, it is their basic obligation to be interviewed. However, in the end, Lin Ping-sheng left with a confusing statement \"I will take responsibility for what I should,\" while the appointed lawyer only used the phrase \"statute of limitations,\" which has become a legal joke on the internet. Then, both of them refused to be interviewed and only left the team leader Shang Jui-chiang. From his \"chat\" with the media, it is clear that the team leader could not clarify any doubts about Lin Ping-sheng. This means that although since the incident has been revealed, many details about JKO Lioneers' contact with Lin Ping-sheng, contract details, and duration were not perfect and can be attacked, after Monday's press conference, the only thing the public thinks is that Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors handled the situation poorly, resulting in even more negative evaluations. This even extends to the team's social media presence; after Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors' Instagram was made public after the press conference, Lin Ping-sheng, who had left a cold comment when JKO Lioneers officially announced his signing, became very active in commenting on the team's posts. Most notably, when the Warriors released posts introducing their players, Lin Ping-sheng would leave a comment as soon as possible, showing his support and goodwill towards his teammates. However, because of his recent public appearance and improper comments, the Warriors' Instagram has become a \"flaming\" pit. Not only did Lin Ping-sheng receive many negative replies, but even after he stopped commenting, netizens would still leave sarcastic messages under the Warriors' posts. </p> <p>In summary, after Lin Ping-sheng joined Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors, due to all parties' inappropriate responses, the event that links Taiwanese professional basketball with the public has become more about \"Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors\" than \"Lin Ping-sheng.\" And in the current situation, Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors not only did not generate more interest in Taiwanese basketball because of Lin Ping-sheng's joining but also became one of the most disliked teams in the league. For example, this press conference has once again resulted in Taiwan Shin Kong Warriors being seen as a failure in the public's eyes.</p>"},{"location":"20231106091129268220/","title":"\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u514d\u8cac\u5340\u7684\u534a\u5f91\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u4fc3\u4f7f\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u963b\u653b\uff0c\u9019\u5c07\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5c0d\u653b\u5b88\u96d9\u65b9\u90fd\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\u3002","text":"<p>\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u514d\u8cac\u5340\u7684\u534a\u5f91\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u4fc3\u4f7f\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u963b\u653b\uff0c\u9019\u5c07\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u5c0d\u653b\u5b88\u96d9\u65b9\u90fd\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231106091133264413/","title":"\u7e3d\u7684\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u968a\u5728\u9019\u6b21\u4e16\u754c\u76c3\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4e26\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u4e26\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u8457\u4ed6\u5011\u5c07\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u7c43\u7403\u7684\u9738\u4e3b\u3002\u4ed6\u5011\u4ecd\u7136\u64c1\u6709\u6700\u591a\u7684\u5929\u624d\u7403\u54e1\u3001\u6700\u5f37\u7684\u5be6\u529b\u548c\u6700\u591a\u7684\u8cc7\u6e90\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u4ed6\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u9762\u5c0d\u73fe\u5be6\uff0c\u505a\u51fa\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8abf\u6574\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u570b\u969b\u8cfd\u5834\u4e0a\u7a31\u9738\u3002","text":"<p>The Harsh Reality USA Men's Basketball May No Longer be Dominant</p> <p>USA suffered a disappointing 113-111 loss to Germany in the semi-finals of the World Cup, ending their chances of becoming the most talented team in the tournament    \u7e3d\u7684\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u968a\u5728\u9019\u6b21\u4e16\u754c\u76c3\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4e26\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u4e26\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u8457\u4ed6\u5011\u5c07\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u7c43\u7403\u7684\u9738\u4e3b\u3002\u4ed6\u5011\u4ecd\u7136\u64c1\u6709\u6700\u591a\u7684\u5929\u624d\u7403\u54e1\u3001\u6700\u5f37\u7684\u5be6\u529b\u548c\u6700\u591a\u7684\u8cc7\u6e90\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u4ed6\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u9762\u5c0d\u73fe\u5be6\uff0c\u505a\u51fa\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8abf\u6574\uff0c\u4ed6\u5011\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u570b\u969b\u8cfd\u5834\u4e0a\u7a31\u9738\u3002 </p> <p>The Harsh Reality USA Men's Basketball May No Longer be Dominant</p> <p>USA suffered a disappointing 113-111 loss to Germany in the semi-finals of the World Cup, ending their chances of becoming the most talented team in the tournament. However, this is not the end of USA basketball. The outcome of the World Cup for the USA team was expected, as they struggled offensively and lacked energy and awareness on the defensive end.</p> <p>(Daniel Theis' early uncontested dunk showed that the USA team was not prepared to defend against this type of low corner screen.) Please continue reading as USA players were tired from defending against fast breaks and often failed to properly match up on defense. They struggled to stop Germany's ball handlers (such as Dennis Schroder) from driving into the paint.</p> <p>In addition, they gave up on extra passes, turning their offense into a one-on-one matchup (in the final minutes of the game, when Anthony Edwards attempted a mid-range jumper, he passed it to an unsuspecting Jaren Jackson Jr., who was charging towards the paint instead of running to the perimeter as Edwards had intended.) They also committed fouls on Germany's three-point attempts, fell for their pump fakes, and allowed Germany to shoot a high 57.7% from the field. USA's rebounding performance was not terrible (although they were outrebounded by 23 in their previous game against Montenegro!), but there is room for improvement. Theis had a great game, contributing 21 points and 7 rebounds.</p> <p>USA's full-court press was easily broken by their opponents and their half-court defense became predictable and lacked aggression.</p> <p>Austin Reaves struggled in low post defense and became a target for Germany's offense.</p> <p>Mikal Bridges only attempted seven shots. And despite Tyrese Haliburton's strong performance, he still couldn't crack the starting lineup. Photo source: Getty Images</p> <p>Without Brandon Ingram due to upper respiratory issues, Steve Kerr had to manage the minutes of Jalen Brunson and Anthony Edwards as much as possible, but despite these adjustments, they still lost by one point.</p> <p>Please continue reading All of these criticisms are valid, and for those who are disappointed with USA's performance in international competitions and believe that this team needs to reassess themselves, watching this USA team can be quite disheartening.</p> <p>Of course, this team, which is supposed to be the strongest, did not live up to its potential. Some of the lineup decisions were questionable, such as why Brunson, who has been fouling out, was not included in the final five players on the court? Throughout the months of training and competition, this team lacked cohesion.</p> <p>However, this is a flawed, undersized, and less versatile roster, playing under different rules and with new teammates, so this is just a small sample size. Additionally, there is a reason why Germany remained undefeated, including their talented NBA players, size, three-point shooting, and intangible fighting spirit.</p> <p>At the same time, USA sent their (extremely talented) reserve roster. Please continue reading Furthermore, looking at the entire FIBA World Cup, one can also think about how this experience will affect players' performance in the upcoming NBA season. In this World Cup environment, some NBA players were taken out of their usual roles on their teams and had to sacrifice their egos. Will this expand or shrink their roles? It will be interesting to see if their confidence will grow or diminish.</p> <p>Photo source: Getty Images The World Cup reminds us of what a player can accomplish when they stay healthy (such as Bogdan Bogdanovic), gives us a glimpse into a player's journey towards greatness (such as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander), or confirms a player's greatness (such as Daniel Theis).</p> <p>It can be a glimpse into a player's future, whether it is growth or stagnation, or it may not mean anything at all.</p> <p>Ingram's and Jaren Jackson Jr.'s underwhelming performances should not cause concern for the Pelicans or Grizzlies, but these teams may have hoped to see the All-Star caliber performances that they usually see from these players.</p> <p>Aside from Reaves, who was targeted by Germany's offense, they also weren't afraid to attack JJJ from the perimeter. Edwards led USA in scoring and was clearly the best player on the team.</p> <p>He will read the game more decisively in the future and will undoubtedly surpass his performance in this tournament. He can easily become a star player who averages 28 points, seven assists, and five rebounds per game.</p> <p>His defensive performance is also outstanding and should not be overlooked because of his impressive offense, which is one of the most exciting aspects of his game (especially on the defensive end).</p> <p>Overall, USA's performance in this World Cup was not ideal, but it doesn't mean that they will no longer be the dominant force in international basketball. They still have the most talented players, the strongest team, and the most resources. As long as they face reality and make necessary adjustments, they can still dominate on the international stage.</p>"},{"location":"20231106091201925809/","title":"NBA player Grant Williams of the Dallas Mavericks gave an interview where he talked about his interactions with Jayson Tatum's son Deuce in the locker room","text":"<p>NBA player Grant Williams of the Dallas Mavericks gave an interview where he talked about his interactions with Jayson Tatum's son Deuce in the locker room.

is undoubtedly one of the dark horses in this year's World Cup.</p> <p>A few months ago, they were ranked 15th by FIBA and managed to beat several strong teams, including the United States. Even in their own country, no one expected them to achieve such results this year.</p> <p>Now, let's get to know Lithuania, the Eastern European team that has performed exceptionally well in this year's World Cup.</p> <p>Keep reading \"Who's Next?\" This was the reaction of Lithuania's top player Jonas Valanciunas, on the Instagram account of BasketNews, after former assistant coach Kestutis Kemzura resigned a few weeks before the start of the training camp. Valanciunas has not missed any major FIBA international tournament in the past 16 years.</p> <p>Therefore, when another teammate chose not to attend the national team's training camp, he expressed his frustration.</p> <p>Lithuania could have formed a team with all the top players, but players like Domantas Sabonis, Marius Grigonis, Rokas Giedraitis, Edgaras Ulanovas, Arnas Butkevicius, Lukas Lekavicius, and Arturas Gudaitis all declined to represent Lithuania in the World Cup for various reasons.</p> <p>However, the remaining players have become a perfect example that big-name players do not always guarantee the best results, and vice versa. Despite the disappointment of Sabonis, a top Lithuanian player, choosing not to participate in the World Cup, it has relieved head coach Kazys Maksvytis in a way.</p> <p>He no longer has to worry about how to make Valanciunas and Sabonis work together on the court, as no coach has been able to successfully pair these two NBA players in the past, which has been proven in previous international games. Valanciunas became the main threat in the low post, ensuring points in the paint.</p> <p>In the World Cup, he lived up to expectations, averaging 14.5 points (with an impressive 69.2% shooting percentage), 11 rebounds, and 1.5 assists, with a very efficient performance. He was also selected for the second team after the tournament ended. Photo source: Getty Images With many veterans withdrawing from the national team, Rokas Jokubaitis realized that the main ball-handling duties would fall on his shoulders. Keep reading Before the World Cup, the 22-year-old Jokubaitis did not fully live up to the expectations and potential he had been recognized for in recent years. He also struggled in the first game against Egypt, scoring only 2 points and going 0-for-6 from the field, with three turnovers.</p> <p>However, he quickly bounced back like an experienced star. In the next three games against Mexico, Montenegro, and Greece, Jokubaitis averaged 17.7 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 6.3 assists, with an impressive efficiency score of 23.3.</p> <p>In addition, his three-point shooting was also excellent, making 8 out of 7 attempts. Despite being only 22 years old, he was also one of the youngest starting point guards in this tournament, but his teammates admire his ability to control the game and guide the offense. \"When I think back to my performance and decision-making at his age, I can only give him great praise because he was able to effectively handle the high-level challenges he faced. He knew very well that if he didn't perform well, we might have a difficult game ahead.</p> <p>He struggled in his first game, just like last year. But he quickly learned from his mistakes and made progress.\" Mindaugas Kuzminskas said. With Marius Grigonis withdrawing, Ignas Brazdeikis became the only true scorer who can solve problems in crucial moments, especially when Lithuania needs a 1-on-1 solution in the final moments.</p> <p>Teammates noticed that Brazdeikis is not a player who likes to force his way to the basket, but rather reads the situation and is willing to share the ball, unlike last year.</p> <p>The current Brazdeikis is averaging 11.5 points, with a 54.5% shooting percentage from two-point range and an impressive 70% three-point shooting percentage.</p> <p>He also contributes with an average of 4.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game. His turnovers have reduced from 2.2 turnovers per game in the last EuroBasket to just 1.0 in the World Cup, and his shooting percentage has increased by a surprising 20.7%.</p> <p>The other players around this core team have also shown their professional skills, whether it's a defensive ace or a versatile veteran. Their team success always takes precedence over individual aspirations. For example, former New York Knicks player Mindaugas Kuzminskas was hardly included in the rotation in the 2019 World Cup and the 2021 Olympic qualifying games.</p> <p>However, under the guidance of Kazys Maksvytis, he successfully regained his confidence and returned to his normal performance.</p> <p>As a 33-year-old veteran, Kuzminskas has performed well in the World Cup, averaging 10.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 2.5 assists, with an impressive 75% shooting percentage from two-point range and 46.2% from three-point range. He can also make crucial shots in the game's critical moments.</p> <p>Regardless of whether they are young players or experienced veterans, the Lithuanian team has a complete lineup, able to adapt to different game rhythms and styles. Their teamwork is a major factor in their success in the World Cup.</p> <p>However, Lithuania also has some danger factors that may affect their performance in the World Cup. Firstly, their lack of depth in the lineup may become a problem. With players retiring and withdrawing from the national team, Lithuania's lineup has become relatively weak and lacks substitute players who can fill the gaps.</p> <p>Secondly, their team also lacks a true scorer who can make crucial shots in the game's critical moments. Despite the impressive performances of Brazdeikis and Jokubaitis, their experience and abilities are still limited, and they cannot guarantee to shoulder such a heavy responsibility in every game.</p> <p>Finally, Lithuania also needs to address their defensive problems. Their defensive performance in the World Cup is not outstanding, especially in defending the inside. If they cannot improve their defense, their opponents may take advantage of this to gain an advantage.</p> <p>Overall, Lithuania is a very promising team that has performed well in the World Cup, but there are still some danger factors that may affect their performance. They need to maintain teamwork in the game, solve the problems of lineup depth and defense, in order to truly become a dark horse and compete for victory in the World Cup.</p>"},{"location":"20231107092334324988/","title":"\"Jimmy Butler Debuts New Groomed Hairstyle at NBA Media Day with Miami Heat\"","text":"<p>NBA's Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler made an appearance at media day with a new hairstyle, shedding his signature messy braids for a longer, more groomed look </p> <p>NBA's Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler made an appearance at media day with a new hairstyle, shedding his signature messy braids for a longer, more groomed look.</p> <p>As the new season approaches, teams are holding media days to promote their players.

Will he excel under FIBA's rules Observations from his 7 games.","text":"<p>Can the FIBA World Cup annual first team withstand FIBA's rule test? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 7-game World Cup observation</p> <p>As expected, SGA will represent Canada in the FIBA Basketball World Cup during the off-season </p> <p>Can the FIBA World Cup annual first team withstand FIBA's rule test? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 7-game World Cup observation</p> <p>As expected, SGA will represent Canada in the FIBA Basketball World Cup during the off-season. The FIBA format, which has limited space for offense, has made it difficult for many NBA stars to adapt. SGA's main scoring areas are in the mid-range and inside the paint. However, Canada is not like many European teams where players have played together for several years. Their roster is very unstable (the most experienced player, Kelly Olynyk, played in the 2010 World Cup) and their head coach, Jordi Fernandez (an assistant coach for the Kings), is coaching a national team for the first time.</p> <p>Therefore, as a first-timer in the adult national team, SGA is not expected to achieve great results. In the group stage, except for the game against Lebanon where the skill gap was too big, SGA's performance was almost the same in games against France and Latvia. The tight defense from Batum and Latvia's height advantage made it difficult for him to perform well in the beginning of the game. However, SGA showed great adaptability. If the opponents did not use targeted defensive strategies (such as double-teaming or trapping), he could still score efficiently in the second half.</p> <p>In the second round, SGA faced more frequent double-teams. Brazil's tight defense and tall frontcourt, combined with teammates like RJ Barrett and Nickeil Alexander-Walker having poor shooting performances, made it difficult for SGA to find open shots. This resulted in his lowest shooting percentage in the tournament (less than 50%). In the game after the group stage, facing the pressure of \"win or go home,\" SGA had a rare poor performance in the third quarter. However, as the team's leader, he still managed to step up in crucial moments. With less than two minutes left in the game, he made a difficult three-pointer and a mid-range jump shot near the three-point line (he also made all six free throws in the final moments), along with Brooks' amazing performance, helped Canada secure a spot in the quarter-finals and a ticket to the Paris Olympics.</p> <p>In the quarter-finals against Slovenia, it was supposed to be an exciting matchup between the two top stars in the tournament (SGA vs Doncic). However, the game was overshadowed by biased officiating. But in terms of SGA's performance, even if those free throws were not called, his performance was still unquestionably excellent. When Slovenia closed the gap to single digits in the fourth quarter, SGA stepped up with consecutive buckets and an offensive rebound to secure the win. This was the last challenge and weakness he faced in the tournament. Despite the lack of defensive three-second violations, which reduced his frequency of entering the paint, SGA was still able to use early offense and mid-range shots to tear apart the defense. His biggest weakness may be his three-point shooting percentage, which was less than 30% in the tournament.</p> <p>In the semi-finals against Serbia, they fully exploited this weakness. Serbia's strategy was simple - completely deny SGA any shooting space. From the paint to the three-point line, they constantly put pressure on him. The primary defender, Aleksa Avramovic, was a tough matchup for SGA. Even if SGA managed to get past him, there would always be help defense waiting. In addition, they had Nikola Milutinov protecting the paint, which forced SGA to pass the ball throughout the game (only 8 field goal attempts for 15 points).</p> <p>Serbia's rotation and help defense were also very impressive. Even with all the focus on SGA, they did not give other players comfortable shooting opportunities. SGA became frustrated in this extremely passive situation and even lost the ball in the logo area when Avramovic stole it from him. As a result, Canada lost the game.</p> <p>In the bronze medal game against the USA, SGA was once again guarded by Mikal Bridges and Austin Reaves. However, their double-teaming was not as effective as Serbia's. Also, SGA, who has ball handling skills, has improved in his passing decisions after playing as the team's point guard for the entire World Cup. He not only scored 31 points with a high shooting percentage, but also had a career-high of 12 assists (partly due to Dillon Brooks' amazing performance). In overtime, he scored 5 consecutive points to stabilize the team, which ultimately led to Canada's first World Cup medal in history.</p> <p>In summary, SGA's World Cup journey was definitely a success. Despite losing Jamal Murray, the team's star point guard, to injury, SGA, as the team's primary ball handler, led a group of unfamiliar teammates (except for his cousin, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, and Lu Dort) and proved that he is still a top scorer, averaging over 30 points per game. He was selected to the World Cup All-Star Five and unlocked the NBA+FIBA first team in the same year. However, his lack of a reliable outside shot is still an issue. Serbia's tight defense and double-teaming clearly targeted this weakness. If SGA can improve his pull-up jump shot after using a screen or his own dribble, he can punish this type of defense. We believe that he is aware of this and will work on it. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's stats in the World Cup: 24.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, 6.5 assists (only 1.4 turnovers), 1.6 steals, shooting percentages of 54.4%/30.0%/88.7%.</p>"},{"location":"20231107092349413614/","title":"14 is the sharpshooter we can't ignore from the New Taipei City Sinbon Special Forces of Chinese Men's Basketball","text":"<p>14 is the sharpshooter we can't ignore from the New Taipei City Sinbon Special Forces of Chinese Men's Basketball. With excellent positioning and a quick release, Xie Yaxuan has earned his second chance to play for the national team. Despite being plagued by injuries before the Hangzhou Asian Games, he did not participate in any official games with his team, resulting in less playing time in the early stages. However, like a microwave, he always manages to add offensive firepower when needed, despite not being exceptionally tall. His courage and tactical understanding are exactly what the Chinese team needs to fill the void at the shooting guard position.</p> <p>Please continue reading below \u25bc</p> <p>A gamble that paid off, the efficiency of the Special Forces group</p> <p>In order to prepare for the Hangzhou Asian Games, the Chinese Men's Basketball team had to deal with the injuries of their main point guard Chen Yingjun and sharpshooter Xie Yaxuan. The coaching staff took a gamble and kept him on the roster, even though he did not participate in any warm-up games or the Jones Cup to build chemistry with his teammates.</p> <p>Upon arriving at the Asian Games, Xie Yaxuan did not appear on the rotation list. Even against weaker teams in the group stage, he only played for less than 5 minutes and did not have many opportunities to shoot. However, in the game against Mongolia, he was part of the Special Forces group with Abassi and Zeng Wendong, and their great chemistry was evident as he scored 5 points, grabbed 1 rebound, and dished out 2 assists in a short amount of time. This gave the head coach a glimpse of a new shining star.</p> <p>As the Chinese team advanced to the top 12 as the second seed, Xie Yaxuan earned more playing time. In the first game against taller Kazakhstan, he was able to showcase his abilities and not only contribute offensively, but also on defense. This continued in the game against Japan, where he showed his skills as a 3-and-D player.</p> <p>In the semifinal game against Jordan, as the score was pulled apart early on, Xie Yaxuan took on the responsibility of playing both the shooting guard and point guard positions in the second half. He made the most of his hard-earned playing time and challenged the opponents on both ends of the court. He made shots from the outside and was effective in driving to the basket, and after the game, he expressed his gratitude to the coach for trusting him. He finished the game with 11 points, 2 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 steals, living up to expectations. In the bronze medal game against China, in order to free up Chen Yingjun and Abassi to score more, coach Sun Maosen moved Xie Yaxuan to the point guard position, utilizing his good court vision to distribute the ball. Although he had less scoring opportunities, he still contributed 4 assists and proved that he is capable of being part of the rotation and contributing more to the team. However, looking at the performance of the team as a whole, it is evident that the sharpshooters were almost non-existent. Li Qiwei, who had a good performance in the Jones Cup, and Lu Junxiang, who returned to the starting lineup, were unable to produce similar results, making the offensive output of the second unit of the Chinese team lackluster. Without Xie Yaxuan's contributions, it would have been even harder to make it to the semifinals.</p> <p>Please continue reading below \u25bc</p> <p>Having the title of a sharpshooter but lacking the skills, fundamentals are key</p> <p>The current trend in basketball is to play faster and shoot from farther away. In the ever-changing world of Taiwanese basketball, most players have been chasing after high volume shooting since their student days. Many coaches also start with fast-paced tactics like run-and-gun and Pistol. Games where players shoot without hesitation are not uncommon. However, when it comes to professional basketball, there are not as many qualified sharpshooters or 3-and-D players as one might imagine. The key lies in \"lack of accuracy\" and \"poor positioning awareness\", which can be extended to \"lack of tactical understanding\" and \"insufficient defensive skills\". Therefore, in the less intense domestic league, players may have impressive statistics, but in international games where defense is key and every possession matters, players with weak fundamentals are easily exposed. Please continue reading below \u25bc</p> <p>Japan and South Korea, two major basketball powers, have always had precise and impressive sharpshooters, both in the past and present. Even with limited opportunities and off-balance shots, they manage to make them. Not to mention their speed and awareness in cutting to the basket, created by their own movements.</p> <p>Ryan, the head coach of the New Taipei Kings, mentioned in an interview that a shooter should always be ready to shoot. The team designs tactics for you, but you have to create opportunities for yourself by finding open spots and receiving the ball, and then take bold shots. This is what young players entering the professional world need to break through. Why is that? Because in the double-import basketball that emphasizes team play, young players often lack the confidence to take more shots, fearing that a few misses will lead to being taken out of the game, and they end up missing more opportunities and becoming more conservative. Of course, this is a two-way street, and whether the coach is willing to give space for players to do so also has an impact on their decision-making.</p> <p>Therefore, although the double-import basketball is booming in recent years, the development of sharpshooters is not as good as that of student basketball. Players like Jian Youzhe, Zhu Yunhao, Lu Junxiang, and Zhang Gengyu, who shone in college, are now either inconsistent in their performance or not on the rotation list. Aside from high-caliber players like Li Qiwei and Huang Conghan, there are only Yu Huanya and Xie Yaxuan who meet the above conditions. It can be said that there are many potential players, but it is still far from possible for them to become part of the first-team squad. This also affects the formation of the team, as a lack of space means that it is harder to utilize the cutting and low-post skills of the forwards and centers. It is not easy for the Chinese team, who likes to play a fast-paced game, to overcome this challenge.</p>"},{"location":"20231107092407388094/","title":"During the NBA media day, Jimmy Butler's new long hairstyle caused quite a stir in the league","text":"<p>During the NBA media day, Jimmy Butler's new long hairstyle caused quite a stir in the league.

In this year's Jones Cup, in addition to naturalized player Arto Tucker becoming the mainstay of the frontcourt, there are also 6 local players waiting on the sidelines.

The three main local players only contributed 7.9 rebounds per game, and their advantage over opponents was not significant. This does not mean that the team has a strong frontcourt. In fact, with the absence of backcourt players, the organization of the offense has become a major problem, which also affects the selection of frontcourt players. This will be a challenge that the team will face in the Asian Games. Li De-Wei was a regular starter in the first few games, as an inside player who can handle the ball, he helped relieve the pressure on Lin Ting-Qian, who was filling in as the point guard, by using a lot of high post and arc top ball handling techniques, as well as hand offs and screen-and-rolls, making \"Chicago Action\" the main tactic and highlighting his strengths among this group of frontcourt players.</p> <p>As shown in the table above, his assist numbers were not bad against the Philippines and Japan, and he also contributed well in rebounds, with a decent plus-minus value. Although he lacks agility, his height and physical strength make him a solid defender in the paint, as evidenced by his average of 1.4 blocks per game. However, his highest scoring record was only 5 points, which shows that he was limited in his performance and was eventually moved to the bench. The crucial point was in the game against Qatar, where Lin Ting-Qian and Arto Tucker's pick and roll partnership allowed coach Stephon Marbury to find a new way to change the high post possession, trying to get the power forward more involved in the attack and adding more options.</p> <p>Although Li De-Wei can shoot from the outside, his release is not fast enough. He can also back down in the low post, but lacks the skills and agility to get past his opponents. His efficiency in following up on rebounds is also not good, and his role is mainly to receive passes and grab offensive rebounds. In the later games, his plus-minus value dropped, proving that his effectiveness on the court was decreasing and his role was becoming unclear.</p> <p>Please continue reading The little episode of this year's Jones Cup was when Zeng Xiang-Jun posted on his personal social media account, expressing his dissatisfaction with his lack of playing time. Although he didn't have many opportunities to play in the first few games, his stats were not bad and he was able to fulfill his role efficiently. His numbers were almost the same as his average, proving his consistency.</p> <p>As everything changed as mentioned earlier, with Lin Ting-Qian leading the offense, there was an increased need for the power forward to be more involved in the attack. Zeng Xiang-Jun, with his quick outside shot, agility, and attacking ability, became the preferred option in the lineup. He made 2 three-pointers against the United Arab Emirates and the United States, and scored in double digits in the last 4 games. In the game against South Korea, he had a plus-minus value of 33, which opened up the space for half-court offense and increased the team's ability to run fast breaks, providing more offensive options for the Chinese team.</p> <p>\"Agility\" is Zeng Xiang-Jun's advantage as a local power forward. With a balanced build of 205 cm and 95 kg, he is capable of playing the 5 out formation and the 1 big 4 small formation. He has a good sense of following up and has a mid-range offensive game, which makes him more suitable for modern basketball trends in both offense and defense. If the coaching staff remains unchanged in the short term, regardless of who becomes the head coach, Zeng Xiang-Jun will still be the first choice in the lineup. However, with only an average of 0.9 assists and 0.7 blocks per game, it is clear that he is mainly responsible for finishing the offense. Even though he is tall enough, his court reading and passing skills need improvement. Apart from handoffs and cross-court passes (for fast breaks), he can't really connect well with the center and power forward, which is the main reason why his effectiveness is limited when playing with Arto Tucker. In addition, he still needs to work on his awareness and instincts in pick and rolls, in order for the coach to have more options to use him.</p> <p>Please continue reading In this open-ended question, who will get playing time in the Asian Games? As mentioned above, the two main local power forwards, Zeng Xiang-Jun and Li De-Wei, have completely different styles of play. One is a defensive and organizing player, while the other excels in offense and speed, bringing different dynamics to the Chinese team. In the Jones Cup, the playing time of these two players has been interchanging, not because of their poor performance, but because of the emphasis on tactics and ball handling. However, it is certain that both of them will be key players in the lineup, playing alongside naturalized players. Under normal circumstances, with the presence of the top three CBA players and quality local point guards, it is clear who will be the starters and substitutes. However, with the changes in the roster due to injuries, this question has become both open-ended and unpredictable. After Chen Ying-Jun confirmed his withdrawal from the Asian Games, Wu Yong-Sheng was added as a substitute. However, the reality of having no point guard is clear. Lin Ting-Qian is still filling in as the point guard, while Zeng Wen-Ding's re-selection makes the selection of local power forwards a no-brainer. It is safe to say that, apart from Zeng Xiang-Jun, the other power forwards may not have many opportunities to play. Even though Zeng Wen-Ding is already 39 years old, his efficient playing style, court reading, and ball handling skills make him a valuable asset for \"winning games\". Unless other players in different positions are performing very well, he will definitely get around 20 minutes of playing time. As for the changes in the roster, the author is disappointed. Winning medals may be important, but sacrificing the future is not worth it.</p>"},{"location":"20231107092443395738/","title":"Cross-League Invitational Tournament Night, Lin Ping-Sheng was taken to the riverbank by Cao Xun-Xiang to shoot","text":"<p>Cross-League Invitational Tournament Night, Lin Ping-Sheng was taken to the riverbank by Cao Xun-Xiang to shoot.

Lin Ping-Sheng smiled and said, \"I feel like I'm not good enough, so I need to train more and learn more.\" The Dream Team Training Team member of the Flying Monkeys, Dongfang Yiyi, was Lin Ping-Sheng's former teammate, and he coincidentally mentioned that during their time at Shin Kong, they often trained independently and went to the riverbank to practice shooting, which was in line with Cao Xun-Xiang's statement.

They advanced to the national competition as the champions of the southern region and ultimately finished as the national runners-up. This achievement will undoubtedly make Tungsheng Freezer even stronger. After three years, Tungsheng Freezer has made significant progress in team and playing strength. Let's hear their story! Please continue reading.</p> <p>Tungsheng Freezer was founded by team leader Chen Weihao in 2019. Chen Weihao admitted that the team's establishment went smoothly in the beginning. At that time, Tungsheng Freezer only competed in the high school division, and in terms of high school basketball, they were almost unbeatable with very few losses. However, the real challenge was stepping out of their comfort zone and entering the social division. The level of competition in the social division was much higher than the high school division, and it was not easy to establish a new team with only a group of talented high school students. In the beginning, they encountered many obstacles, but after two or three years of university experience, the players' physical abilities improved significantly, and they were able to adapt to high-intensity games, gradually reaching their peak performance.</p> <p>When recruiting players, Tungsheng Freezer prioritizes character over basketball skills. Players not only represent themselves but also the team. In recent years, team leader Chen Weihao actively recruited players to join the Tungsheng Freezer family. As the veteran players graduated from high school and went their separate ways, it was necessary to search for new talents in the southern high school region to add new blood and strengthen the team's competitiveness.</p> <p>Leading a team requires not only leading people but also leading their hearts. To cultivate a player in the long run, it is essential to consider this aspect. Chen Weihao said, \"Most of our players have been with me for three or four years since high school. We also have new blood joining us. I often chat with the players, and we often gather together to practice off the court. I give them a stage to perform, and when the team achieves good results, we are not hesitant to reward the players. This allows the players to have confidence in themselves and the team on and off the court. Everyone is proud to be a part of Tungsheng Freezer.\"</p> <p>\"My competitive spirit is strong, and I want to lead the team to win as a team. I don't want to recruit mercenaries for one or two tournaments and then disband. Because we all have the same dream and goal, we prepare for every game to win and make all Tungsheng members confident in our team brand.\"</p> <p>Recalling the Continuation Cup three years ago, Tungsheng Freezer's Huang Shaobo first sealed the championship for the southern region by scoring a buzzer-beater against Fuxiang Township. Then, in the national competition, Lin Yusheng made another fast break to beat CHH and win the national championship. When Tungsheng Freezer returned this year, all the crazy memories of that year came rushing back, and I believe this memory will always remain in the players' hearts.</p> <p>Tungsheng Freezer returned to their home, the Continuation Cup, this year. Chen Weihao said, \"I am truly touched. It's such a familiar feeling, and all the memories of the Continuation Cup come flooding back. Even though we are no longer high school students, the games in the university senior division are still full of passion. The Continuation Cup is an important stage for players.\"</p> <p>This year, Tungsheng Freezer defeated their fierce rival Fuming International in the southern region championship game. However, in the national championship game, the two teams met again, but this time, Tungsheng Freezer did not come out victorious. But as the saying goes, \"when we win, it doesn't mean everything is right; on the contrary, when we lose, it doesn't mean everything is wrong. In fact, sometimes failure is also a kind of victory.\" Chen Weihao also said, \"I don't feel ashamed of this defeat. It will only make us stronger, and next time we meet in the same place, it won't be as easy.\"</p> <p>On the road to realizing his dream, Chen Weihao is most grateful to his father. When he wanted to establish a team, his father and a few good friends supported him without hesitation, allowing him to move forward without any worries and hoping that the players can develop their basketball skills and soar high. Finally, Chen Weihao would like to say to all the players of Tungsheng Freezer, \"Thank you all for your hard work in the Continuation Cup! Remember the lessons from the national championship game, and we will get our revenge in the future. I am very grateful for your participation and for representing Tungsheng in the games. I am sincerely proud of all of you, and I want to win more than anyone else, but as players, there are some things we cannot resist on the court. All we can do is fight back with our goals and win the game to prove ourselves. I hope everyone enjoys the atmosphere of playing basketball and the glory of being a member of Tungsheng. Let's not miss out next year and take back our championship!\"</p>"},{"location":"20231108091249241865/","title":"The Charlotte Hornets' Floor and Ceiling for the New Season","text":"<p>The Charlotte Hornets had a rough season in 2022-23, but looking at the bright side, they may just be temporarily at the bottom of the league    The Charlotte Hornets' Floor and Ceiling for the New Season</p> <p>The Charlotte Hornets had a rough season in 2022-23, but looking at the bright side, they may just be temporarily at the bottom of the league. After all, just two years ago they were a 43-win team and with a healthier roster and fewer off-court distractions, they have the potential to return to that level. LaMelo Ball, who only played 36 games due to ankle injuries last season, should be fully recovered, and Miles Bridges, who missed the entire year due to a domestic violence incident, has re-signed with the team after accepting a qualifying offer. With the addition of Brandon Miller, the second overall pick in this year's draft, the Hornets' roster is almost identical to two years ago.</p> <p>Health is always a concern for every team, and for the Hornets, it has been an even bigger issue when it comes to their young guards. However, the focus of this article is on the non-health factors and X-factor players that will play a crucial role in the team's success this season. The Hornets' goal is to return to the top of the Eastern Conference standings, which is a big leap from last year, but their overall talent has improved even without major offseason acquisitions. Let's continue reading to explore the biggest question: What can rookie Brandon Miller contribute? As the second overall pick, he will surely garner a lot of attention, especially considering he was drafted ahead of Scoot Henderson, who is expected to be a key player for the Portland Trail Blazers. Miller won't have the same role as Henderson, so how he adapts to the role given to him by the Hornets will be crucial for the team's success in the regular season.</p> <p>The Hornets' wing rotation may be a bit chaotic, especially after Miles Bridges returns from his 10-game suspension (though his recent violation of a protection order may affect his eligibility). How Miller handles the unstable playing time and adjusts to a lesser role will be a major challenge in his first year in the NBA. However, Miller's offensive abilities are highly appealing, and there's a reason why the Hornets selected him with the second pick. They can utilize his shooting skills and combine them with LaMelo Ball's creativity. If everything goes well, this Hornets team should be better than last year.</p> <p>However, very few rookies have a smooth season, especially when they're still trying to adapt to a new role. If Miller can't find his own way, it will be interesting to see how head coach Steve Clifford handles the situation. The team wants to be competitive, but sometimes letting a rookie learn from mistakes can go against that goal.</p> <p>Photo source: Getty Images</p> <p>X-Factor: Mark Williams</p> <p>The Hornets have been searching for a suitable center for years, drafting one big man after another in the first round, but never finding the right fit. However, Mark Williams may finally change that.</p> <p>Williams had a strong finish to the last season and was even a starter in the second half of the year after the Hornets traded away Mason Plumlee. Clifford favors Williams' defensive contributions, as his teams are known for their strong interior defense.</p> <p>The Hornets don't have many elite defenders on their roster, making Williams' ability to protect the paint especially valuable. Williams may not be a huge offensive threat, but if he can team up with Ball and Terry Rozier in pick-and-roll situations, his presence could open up opportunities for their outside shooters and relieve some of the offensive burden on Williams.</p> <p>His continued development will be crucial for the Hornets to achieve their goal this season, as they urgently need a stable and versatile center to execute Clifford's defensive strategy. P.J. Washington has played both power forward and center in the past, but he played almost no role in the center rotation under Clifford last year, which is not surprising given his lack of size for the position and his subpar rim protection skills.</p> <p>However, this also means that young centers like Williams and Nick Richards will have enough opportunities to step up and prove themselves, and the team will heavily rely on their performances at the center position. It's both pressure and opportunity for these young players.</p> <p>[Special editor: Lin Yi / Managing editor: Xavier Hsieh]</p> <p>Translated from: The Charlotte Hornets' Biggest Question and X-Factor for the 2023-24 Season</p> <p>\ud83d\udd25 For more latest and greatest NBA features: - New Season Team Questions: Who Will Be the X-Factor for the Nuggets to Repeat as Champions?

After all, the criteria for being a leader is being recognized by others, not just one's own ideas. Of course, Dennis Schroder is undoubtedly the most important player. Without his outstanding performance in the last World Cup, Germany would not have won the bronze medal. Perhaps it has never been a problem on the court, but when an important player in the lineup decides not to help the national team because of the \"leader's\" public statements, it becomes a big problem.</p> <p>Photo source: Getty Images Regardless, Schroder is here and Kleber is not, which is the perfect time to end this story.</p> <p>Last season, Schroder played 66 games for the Los Angeles Lakers. There, he averaged 12.6 points and 4.5 assists per game.</p> <p>In addition, the Wagner brothers have proven themselves to be reliable in the past. Last year, Schroder and Franz Wagner were bronze medalists in the Euro Cup. Moritz Wagner was unable to participate due to injury, but he had a great performance at the Olympics two years ago. Johannes Thiemann and Johannes Voigtmann, as two experienced European league players, cannot be ignored, and Isaac Bonga can defend all positions, from point guard to center.</p> <p>All three of them can threaten opponents from the outside. If you add Daniel Theis' size and abilities inside, it won't be easy for opponents to gain an advantage against Germany.</p> <p>Maodo Lo will be the backup plan for Schroder in the backcourt, and he has proven this through his scoring ability. However, the most anticipated C&amp;S player is Andreas Obst.</p> <p>Although he missed most of last season due to injury, Obst is now healthy and ready to provide his greatest weapon for the national team, which is his three-point shooting.</p> <p>In this regard, he is undoubtedly one of the best players in the European league. Head coach Gordon Herbert The head coach of the German national team is Gordon Herbert, a Canadian. He has led multiple professional teams in his career, and even coached in Frankfurt for three terms.</p> <p>He led them to win the German League championship in 2004 and won the Coach of the Year award for the same team in 2016. In addition, Frankfurt also won the FIBA Europe Cup that season.</p> <p>He has also worked with the Canadian coaching staff and was an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors, and even coached the men's national basketball team of Georgia.

However, in his rookie season, the team did not seem to be grooming him as expected in the draft report. Despite winning the Rookie of the Year award with averages of 15.3 points, 7.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.1 steals per game, Barnes did not take on the organizing responsibilities like Simmons did. However, this also benefited his overall performance, with a true shooting percentage of 55.2%, a free throw percentage of 73.5%, and 58 made three-pointers (Simmons has only made five in his entire career).</p> <p>Most importantly, Barnes showed no fear and overcame limitations with joy and passion. Photo source: Getty Images One year later, things feel a little different. Barnes' organizing ability has slightly improved in his second season, with an average of 4.8 assists per game, but his field goal and three-point percentages have declined.</p> <p>His jump shot seems to be a big problem for the Raptors, and without a stronger offensive advantage, he cannot showcase his organizing ability through his own threat.</p> <p>Please continue reading. In his first two seasons, Barnes attempted 417 three-pointers, with a shooting percentage of 29.0%. Last season, his two-point shooting percentage dropped significantly, from 38.7% to 32.9%.</p> <p>Among the 75 players who attempted at least 200 shots last season, his effective field goal percentage on all pull-up jumpers was only 34.5%.</p> <p>Due to the decrease in offensive efficiency, opponents started to change their strategies. As the season progressed, we saw opponents giving Barnes a lot of space at the top of the arc, cutting off all passing lanes. At this point, Barnes' only offensive options were to shoot directly or drive into the crowded paint with the ball.</p> <p>Based on this, any jump shot choice by Barnes is almost a defensive victory. The only effective countermeasure he has tried is to slightly move the ball to the side, then back down on the defender, giving up space and using post moves to score. This is a good way to score, but his efficiency in scoring with post moves is similar to that of mid-range jumpers.</p> <p>Please continue reading. Poor shooting efficiency is the problem that Barnes must face and the difference between his current state and potential ceiling.</p> <p>Barnes currently does not have excellent shooting ability, but he is willing to shoot from different positions and use that to test the defense, which is obviously beneficial. We all know how opponents look at and limit Ben Simmons after he lost his desire to shoot. Therefore, even if Scottie Barnes' shooting efficiency does not improve, he still has a certain level of restraint and can punish opponents when he is hot. Barnes' physique, agility, ball handling ability, and vision are all very unique.</p> <p>He is a disruptive defender, but is still exploring on the offensive end. He doesn't need to become a shooter like Kevin Durant, but even if he is just a slightly above-average scorer in the league, he can still become an All-Star player and an essential part of the Raptors' rebuilding process.</p> <p>Training shooting is not the only way. Giannis Antetokounmpo overcame similar problems by relying on his physical advantages and increasing his strength to overpower opponents. In theory, this method can also work for Barnes - become a great finisher and frequently attack the basket, using his physical condition to force opponents to change their defensive strategies.</p> <p>However, the Raptors see something in Barnes. If he can improve his shooting, he will have more offensive options. The Step Back ranks Scottie Barnes as the 15th best player under 25 years old in the 2023-24 season.</p> <p>Barnes can still become one of the best players in the league. However, he needs to readjust and make progress this year, otherwise he runs the risk of stagnation.

However, in the game against Lithuania, he struggled against the double team and had to rely on free throws to contribute to his team's score. Despite his efforts, the team's outside shooting was not as effective, and they ultimately lost by 20 points.

They were able to keep up with the USA in the first half, but the US team's young guard Tyrese Haliburton took control of the game in the second half, securing a double-digit lead for his team. Although they lost, Vooch's 18 points and 16 rebounds were impressive, and the USA team had to work hard for their victory. In their final game against Greece, Vooch once again had a strong performance, scoring crucial points in the fourth quarter to secure the win for his team.</p> <p>Overall, it is safe to say that without Vooch's dominant presence in the paint, Montenegro may have only won 1-2 games.

Last season, the New York Knicks achieved a new level of success, making it to the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs for the first time since the 2012-13 season. Their performance has been well recognized and they have even been compared to a strong team. The biggest key to their success was their new leader, Jalen Brunson. Not only did he prove himself as a team leader, but also showed that leaving the Dallas Mavericks was the right decision and helped to bring the Knicks back together.</p> <p>After three seasons, head coach Tom Thibodeau finally revamped the Knicks and found the formula for success.</p> <p>Looking at the Knicks' moves this summer, they were not bad as they were able to retain most of their key players and also added some valuable bench players. The team's tactics for the upcoming season will surely be clearer than last season, but the question is how high can they elevate their game? This will be the biggest challenge for the Knicks in the new season.</p> <p>Please continue reading below for changes in the roster and new additions.</p> <p>Donte DiVincenzo SG (Golden State Warriors)</p> <p>Ryan Arcidiacono PG (Portland Trail Blazers)</p> <p>Charlie Brown Jr. SG (Philadelphia 76ers)</p> <p>Departed players:</p> <p>Obi Toppin PF (Indiana Pacers)</p> <p>Derrick Rose PG (Memphis Grizzlies)</p> <p>The main team from last season is back and there were only minor adjustments made. The most significant additions were former college teammates of Brunson and Josh Hart, Donte DiVincenzo and point guard Ryan Arcidiacono.</p> <p>Arcidiacono will fill in the role of backup point guard after the departure of Derrick Rose, while DiVincenzo brings both offense and defense to the team with his solid fundamentals. He has also been coming off the bench in the past few years to help his team, and with most of the core players still on the team, it shouldn't take long for him to fit in.</p> <p>As head coach Tom Thibodeau said, \"It's very valuable to accumulate experience with each teammate because you've been through a lot together and learned together. How we move forward as a team, one of the biggest advantages is that you already understand your teammates and know how the system works.\" The double core of Brunson and Randle will be the target of opposing teams' defense in the new season.</p> <p>Last season, Brunson was the driving force for the Knicks' offense, averaging 24 points, 3.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 0.9 steals, with shooting percentages of 49.1%, 41.6%, and 82.9% for field goals, three-pointers, and free throws, respectively. He also elevated his game in the playoffs, averaging 27.8 points, 4.9 rebounds, 5.6 assists, and 1.5 steals. He is undoubtedly the Knicks' team leader and the point guard they have been searching for.</p> <p>Although Brunson's defense has been criticized, his determination, drive, and leadership make up for it.</p> <p>\"I think my efficiency will be better in the new season,\" said Julius Randle, who just had ankle surgery in June. \"I understand the game more, which allows me to be a more efficient player.\" Last season, Randle made changes to his game by shooting more three-pointers and reducing long-range two-pointers, resulting in improved shooting efficiency - 8.3 attempts and 34.3% for three-pointers, and 45.9% for overall field goals with an effective field goal percentage of 53.6%.</p> <p>In the new season, it is expected that Randle will continue with the same strategy and, with Brunson leading the offense, help to share the scoring load and target the opponent's weaknesses. Rebounds are crucial in determining the outcome of the game, and this is especially true for the Knicks and Mitchell Robinson. Last season, the Knicks were a threat in terms of rebound protection and offensive rebounds. The main contributor to their offensive rebound rate was Robinson.</p> <p>Although Robinson's presence in the paint may lead to opponents focusing more on defending the Knicks' offense, his dominance in offensive rebounding will continue to be a problem for the opposing team's tall towers. The fate of RJ Barrett, who had a contract extension of $120 million for four years, has been sealed as the cornerstone of the Knicks for the next few years, living up to his title of \"savior\" since being selected in the draft.</p> <p>Barrett averaged 19.6 points, 5 rebounds, 2.8 assists, and 0.4 steals last season with shooting percentages of 43.4%, 31%, and 74% for field goals, three-pointers, and free throws, respectively.</p> <p>Although his performance was not as impressive as the previous season, considering that he now has to share the ball with Brunson, his numbers were still commendable.</p> <p>Barrett's core value lies in his physical abilities and offensive versatility. Although there is still room for improvement, his potential and expectations for the future make him an exciting player to watch. With this roster, the Knicks have a bright future ahead of them, but the most important thing is to maintain their attitude and always be ready to face challenges.</p>"},{"location":"20231109091146442612/","title":"University team wins SBL champion in the first appearance of the Cross-League Basketball Invitational","text":"<p>The Cross-League Basketball Invitational, organized by the Chinese Basketball Association, invited university teams to participate for the first time    University team wins SBL champion in the first appearance of the Cross-League Basketball Invitational </p> <p>The Cross-League Basketball Invitational, organized by the Chinese Basketball Association, invited university teams to participate for the first time. In March of this year, the political powerhouse of the UBA Open Men's Division, which had won three consecutive championships, made its debut and defeated the SBL former champion Taiwan Bank by 21 points after three quarters. In the end, with the all-around performance of their star point guard, You Aizhe, who scored 20 points, had 9 assists and 8 rebounds, the political powerhouse won the game with a score of 87:76.</p> <p>This is the second year of the Cross-League Basketball Invitational, which was first held last year. This year's participating teams include SBL's Taiwan Bank, Taiwan Beer, and Changhua Bank, PLG's Dreamers Youth Team and the Lead Monkey Alliance, and T1 League's new team, Taipei Taishin Warriors. Political powerhouse became the first university team to receive an invitation.</p> <p>Although it was a \"challenge against stronger opponents\", the political powerhouse, which had traveled to the United States, Beijing, Japan, and the Philippines, took the lead with 8 points led by You Aizhe in their first game.

In terms of physicality and individual skills, they were clearly no match for the Chinese Taipei players. It was expected that Chinese Taipei would easily win the game, with a 20-point lead considered a failure. However, they had to fight till the last second against Mongolia and barely secured a victory with their opponent missing a shot.</p> <p>Against Mongolia's smaller size, Chinese Taipei immediately attacked the inside and successfully scored with Atieno's low post attacks. They also used cut and pass tactics to break through Mongolia's defense and took advantage of their taller players to score after drawing double teams. Substitute Abassi also showed his skills as a foreign player with his cutting and finishing ability, leaving Mongolia unable to keep up with his speed and changes of direction.</p> <p>As long as there were no major issues, it should not have been a problem for Chinese Taipei to score against Mongolia's defense. Source: Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee</p> <p>However, as comfortable as their offense was, their defense was equally terrible. Mongolia effectively used Atieno's lateral movement and Chinese Taipei's weakness in their twin tower system, creating opportunities for outside shooting and quick layups. But this cannot be used as an excuse for Chinese Taipei's poor defense.</p> <p>Was it the coaching staff's failure to set up a proper defensive plan before the game? Or was Chinese Taipei's defense simply that bad? Should they switch to front or backcourt defense? Should their tall players retreat or change to man-to-man defense? The players seemed confused about which defensive strategy to execute, resulting in a complete breakdown of their team defense.</p> <p>When the opponent used a four-small-one-big lineup, Chinese Taipei's power forward failed to provide any countermeasures despite having a physical advantage.</p> <p>Lin Ting-chien, who had been performing well in the previous two games, had a rare off night in terms of his shooting. In my opinion, he had more opportunities in the previous games due to being involved in pick-and-rolls, which allowed him to find his rhythm. However, in this game, with Atieno dominating the low post, it was harder for him to find his position. This led to fewer shot attempts in the early stages and affected his focus on defense.</p> <p>Regardless of their individual or team performance, it is crucial for Lin Ting-chien to learn how to control the pace of the game, contribute on both ends of the court, and make plays for his teammates. Source: Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee</p> <p>It wasn't until the second half that Chinese Taipei finally found their rhythm on defense, with Liu Zhen and Abassi's aggressive pressure and steals creating pressure for Mongolia. Combined with the opponent's exhaustion in the fourth quarter, Chinese Taipei was able to come back and win. They definitely have the capability to play high-pressure defense, but it requires all players to actively participate in rotation and communication. Liu Zhen and Abassi's individual efforts were in vain, as it wasn't until the fourth quarter that the team finally played the defense they should have from the beginning. This is not the mindset of a team aiming for the best results at the Asian Games.</p> <p>Chinese Taipei's performance in this game could only be described as a failure. Their defensive rotation and communication were lacking, players' offensive positioning was unclear, and it's hard to believe that they had a three-month training camp with the goal of achieving the best result at the Asian Games. After their loss to China in the previous game, I had hoped that Chinese Taipei would take their weaknesses seriously and improve, but unfortunately, their defense only got worse. Whether it's the basketball association, coaching staff, or players, they all need to reflect on their performance.</p>"},{"location":"20231109091204566268/","title":"NBA Magic Three Players Injured: WCJ Fractures Metacarpal Bone in Left Middle Finger, Fultz Experiences Soreness in Left Knee, Harris Pulls Groin","text":"<p>Wendell Carter Jr   NBA Magic Three Players Injured: WCJ Fractures Metacarpal Bone in Left Middle Finger, Fultz Experiences Soreness in Left Knee, Harris Pulls Groin</p> <p>Wendell Carter Jr. Photo/Reuters</p> <p>On their last stop of the road trip, the Orlando Magic faced off against the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City.

Li Yunxiang, the secretary-general of the Chinese Basketball Association, explained today that there are 3 spots available in the East Asian region this year.

This year, the East Asian region was allocated \"2+1\" spots.</p> <p>Li Yunxiang, the secretary-general of the Chinese Basketball Association, said that they did not receive any information about the tournament this year and after inquiring with other participating countries and sending a letter to the Asian Basketball Confederation, they were told that the qualifications for each region were determined by the respective regional basketball associations. However, the East Asian region, without a meeting with other member countries, decided to use rankings instead of qualifying games to determine the qualifications. As a result, our country, ranked after China, Japan, and South Korea in the East Asian region, was unable to participate. Li Yunxiang emphasized that the decision made by the East Asian Basketball Association was not known to other member countries, including Hong Kong and Macau. South Korea and Japan only found out that our country was not on the list of participating countries during the U16 video conference. The association has sent a letter of protest and requested for the meeting records. Hu Shufen, who also serves as the secretary-general of the Macau Basketball Association, personally apologized, but it is too late to change the fact that our country cannot participate this year. The coaching staff and some members of our U16 representative team went to Ulaanbaatar to participate in the East Asian Youth Games and won the silver medal. In order to avoid affecting the players' morale, the association only informed them of the possibility of not being able to participate after the end of the competition and suggested finding other tournaments for the U16 team to continue training.

Furthermore, Coach Qiu has been quietly helping underprivileged children, embodying the true meaning of education without class distinctions. \"The needs of grassroots basketball can be divided into hardware and software. Hardware includes venues, training environment, and funding sources, which can create urban-rural disparities. It is important for coaches promoting grassroots basketball to bridge this gap.</p> <p>In terms of software, it is important to have consistent and connected teaching materials and content. A complete connection and continuation from beginners to professionals can have a positive impact.\"</p> <p>We can all see Japan's progress in the past decade. Coach Qiu believes that as another East Asian country, if Japan can do it, then Taiwan can do even better.

As long as we are willing to persevere and work hard, we will eventually be seen by more people and even spread and inspire more people to join in grassroots nurturing.\"</p> <p>Coach Qiu humbly expresses his gratitude and humility, stating that he is just one representative among countless others who are committed to grassroots basketball. He hopes to encourage and share with more people who are also dedicated to promoting grassroots basketball, and grow and thrive together.</p> <p>Grassroots education is a never-ending journey with no clear destination, but we can feel the beauty of the scattered changes along the way.</p>"},{"location":"20231110091146756561/","title":"Former Goyang Sono Skygunners player, Anthony Bennet, who had previously joined the Korean Basketball League (KBL) as a former NBA top pick for the Fubon Braves, has been released by the team","text":"<p>Former Goyang Sono Skygunners player, Anthony Bennet, who had previously joined the Korean Basketball League (KBL) as a former NBA top pick for the Fubon Braves, has been released by the team.

I hope that our junior teammates can become more united, work harder, and take every practice and game seriously. With confidence, a team will naturally become stronger. I hope they can achieve even better results in the future.\" Continue reading for more on Lin Ping-yi, who had an outstanding performance this year, averaging double-digit points and being selected in the top five players. In the national group stage game against Nan Da High School, he remained quiet for three quarters before hitting the crucial three-pointer in the final moments to help the team advance to the top four with a first-place finish in their group.</p> <p>Regarding the senior three lineup this year, he said, \"When Little Shih (Shih Hsuan-chung) was not shooting well, I had more opportunities with the ball and was able to make the most of every possession. After advancing to the national competition, our manpower was slightly lacking, and with some players graduating and not continuing to play basketball, our energy was depleted, making the group stage games more challenging. But I am still happy that we were able to finish fourth place.\"</p> <p>Shih Hsuan-chung, who has participated in four TGF Cups, would like to express his gratitude to the TGF staff, saying, \"Thank you to all the staff for the past four years, for providing us with such a great environment to achieve our dreams. The TGF Cup gets better every year, and even has sponsorships now. I believe it will continue to grow in the future. Thank you to the hard-working TGF staff for taking care of us.\" Please continue reading for their future plans. Shih Hsuan-chung said that if he chooses to continue his studies, he will attend Asia University. He may also choose to serve in the military first and then plan for his future. Regardless of his decision, he will continue to move forward and find his own path. Lin Ping-yi has chosen to attend Ching Yun University of Science and Technology, and he hopes to become better and compete for the championship with his senior teammates in the future. However, the most precious thing for them on this journey is the friendship they have built over the past three years. As they graduate and go their separate ways, they will always hold onto these cherished memories in their hearts. Each of them will shine wherever they go, and they will all find their own path.</p>"},{"location":"20231110091201028137/","title":"T1202324 Season Analysis: Taiwan Beer Yongfeng Clouded Leopard Adds \"War God\" Little An, Record Will Skyrocket","text":"<p>(Cover photo source/T1 League) Despite having the \"strongest\" foreign player in Taiwan history, Dwight Howard, joining the team last season, the core problem of the team was not solved, resulting in the Clouded Leopard becoming the laughingstock of the league with a dismal record of 6 wins and 24 losses   T1202324 Season Analysis: Taiwan Beer Yongfeng Clouded Leopard Adds \"War God\" Little An, Record Will Skyrocket</p> <p>(Cover photo source/T1 League) Despite having the \"strongest\" foreign player in Taiwan history, Dwight Howard, joining the team last season, the core problem of the team was not solved, resulting in the Clouded Leopard becoming the laughingstock of the league with a dismal record of 6 wins and 24 losses.</p> <p>This year, although everyone was expecting Dwight Howard to stay, the Clouded Leopard has merged with Taiwan Beer and not only showed a different playing style in the preseason, but also greatly strengthened their local player lineup. In this season analysis, we will take a look at the Clouded Leopard's situation in the new season from the perspective of the players. Please continue reading to find out how they will soar to victory.</p> <p>To win a game, a team must have a good point guard who can control and change the game. For example, the first season's champion team's \"Brickman\" or the previous season's champion team's Lin Wei-han in the special attack lineup. This season, the Clouded Leopard has added a player of the same level, or even better in scoring ability, Little An, who averaged 16.8 points per game last season, ranking second among local players. His 6.3 assists per game also ranked third among all players. With an average of 6 three-point attempts per game and a shooting percentage of nearly 40%, he is a star player who can change the game. In the past two seasons, the Clouded Leopard's problem has always been the lack of a point guard who can stabilize the situation and lead the team to victory in crucial moments. Little An's addition fills these two important vacancies.</p> <p>Photo source/Taiwan Beer Yongfeng Clouded Leopard official Facebook page Although the two seasons with Little An in the Yulon Luxgen's lineup did not produce ideal results, the problem with the Luxgen is completely different from the Clouded Leopard. The Luxgen has never given its players a clear role and has not established a complete offensive system, and their foreign player choices did not match the team.</p> <p>In this situation, even having a point guard of Little An's caliber was not enough. However, from the preseason games, it seems that the Clouded Leopard will not face this problem. In the two games, we can see that they have a clear and simple offensive system. Of course, there may still be changes in their foreign player choices, especially Devin Williams, who did not seem to fit in with the team in the two games. But overall, the Clouded Leopard has done very well, with efficient two-man combinations, baseline cuts, and shooters lurking on the sidelines or in the corners. In addition, they have Lasan Kromah, a foreign player who can handle fast breaks and one-on-one situations.</p> <p>Photo source/T1 League Looking at the statistics, although the team's three-point shooting percentage in the preseason is somewhat worrying, with the expected immediate contribution of Lin Hsin-kuan only making 1 out of 10 shots in the two games, and Little An himself only making 2 out of 11 three-point attempts, the preseason is meant for players to adjust. Moreover, the team also has Lu Chieh-min, who had a three-point shooting percentage of 39% last season, and shooter Lee Chi-wei. We believe that the Clouded Leopard's game plan is feasible. Please continue reading about Little An, who has MVP-level skills, and the second overall pick, Gao Jin-wei, who is also worth watching.</p> <p>Next, let's talk about the second player worth watching, this year's second overall pick, \"Little Gao\" Gao Jin-wei. In the UBA, he averaged 12.8 points and 4.5 assists per game. In the World University Games, he showed his abilities and talent by making 5 three-pointers and scoring 26 points to lead the Chinese team to victory over the Chinese team. He also made the most three-pointers in the tournament, with a total of 19.</p> <p>His special ability is that he can handle the ball and attack while also being a spot-up shooter, and he has a level of maturity in ball-handling that is uncommon for players of his age. However, no matter how good he is, he also needs a veteran to lead him to the next level. With Little An as a point guard and MVP-level veteran to lead him, we believe that Gao Jin-wei will make great progress and amaze everyone with his performance. Photo source/Taiwan Beer Yongfeng Clouded Leopard official fan page In addition, Gao Jin-wei also has a great chance of being Little An's backup in the new season, and he is a very suitable candidate for this role. This is a luxury that Little An did not have in his time with the Yulon Luxgen. Even though he is already 32 years old, we often see Little An playing for 40 minutes or even the entire game just to get a win. This puts a huge physical burden on him and cannot guarantee that he will have the stamina to lead the team to victory in crucial moments. With a huge upgrade to the team, the Clouded Leopard's goal for the new season is to win games. In summary, the Clouded Leopard has made great improvements this season and has players who can make Little An more comfortable. This team is also more likely to win games and make it to the playoffs, especially with the addition of Justyn Hamilton, the other foreign player this season. Although he does not have a three-point shot, his height, wingspan, and athleticism are impressive. He can drive to the basket and roll in for a layup, making him a perfect fit for the Clouded Leopard, or we could say he is a perfect fit for Little An.</p> <p>The Clouded Leopard's lineup this season is much better than last season, and they have players who can make Little An more comfortable. This lineup also increases their chances of winning games and we believe that fans are looking forward to seeing a stronger Clouded Leopard in the new season. </p>"},{"location":"20231110091233315658/","title":"\u9084\u8a18\u5f97\u5728\u524d\u4e00\u5834\u9762\u5c0d\u66b4\u9f8d\u968a\u6642\uff0c\u7e3d\u6559\u7df4Griffin\u5728\u95dc\u9375\u6642\u523b\u5c07Lillard\u7d66\u653e\u4e0a\u5834\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u73fe\u5728\u771f\u7684\u662f\u6bd4\u8d77Middleton\uff0cLillard\u5c0d\u65bc\u5c0d\u624b\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u4e0d\u662f\u90a3\u9ebc\u6709\u5a01\u8105\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u8b93Middleton\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7a7a\u9593\u53bb\u505a\u81ea\u5df1\u6700\u64c5\u9577\u7684\u4e2d\u8ddd\u96e2\u8df3\u6295\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u5f71\u97ff\u5230\u5c0d\u624b\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u5e6b\u52a9\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u9019\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u6700\u5f8c\u4e00\u64ca\uff0cGiannis\u4e5f\u88ab\u9632\u5b88\u5f97\u5f88\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u6700\u5f8c\u4e3b\u5c07\u4e5f\u662f\u9078\u64c7\u50b3\u7403\u7d66\u5916\u570d\u8a72\u6b7b\u7684Middleton\uff0c\u7d50\u679c\u5462?\u4ed6\u4f9d\u820a\u662f\u4e00\u6a23\u7684\u7a69\u5b9a\uff0c\u95dc\u9375\u6642\u523b\u7684\u4e2d\u8ddd\u96e2\u8df3\u6295\u51fa\u624b\u4e4b\u5f8c\uff0c\u5c0d\u624b\u5c31\u662f\u6c92\u6709\u8fa6\u6cd5\u5c07\u4ed6\u7d66\u5e79\u6389\u3002","text":"<p>\u7e3d\u7d50\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u662f\u4e00\u5834\u6bd4\u8f03\u5c11\u898b\u7684\uff0c\u516c\u9e7f\u968a\u9032\u653b\u7aef\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u95dc\u9375\u6642\u523b\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6210\u529f\u7684\uff0c\u4e5f\u56e0\u6b64\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u5728\u95dc\u9375\u6642\u523b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d0f\u5f97\u6bd4\u8cfd\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u9632\u5b88\u7aef\u7684\u554f\u984c\u4f9d\u820a\u662f\u4e00\u5927\u96b1\u6182\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u9632\u5b88\u7aef\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7403\u968a\u5728\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u6050\u6015\u4ecd\u6703\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7e3d\u6559\u7df4Griffin\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7e8c\u5617\u8a66\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6230\u8853\u8207\u9663\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u80fd\u5920\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u5728\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u516c\u9e7f\u968a\u80fd\u5920\u4fdd\u6301\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5411\u524d\u9081\u9032\u3002</p> <p>After-game Analysis: Bucks' Three-point Shooting Shines in Critical Moments</p> <p>The Bucks have been continuously trying to find their rhythm and maximize their potential on the offensive end    \u9084\u8a18\u5f97\u5728\u524d\u4e00\u5834\u9762\u5c0d\u66b4\u9f8d\u968a\u6642\uff0c\u7e3d\u6559\u7df4Griffin\u5728\u95dc\u9375\u6642\u523b\u5c07Lillard\u7d66\u653e\u4e0a\u5834\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u73fe\u5728\u771f\u7684\u662f\u6bd4\u8d77Middleton\uff0cLillard\u5c0d\u65bc\u5c0d\u624b\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u4e0d\u662f\u90a3\u9ebc\u6709\u5a01\u8105\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u8b93Middleton\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7a7a\u9593\u53bb\u505a\u81ea\u5df1\u6700\u64c5\u9577\u7684\u4e2d\u8ddd\u96e2\u8df3\u6295\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u5f71\u97ff\u5230\u5c0d\u624b\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u5e6b\u52a9\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u9019\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u6700\u5f8c\u4e00\u64ca\uff0cGiannis\u4e5f\u88ab\u9632\u5b88\u5f97\u5f88\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u6700\u5f8c\u4e3b\u5c07\u4e5f\u662f\u9078\u64c7\u50b3\u7403\u7d66\u5916\u570d\u8a72\u6b7b\u7684Middleton\uff0c\u7d50\u679c\u5462?\u4ed6\u4f9d\u820a\u662f\u4e00\u6a23\u7684\u7a69\u5b9a\uff0c\u95dc\u9375\u6642\u523b\u7684\u4e2d\u8ddd\u96e2\u8df3\u6295\u51fa\u624b\u4e4b\u5f8c\uff0c\u5c0d\u624b\u5c31\u662f\u6c92\u6709\u8fa6\u6cd5\u5c07\u4ed6\u7d66\u5e79\u6389\u3002</p> <p>\u7e3d\u7d50\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u662f\u4e00\u5834\u6bd4\u8f03\u5c11\u898b\u7684\uff0c\u516c\u9e7f\u968a\u9032\u653b\u7aef\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u95dc\u9375\u6642\u523b\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6210\u529f\u7684\uff0c\u4e5f\u56e0\u6b64\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u5728\u95dc\u9375\u6642\u523b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d0f\u5f97\u6bd4\u8cfd\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u9632\u5b88\u7aef\u7684\u554f\u984c\u4f9d\u820a\u662f\u4e00\u5927\u96b1\u6182\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u9632\u5b88\u7aef\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7403\u968a\u5728\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u6050\u6015\u4ecd\u6703\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7e3d\u6559\u7df4Griffin\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7e8c\u5617\u8a66\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6230\u8853\u8207\u9663\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u80fd\u5920\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u5728\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u516c\u9e7f\u968a\u80fd\u5920\u4fdd\u6301\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5411\u524d\u9081\u9032\u3002</p> <p>After-game Analysis: Bucks' Three-point Shooting Shines in Critical Moments</p> <p>The Bucks have been continuously trying to find their rhythm and maximize their potential on the offensive end. From preseason to the current season, each game has shown a different style from the Bucks, with head coach Griffin trying out different strategies and tactics for the team. In this game, it was evident that Beasley had a lot of ball control compared to the previous game against the Raptors, where he was almost the first option on offense, often playing hand-in-hand with Giannis. However, in this game against the Knicks, Beasley was almost invisible and spent most of his time squatting in the corner. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the Knicks were well aware of Lillard's recent instability and Middleton's limited playing time, limiting the Bucks' options on offense. Therefore, the Bucks could only focus their firepower on Beasley, who has been in great form recently, helping the Big Three to have more opportunities to mesh together. Please continue reading.</p> <p>In the first quarter, Giannis used his terrifying roll-in threat to help open up space for his other two teammates. At the same time, the other two executed a simple hand-off at the 45-degree angle, challenging the Knicks' defensive communication.</p> <p>Aside from the improved chemistry of the Big Three, the team's fast break transition was also in full force without any hesitation. Whenever there was an opportunity, Giannis would quickly push the ball and charge towards the Knicks' paint, catching them off guard.</p> <p>Please continue reading. This is one of the tactics that the Bucks like to execute. However, instead of having Giannis lead the charge, they switched to Lillard, who has better organization and passing skills. Aside from his elite finishing ability and improved passing skills, Lillard would not recklessly charge into defenders and cause offensive fouls (yes, we're talking about you, Giannis). Against the smaller Knicks lineup, when two stars set a screen, dragging the tall Portis out to the perimeter to defend him, Hartenstein, who was also guarding him, would have to follow, leaving the smaller guards as the last line of defense. This is because Immanuel Quickley, who is weaker on defense and has less help awareness, is the last line of defense. This allows Connaughton to easily run into the open space and score an easy two-pointer.</p> <p>The goal of this tactic is to use Lillard's outside threat to create open space for his teammates. Even when the Bucks players are not in their ideal positions, when facing Lillard's pick-and-roll offense, the Knicks players' instinct is to double-team him and prevent him from taking an outside shot. However, Portis easily slips past the defense and scores an easy two-pointer.</p> <p>Please continue reading. The most straightforward and violent tactic, this is what the Bucks want to see. With the double-star pick-and-roll threat, the Bucks are already terrifying. If there is a moment of hesitation, Giannis will either score an easy two-pointer by charging into the paint or pass it to Lillard for an open three-pointer. However, the real key to elevating the team's offensive threat is the sharpshooters lurking in the weak-side corner. The defense's efficiency is at the bottom, so what? Don't think you can easily score in the paint. After the change in leadership, the team's biggest concern, defense, is still a major issue. From the start of the season until now, the team's defensive efficiency is close to the top of the league (if counting from the bottom).</p> <p>It's expected that the defensive efficiency would drop, but with two DPOY-level players on the team, this performance is unacceptable. In this game against the Knicks, Lopez's seven blocks completely overwhelmed the Knicks players. The main reason I think is that the team had fewer players with physical disadvantages in the backcourt and frontcourt, and the Knicks' starting center Mitchell Robinson does not pose a threat from the perimeter. Therefore, Lopez was able to spend more time guarding the paint, and head coach Griffin decisively put Beasley, who was not playing well, on the bench and substituted in Crowder, who is more aggressive in defensive communication and gives opponents a hard time. At the same time, in the critical moments, Griffin finally loosened the playing time restrictions on Middleton, allowing the team to use a lineup with better physical advantages to compete with the Knicks.</p> <p>Do you remember in the last game against the Raptors, Griffin put Lillard on the court in the critical moments because compared to Middleton, Lillard is not as much of a threat to the opponent's defense. Therefore, Middleton had more space to make his signature mid-range jump shots, which also affected the opponent's defensive help. In the final play of this game, Giannis was also struggling against the defense, and the final option was to pass the ball to Middleton in the corner, who once again showed his consistency and made a mid-range jump shot that the opponent could not stop.</p> <p>In conclusion, this was a rare game where the Bucks' offensive strategy was successful in the critical moments, leading the team to victory. However, the defensive issues are still a major concern, and if they cannot improve on that end, the team's performance in the playoffs may still be limited. Therefore, head coach Griffin needs to continue trying out different tactics and lineups to give the team more possibilities in the playoffs. Lastly, I hope the Bucks can maintain this level of performance and continue to move forward.</p>"},{"location":"20231110091255188601/","title":"Introduction: In this article, we have adapted Tim Cato's Mavs mailbag series in a Q&amp;A format, hoping to help everyone better understand the 2023-24 new Dallas Mavericks","text":"<p>Introduction: In this article, we have adapted Tim Cato's Mavs mailbag series in a Q&amp;A format, hoping to help everyone better understand the 2023-24 new Dallas Mavericks. The main content of this article includes: 1. According to Jason Kidd, at least one rookie has a chance to enter the starting lineup this year. Who do you think will be the lucky one, Olivier-Maxence Prosper or Dereck Lively II? Like many coaches, Kidd tends to trust veterans rather than young players, but both Lively and O-Max have a high chance of becoming immediate contributors and even pushing into the starting lineup before December, despite Kidd's statement that \"teams can't rely on young players to win.\" However, these two young players are just that good and are worthy of more expectations. Keep reading to find out more about Lively and O-Max's defensive awareness and understanding of their role on the offensive end, which makes them more trustworthy than Josh Green and Jaden Hardy, and closer to the reliable Reggie Bullock, who played his career-high minutes under Kidd last year.</p> <p>Considering the team's vision of needing a big wing and a starting center, don't be surprised if they get more playing time this season.</p> <p>As for their future development? It all depends on their own destiny. Further reading: Will there be a successor to \"The King of Boxing\" Tyson Chandler? Rookie center Dereck Lively and the Mavericks' first summer. Keep reading 2. How will the Mavericks view the roles of Tim Hardaway Jr., Jaden Hardy, and Seth Curry in the new season? THJ and Seth Curry should be ahead of Jaden Hardy in terms of playing time, there should be no doubt about that. Seth has missed an average of 21 games in the past four seasons, and Hardaway is well aware of the team's efforts to trade him, even saying on media day, \"To be honest, I'm not even sure if I'll still be playing here this season.\" If he does get traded, it wouldn't be too surprising. Hardy will be a backup in case of injuries to the above two players, and he can also fill in for Kyrie Irving, especially when he is limited by health issues.</p> <p>Hardy's ability is enough to earn him more playing time, as we have already seen towards the end of last season, and the coaching staff will continue to find suitable opportunities for him.</p> <p>Keep reading 3. Will the team be satisfied with their current center rotation? This is a very interesting question. During the offseason, the Mavericks were frequently rumored to be trying to acquire a star center, including Deandre Ayton and Clint Capela, with the former eventually being sent to the Trail Blazers.</p> <p>Considering that Lively was already being discussed as a possible starter so early on, the team's situation still needs to be further observed.</p> <p>Perhaps the Mavericks still lack a \"starting-level\" big man to compete for the championship, but is it really necessary to pay a higher price at this stage? The current center rotation is enough to deal with this year's games, and Lively's rate of growth will determine the direction of this issue. 4. In recent years, the Mavericks have always given us a lot of surprises on the trade deadline, but the composition of the team for this season has already taken shape in the preseason. Can we predict the rotation lineup after the All-Star break? Before answering this question, we have two things to consider. One is \"whether the rookies will enter the rotation,\" and the other is \"whether the Mavericks can trade away Hardaway.\" If we optimistically assume that the answer to both questions is yes, the starting lineup could be Doncic, Irving, Josh Green, Grant Williams, and Dwight Powell; at times, O-Max and Lively will have the opportunity to replace Green and Powell, and Seth Curry and Maxi Kleber will also be key bench players. Derrick Jones Jr. could be the next member to compete for playing time, as his defense and athleticism can complement Doncic well, and he has a stronger presence than his official listed height of 6 feet 5, which could be a small-ball center alternative for Kidd.</p> <p>As for Richaun Holmes, his role is not that prominent and may overlap with Powell and Lively, so we need to see how things play out when the season starts.</p> <p>Further reading: A $6 million \"win-win-win\" gamble? Grant Williams talks about the Celtics' and Mavericks' journey in the trade. This is a lineup with two stars, a quality starter, and a group of young players and veteran reserves.</p> <p>If Green can make a leap in his fourth year, the situation will be even better. But if the rookies don't perform well, things could get a bit awkward.</p> <p>Perhaps Doncic will continue to improve the team's strength, and hopefully, THJ's trade will bring back another good player - ideally with a contract that can last until summer, making the team's salary and trade situation healthier - but these are things that need time to prove, and hopefully Doncic will continue to dominate while Irving stays healthy. So there is still a lot to do!

<p>Based on reports from ESPN journalist Adrian Wojnarowski and Bleacher Report journalist Chris Haynes, Philadelphia 76ers guard James Harden has returned to the team for practice after missing 10 days of training camp. However, he was denied boarding the team's flight to an away game, as the team felt he was not ready to play and wanted him to continue training at the team's facility with the coaches and medical staff to get into game shape.</p> <p>The 76ers decided to keep Harden in Philadelphia, citing it as a \"personal matter\". But with the league implementing new rules on player attendance, specifically not allowing players to miss games or rest without a valid reason, the league has the right to investigate and fine the team for any violations. The league will look into the reason for Harden's absence and the 76ers will have to provide an explanation.</p> <p>According to Haynes' report, Harden's camp believes that the team's decision to not let him travel was to prevent any off-court distractions. If he had traveled with the team, he would likely have been asked to sit on the bench and could have potentially caused issues with his teammates and coaches. The report also states that his teammates feel that Harden is in good shape, as he had been training intensely at a resort in Aspen, Colorado, with a team of 12 personnel including a basketball trainer, fitness coach, nutritionist, and chef.</p> <p>However, there were no fines imposed on Harden by the team for his absence during training camp, according to ESPN's report.</p>"},{"location":"20231111091128998710/","title":"202324 Season Analysis: Tainan Taiwan Steel Eagles Return to Triple Towers Lineup, Can They Make it to the Finals Again?","text":"<p>Last season, the Eagles were the most improved team in the league    202324 Season Analysis: Tainan Taiwan Steel Eagles Return to Triple Towers Lineup, Can They Make it to the Finals Again?</p> <p>Last season, the Eagles were the most improved team in the league. They went from a record of 6 wins and 24 losses in their first season to making it to the finals. Although they were swept by the special attack team, it was still a very successful season for the Eagles. But after a summer break, can this Triple Towers lineup lead the team back to the finals or even win the championship? Last season, the three towers combined for an average of 61.4 points and 36.1 rebounds per game. Among them, A-Shiva was the most important, with an average of 61.4 points and 36.1 rebounds per game. Singh Bhullar and Samuel Deguara also had impressive field goal percentages of 69% and 70% respectively.</p> <p>In addition, A-Shiva (Robert Upshaw III) is the core of the team, having played 25 games last season and averaging 21.8 points, 12 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game. Most importantly, he attempted an average of 5.6 three-point shots per game with a 35% success rate. While this may not be a high percentage, it is rare to see a 213cm tall center provide such firepower both inside and outside the paint. This makes him the most indispensable tower in the Triple Towers lineup.</p> <p>However, from the two official warm-up games and the league's opening game, it seems that the Eagles' proud \"Triple Towers\" lineup is no longer the same. Please continue reading for the source of the photos/Tainan Taiwan Steel Eagles official fan page. Is the \"Triple Towers\" lineup cracking? A-Shiva scored 0 points and 8 rebounds in the opening game. However, after a summer break, A-Shiva not only suffered an injury in an NBL game and made a statement on IG that he ended his remaining NBL season due to his teammate Deguara playing too dirty, but also there seems to be an irreparable rift in this \"Triple Towers\" lineup. Although A-Shiva's injury had healed before the official warm-up game, he did not play in the game. Coach Liu Mengzhu's explanation was that he wanted A-Shiva to be healthy and well-prepared for the opening game. However, A-Shiva's performance in the opening game was disappointing. Apart from a noticeable decline in his physical condition, he only played for 12 minutes and missed both of his shots, resulting in a poor stat line of 0 points and 8 rebounds. If A-Shiva cannot quickly regain his physical and game feel, it will undoubtedly have a huge impact on the entire team.</p> <p>Source of photos/T1 League Apart from A-Shiva, there are also concerns about Bhullar's condition. Although he had a good performance of 14 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 blocks in the warm-up game with a field goal percentage of 66.7%, there were still visible signs of physical decline. Among the three players, only Deguara seems to have maintained or even slightly improved. He scored 45 points against the War Gods in the warm-up game and almost recorded a double-double of 22 points and 19 rebounds against the special attack team in the opening game. However, as the game went on, it was apparent that Deguara's physical strength was not enough to dominate the game. Moreover, it is evident that the team or Deguara himself hopes to at least improve his mobility, so he had to use more energy to run in this game. As a result, the Eagles once again lost to the special attack team. The Eagles' problems remain, with no outside shooting and no playmaking. In fact, from this opening game, it is evident that the Eagles have not solved the problems from last season. Although they have acquired several players, including Su Yijin, who are descendants of the Suns, and also signed a foreign player, Kim Kin, who has a good scoring ability, they still lack a stable outside shooter and a playmaking guard. The team's three-point shooting percentage was only 34.4% and they had 15 assists with 24 turnovers, indicating that the Eagles will have an even worse record than last season if they continue like this. Moreover, this three-point shooting percentage was achieved with Kin making 5 of 8 three-pointers, but his three-point percentage was less than 30% last season. So it is almost impossible to expect him to maintain this shooting percentage in future games. Source of photos/T1 League It will be challenging to rely on Kin alone to change the team's style of play. Coach Liu Mengzhu once mentioned in an interview that after Kin joined the team, the Triple Towers lineup might not be seen as frequently because he hopes to improve the team's speed on both offense and defense. This is a good idea and direction, as well as the only area where the Eagles can improve on their weaknesses from last season. In the opening game, it was evident that the Eagles wanted to push the pace after grabbing a defensive rebound, but this resulted in consecutive turnovers. In the second half, the team could still be seen trying to feed the ball into the paint, but as Deguara's physical strength declined, this tactic resulted in more turnovers. The congested paint also made it difficult for the forwards to make backdoor cuts. The lack of a plan for outside shooting and a finishing point also led to turnovers even when trying to make passes at the top of the arc.

However, the score difference between the two teams was quite significant in today's game. Despite being plagued with injuries, the Purple and Gold continued to use an eight-man rotation, but this strategy that helped them defeat the Clippers last game did not bring them victory today. With significant flaws in both offense and defense, the Lakers ultimately lost 101-120 to the Magic, dropping their record back to 50% (3 wins, 3 losses).</p> <p>Please continue reading about Anthony Davis' impressive stats behind the scenes. Davis scored 28 points, grabbed 13 rebounds, and had 7 blocks, all while being limited by foul trouble and only playing 32 minutes. One of the reasons for Davis' limited playing time was because he had already committed 3 fouls before the end of the first half. It must be said that without Davis, the Lakers' defense would have been even more lacking. The team's lack of defensive effort was a key factor in their defeat. Although the Lakers had 6 steals and 10 blocks compared to the Magic's 6 steals and 10 blocks, the Lakers' defense still had many issues, especially in the first half where they allowed the Magic to score 67 points (39 of which were in the first quarter). It's worth noting that before this game, the Magic were only averaging 107.6 points per game, ranking 23rd in the league.</p> <p>The Lakers had many turnovers in the first half, giving the Magic opportunities for fast breaks. However, their transition defense was not ideal, especially when they had their \"twin towers\" on the court. In the middle of the first quarter, Davis found his rhythm and scored three consecutive baskets. The Magic quickly responded by sending a double team when Davis had the ball in the low post, causing him to turn the ball over. Additionally, the Magic's young guards, such as Anthony Black and Jalen Suggs, were very aggressive on defense and played a crucial role in initiating early offense and finding open teammates on the perimeter to punish the Lakers' passive defensive rotations.</p> <p>Despite the Lakers' decent defense and shot-blocking, they were unable to secure many rebounds, especially on the offensive end. With key players such as Rui Hachimura, Taurean Prince, Jarred Vanderbilt, and Gabe Vincent out due to injuries, the Lakers' defense was put to the test. In this game, they were unable to communicate well on defense like they did in their last game, and they were unable to fully utilize their twin towers. Instead, they gave the Magic many scoring opportunities in the mid-range and inside the paint. D'Angelo Russell, who started in place of the injured players, lacked focus on defense, and Cam Reddish was unable to contain the more physical Paolo Banchero. The projected 2022 number 1 draft pick had an all-around game, scoring 25 points, grabbing 7 rebounds, and dishing out 10 assists with a 60% shooting percentage and 50% from the three-point line. This was a stark contrast from his previous 4 games where he only averaged 12.5 points and shot less than 40%.</p> <p>In the first half, the Magic incorporated many off-ball screens and backdoor cuts, causing problems for the Lakers, especially in the first three quarters. They often used pick-and-rolls to pull Davis out of the paint, taking away the Lakers' biggest defensive advantage and allowing Banchero, Franz Wagner, and others to easily attack the basket. Without their starting center, Wendell Carter Jr., the Magic started 6'11\" Goga Bitadze, who was not able to effectively limit Davis' scoring, but he and Moritz Wagner took turns protecting the paint and helped the Magic outrebound the Lakers.</p> <p>One of the reasons the Lakers were trailing in the first half was their lack of second-chance points and offensive rebounds. In the first two quarters, the Lakers only grabbed 1 offensive rebound compared to the Magic's 11. This also helped the Magic score 26 points off of second chances. The Lakers' slow start and poor offensive efficiency were on full display, and when they tried to make a comeback in the fourth quarter, it was too late. LeBron James was still the Lakers' main offensive threat, scoring 24 points, grabbing 9 rebounds, and dishing out 5 assists. He became more aggressive in the second half and drove to the basket more often, but it was too little too late.</p> <p>In the crucial moments of the game, the Lakers' outside shooting was not reliable, especially DLo, who played the second-most minutes on the team and only made 1 out of 10 three-point attempts. His consecutive missed threes in the fourth quarter also killed the Lakers' momentum, and his poor defense did not help the team either. In the absence of Prince and Vanderbilt, the only remaining small forward was Reddish, who had a very off night. He only needed to focus on defense and provide some outside shooting, but he was unable to do either effectively.</p> <p>In summary, the lack of depth cannot be used as an excuse for the Lakers' loss. Facing a younger and more aggressive Magic team, the Lakers' attitude from the beginning was not what a championship team should have. Their rebounding, outside shooting, and team defense were all problematic, despite having a talented roster on paper.

The trade sent Robert Williams, Malcolm Brogdon, and the 2024 Golden State Warriors' first-round pick and the 2029 unprotected Boston Celtics' first-round pick to the Blazers.</p> <p>The Warriors' first-round pick is protected for the top four, and it is likely to be redeemed this season.</p> <p>While Jrue Holiday is a great player, he doesn't fit into the Blazers' rebuilding plans. The team quickly posted news of DeAndre Ayton joining the team, but there was no mention of Jrue Holiday. This made it clear that the Blazers were planning to trade him. The new addition, Malcolm Brogdon, doesn't fit into the team's timeline due to his age and position, and he may be the next player to be put on the trading block. Robert Williams' situation is also intriguing. He has been inconsistent and has had injury concerns (a knee injury that Blazers fans are all too familiar with), but he still has three years left on his contract and is only 26 years old.</p> <p>However, his incredible rim protection and shot-blocking abilities are rare in the league and have been a major need for the Blazers on the defensive end. If they can figure out his role on the offensive end, the Blazers will have a strong frontcourt presence.</p> <p>It's too early to discuss the Blazers' potential starting lineup, as they are likely to continue to trade Brogdon and push for another deal. Since Brogdon's salary is a significant $22.5 million, the team may have to trade for another high-priced player to make the salaries match. This could result in a chain of trades, creating a trade machine. The Blazers have been rapidly accumulating assets, and if we were to consider who has made the most progress in the 2023 season, it would have to be general manager Joe Cronin. His recent trades have not only accumulated assets but also brought in high-caliber players who have proven their abilities.</p> <p>These players all have a clear role on the team: Jrue Holiday's ball-handling and lockdown defense, DeAndre Ayton's athleticism, Malcolm Brogdon's efficiency and high basketball IQ, and Robert Williams' elite rim protection.</p> <p>Not only do they possess great skills, but they are also considered top players in their respective fields in the league. This makes it easier for the Blazers to find trade partners and create more competition, resulting in better trade conditions.</p> <p>With the decision to part ways with Lillard, the Blazers have officially entered a full rebuild mode. This also means that no player on the team is untouchable, except for players like Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe, who the team plans to develop in the long term. Even players like Jerami Grant and Matisse Thybulle, who were just signed during the offseason, could be moved after the league's trade restrictions have been lifted.</p> <p>In just two years, Joe Cronin has completely revamped the Blazers' lineup. Besides Anfernee Simons, the rest of the team has been acquired since last season.</p> <p>After a series of trades, the Blazers have a brand new look. Similar to what Sam Presti did with the Thunder, the Blazers' rebuilding process has been surprisingly fast. In these two trades, the Blazers acquired three first-round picks and two young talents. And it's still ongoing. Cronin's trades keep getting better and better. The 2023 Trail Blazers summer: rebuilding is necessary. The current situation is frustrating, with zero reinforcements.

However, due to groupings and other factors, the two teams have not met each other in recent years. The last time they faced each other was in the 2014 World Cup, where Lithuania managed to defeat the US team in the preliminary round.</p> <p>In fact, Lithuania almost made history in the 2000 Sydney Olympics when they came close to defeating the US team in the semi-finals.

Reports of communication issues between players and coaches surfaced again at the end of last season, causing this talented and deep team to once again fall short due to locker room problems.</p> <p>However, after a busy offseason of management and coaching changes, the Celtics have emerged as a dominant force in the East once again. So what can we expect from this team in the upcoming season? Joe Mazzulla's re-challenge as head coach Despite being thrown into the position last season, Mazzulla led the team to their best performance since the \"Big 3\" era. Although his in-game adjustments and decisions were questioned by many, it's important to remember that he is still a relatively inexperienced head coach.</p> <p>With the trust of the management and a revamped coaching staff that includes former Bucks assistant coach Charles Lee and 76ers assistant coach Sam Cassell, Mazzulla will have the support of two experienced assistant coaches to help address the team's locker room and player management issues.</p> <p>Despite losing defensive stalwarts Marcus Smart and Robert Williams in the offseason, under Brad Stevens' management, the additions of Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is and Jrue Holiday not only maintained the team's defensive strength, but also raised their offensive potential. Preseason games have also shown a different offensive strategy compared to last season. However, with four players on the team who had a usage rate of over 25% last season, Mazzulla will have to carefully manage and distribute the ball.</p> <p>Key player to watch this season: Payton Pritchard Despite having a disappointing season last year and even expressing his desire to be traded, Pritchard remained on the team and even signed a 4-year, $30 million extension. Some fans may think he's just another undersized shooting guard, but in preseason games, Pritchard has shown that he's more than just a shooter. He has solid ball-handling skills, can create space for himself and his teammates with pick-and-rolls, and even uses advanced techniques like the hostage dribble to set up easy shots for his big men. It will be interesting to see if he can continue this level of play against tougher defenses in the regular season.</p> <p>Another advantage of Pritchard is his ability to adapt to both on-ball and off-ball roles. With a less crowded backcourt this season after the departure of sixth man Malcolm Brogdon, Pritchard will have the opportunity to play consistent minutes and potentially have a breakout season.</p> <p>Key word for the Celtics this season: Clutch Time Looking at the numbers, the Celtics had a 24-13 record in 37 clutch time games last season, a decent winning percentage. However, they also had a significant drop in performance after the All-Star break and blew several double-digit leads, causing some fans to view them as an inconsistent team. While Tatum and Brown have shown flashes of clutch performances in regular season games, they have yet to prove themselves as leaders in high-pressure playoff situations.</p> <p>The Miami Heat and Jimmy Butler in last season's playoffs are a good example of how to win in clutch time. With a strong starting lineup, the Celtics' main focus this season will be maintaining their lead when they have it. As for who will take the last shot in clutch situations, with a deep roster and a new coaching staff, it's unlikely that Mazzulla will only design \"On The Run\" plays for Tatum. </p> <p>Potential concern this season: Resting and injury management With the league's stricter Player Participation Policy (PPP), teams are no longer allowed to rest more than two star players at a time. This will be a challenge for the Celtics, as Tatum and Brown have been among the league leaders in minutes played in recent seasons. With the introduction of mid-season tournaments, players will also need to play at least 20 minutes to be eligible for individual awards. This may be a concern for Tatum and Brown, who have shouldered a heavy workload in recent years, and will also test the coaching staff's ability to integrate the team and reduce their usage in the regular season.</p>"},{"location":"20231111091226902963/","title":"Guan Dayou: The Unexpected Star of the Flying Apes in the 2223 Season","text":"<p>In the 2223 season, the surprising player of the Flying Apes team has always been Guan Dayou </p> <p>In the 2223 season, the surprising player of the Flying Apes team has always been Guan Dayou. In his first season as a rookie, he stood out from the bench and even started for a while.</p> <p>In the second season, Guan Dayou returned to the bench but gained the coach's trust in the middle of the season.</p> <p>However, after Coach Caminos joined the team, Guan Dayou's playing time and number of appearances hit an all-time low.</p> <p>Even though he remained healthy throughout the season, his average playing time dropped to only 10 minutes. This time, Guan Dayou did not have the same comeback as before. It was obvious that under Coach Caminos' system, Guan Dayou often received blame and this continued for the entire season.</p> <p>This also presented the biggest challenge for Guan Dayou since he entered the professional league. Even during the middle of the season, Guan Dayou expressed on social media his desire to play. Is Guan Dayou not training diligently? Based on his past seasons where he fought for playing time from the bench, he definitely has the ability, but is his value what Coach Caminos is looking for? After Coach Caminos joined the team, the Flying Apes emphasized stability and reduced their fast break ratio, which removed the open style of play that Guan Dayou relied on. Once the pace slowed down and entered half-court play, the offense became heavily reliant on individual one-on-one skills and reading the game, which are not Guan Dayou's strengths. Since the team changed their style and direction, Guan Dayou has struggled to adapt.</p> <p>In the cross-league invitation tournament, once Guan Dayou's engine starts, he can leave most defenders behind.</p> <p>Just in terms of explosiveness and speed, Guan Dayou clearly has the level of a professional player, but the question is how he can utilize his skills.</p> <p>Please continue reading below. Although struggling to adapt is related to the new direction of the Flying Apes, the author believes that playing half-court basketball is a natural thing, even if Guan Dayou goes to a team that plays an open style, he will thrive.</p> <p>When the game becomes tense, there will always be a need to play half-court basketball. The author believes that this is a turning point in Guan Dayou's career. If he can understand the art of half-court offense and combine it with his physical and active defense, his value will definitely rise. How to adapt to the battlefield of half-court basketball will be the biggest challenge for Guan Dayou in his fourth season.</p> <p>This is not an easy skill to master and it's not something that can be learned by practicing alone. Please continue reading below for the analysis of the team's style this season.</p> <p>Even though it was known at the beginning of the season that the Flying Apes were lacking in point guards, Coach Caminos did not immediately promote Guan Dayou, who had often served as a backup point guard in the past. Instead, he let Shi Jinyao take over Wu Jiajun's position. It wasn't until the second half of the season that Guan Dayou started getting more playing time and became the point guard.</p> <p>However, Guan Dayou still lacks the ability to read the defense and often gets his timing off despite his explosiveness. Therefore, the main reason Coach Caminos lets Guan Dayou play is for his defensive skills.</p> <p>This task is not unfamiliar to Guan Dayou, as it was also highly valued by the Flying Apes in the third season.</p> <p>However, there are many defensive aces on the Flying Apes team, and Guan Dayou is not Coach Caminos' first choice. When there are important defensive tasks, Coach Caminos still relies on Huang Honghan, Shi Jinyao, and Chen Yurui, or even the newly activated Li Jiakang in the second half of the season.</p> <p>Although Guan Dayou has excellent individual defensive skills and natural talent, the author believes that his performance in team defense this season is not that great (refer to the animation below). On the offensive end, Guan Dayou is still the familiar and sharp fast break arrow, but in the Flying Apes, this skill set seems to be gathering dust. As mentioned earlier, the Flying Apes have tried playing fast break at one point, and during that time, Guan Dayou's performance was outstanding and even scored 15 points in a single game.</p> <p>If we only look at his performance on the court, it seems that Guan Dayou's progress this year is relatively small and we haven't seen many new skills.</p> <p>In fact, Guan Dayou has had more turnovers than steady improvements in his three years. In his first season, he had a turnover every 1.3 assists.</p> <p>In the second season, it improved to 1.6 times, and in the third season, it reached 2.0 times, and this was even with his playing time cut in half from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. This may be related to his role, as he played less as a point guard this season and his possession time may have decreased.</p> <p>But regardless, the improvement in assist-turnover ratio is something that the Flying Apes are happy about, as the team did a good job controlling turnovers last season.</p> <p>Lastly, let's summarize Guan Dayou's performance this season with the animation below. This play is a successful elevator door tactic executed by Guan Dayou, and Dreamer didn't guard his man properly. The position and pace that Guan Dayou created were comfortable, and he made a quick pass for Zhang Zhenya to score. This was the Flying Apes' first offensive play in the second quarter of a certain game. Behind this successful tactic, it may have been Coach Caminos' command. Also, the reason this elevator door tactic was successful was that the defender guarding Zhang Zhenya was not focused enough at that moment, it was not because of Guan Dayou's actions. On the court, it still felt like a training drill. The author believes that the paint was empty at that moment, and the defender was too relaxed. With his superior physical and explosive abilities compared to Wu Jiajun, Guan Dayou could have tried to disrupt the defender's focus by making a cut. This season, we have seen Guan Dayou complete his point guard duties successfully a few times, but there are still many areas where he can improve his tactical thinking and observation of defenders.

In the new season, he will be a member of the Kings' guard and will not expect to play against his former teammates from the Iron and Steel Man team on the court. After announcing his joining the Kings last Thursday, Lin held a press conference and practice at the New Taipei Sports Center today. Regarding his decision to leave the Iron and Steel Man team and join the Kings as a free agent, he said, \"4 or 5 teammates from the Iron and Steel Man team sent me messages to congratulate me and are looking forward to playing against me. The experience with the Iron and Steel Man team last year will always be remembered, but playing against them is not fun for me, so I don't expect to play against them.\" After joining the Iron and Steel Man team last year, Jeremy Lin took on the role of team leader and led the team to a strong finish in the second half of the season. He emphasized that he will bring the same leadership qualities to the Kings. \"I believe it is important to unite the team. My playing style and role will be different in different teams, but the most important thing is to unite the team. This is the first goal as a guard.\" Speaking of his new teammates, Jeremy Lin is looking forward to working with foreign players Manny Harris and Marcus Thornton. He also specifically mentioned Kings guard Lee Kai-Yan, \"I think Kai-Yan has not reached his full potential yet. His abilities are much better than what he has shown.\" The Kings will face the Dreamers and Iron and Steel Man teams in the PLG preseason games on October 7-9. Whether he will make his debut in the first public game after joining the team, Jeremy Lin emphasized that he will follow the coach's arrangements. \"I'm not sure if I will play in the preseason game, it depends on the coach. I just arrived, so I can't guarantee that I won't play or how much playing time I will get.\" Jeremy Lin practices in the Kings' training jersey.

Star player James Harden, who has had a falling out with the team's general manager Daryl Morey, has publicly expressed his desire to be traded. It was rumored that he wanted to join the Los Angeles Clippers and form a superstar team with Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and Russell Westbrook, but no trade has materialized yet.</p> <p>During the media day before the Sixers' training camp, Harden was absent, which only fueled the rumors of a potential trade. The question now is not whether Harden wants to leave, but whether Morey wants to keep him. It seems that a separation is inevitable.</p> <p>However, even though the Sixers have a strong team, they may have trouble finding a trade partner for the 34-year-old superstar. Harden's absence during media day and the first day of training camp may have been a tactic to make the Sixers uncomfortable and push them to make a trade. Both sides want a separation, so why has it not happened yet? Let's discuss a few factors.</p> <p>Firstly, the timing is not in favor of a trade. Most of the top teams in the league, such as the Nuggets, Suns, Lakers, Warriors, Clippers, Bucks, Celtics, Heat, and Knicks, have already completed their roster before and after the potential Harden trade. It is now much harder to make a trade to a specific team, which was possible during the offseason. This is not an ideal situation for the Rockets.</p> <p>Moreover, Harden has a specific team in mind that he wants to join. Being in the later stage of his career, he has already achieved many individual accolades and was even selected as one of the top 75 players in NBA history. He has also sacrificed his salary to help the Rockets improve their roster. However, he is still missing a championship ring, and he wants to join a team that has a chance to compete for a championship. This narrows down his potential trade destinations to only 5-8 teams.</p> <p>Additionally, Harden also wants to return to his hometown to play, which leaves only the Lakers and the Clippers as options. However, the Lakers may not be interested in him after their failed attempt to pair him with Westbrook last season.</p> <p>The Lakers have had a successful offseason, keeping their core players and making some significant additions. They have upgraded their roster with Christian Wood and Gabe Vincent, who are versatile and can play both inside and outside. They also have a strong backup center in Jaxson Hayes and potential young talents in Taurean Prince and Cam Reddish. With LeBron James and Anthony Davis leading the team, the Lakers have a strong chance of defeating the Nuggets, who are considered one of the top teams in the West.</p> <p>The Lakers do not have a strong incentive to trade for Harden. The Rockets and other potential trade partners are in a similar situation, making it unlikely for any team to break up their team just a few weeks before the start of the season to make room for Harden. This is not an ideal situation for the Rockets.</p> <p>For the Sixers, the decision to trade Harden depends on their championship aspirations and his value to the team. Their star player, Joel Embiid, still has four years left on his contract, while both Harden and Tobias Harris only have one year left. With their main competitors in the East improving their roster, it may be necessary for the Sixers to make a move to keep their championship hopes alive. However, trading Harden would mean losing a key player, and it would not be an easy decision.</p> <p>The Sixers have to weigh their options carefully and make a decision that is in the best interest of the team. If they decide to trade Harden, they would need to get a fair return to make up for his absence. This is different from the Trail Blazers' trade of Lillard, where they had a long-term contract with him and could afford to wait for the right trade offer.</p> <p>Harden's contract expires after this season, making it a crucial year for him. If the Sixers cannot find a suitable trade partner before the season ends, he could leave as a free agent, which would be detrimental to the team. It is better for the Sixers to make a decision now and part ways with Harden peacefully. This was also the case when they resolved the trade rumors surrounding Ben Simmons last year, which ultimately led to the arrival of Harden in Philadelphia.</p> <p>The Sixers have stated that they are not looking to trade Harden, but recent reports of a strained relationship between the player and the team suggest otherwise. They are not actively seeking a trade, but if a suitable offer presents itself, they may consider it. After all, the team's success is their top priority. Let's wait and see where Harden will end up and how this situation will unfold.</p>"},{"location":"20231112091151308257/","title":"The Nuggets defeated the Warriors at home","text":"<p>The Nuggets defeated the Warriors at home.</p> <p>Photo/Reuters</p> <p>The Warriors and Nuggets faced off at the Nuggets' home court today, with both Draymond Green and Jamal Murray missing from the game.</p> <p>In the first quarter, the Nuggets took the lead with strong play in the paint.

League</p> <p>The T1 League pre-season games continued on the second day, with Tai-Power Yulon Leopards playing against Kaohsiung FamilyMart Warriors. Despite adding key players such as Chiang Yu-An and Huang Chen during the off-season, and selecting rookies Lin Hsin-Kuan and Kao Chin-Wei in the draft, the new lineup of Tai-Power Yulon Leopards failed to perform as expected in their first game, ultimately losing to Kaohsiung FamilyMart Warriors by 98-94.</p> <p>Last season, Yulon Leopards, who failed to make it to the playoffs despite having \"The Beast\" Dwight Howard on their team, merged with Tai-Power and formed \"Tai-Power Yulon Leopards\" to compete in the third season of the T1 League. In addition to the addition of national team players such as Chiang Yu-An, Huang Chen, and Lee Chi-Wei, this year's Tai-Power Yulon Leopards also welcomed the two big men rookies, Kao Chin-Wei and Lin Hsin-Kuan, creating high expectations for the team's performance. However, in the first pre-season game against the well-structured Kaohsiung FamilyMart Warriors, the new lineup of Tai-Power Yulon Leopards failed to gel as expected, especially with new additions Chiang Yu-An and Huang Chen having little room to showcase their skills in the first half. The team only had 5 assists in the first half, a stark contrast to the Warriors' 17. By halftime, the Warriors had a comfortable 14-point lead. However, in the second half, Tai-Power Yulon Leopards gradually found their rhythm, with Chiang Yu-An and Lin Hsin-Kuan both making their first field goals of the game in the fourth quarter. Substitute Luo Chen-Feng also made a three-pointer and a two-handed dunk, helping Tai-Power Yulon Leopards to cut the deficit to 6 points. Despite key baskets from Yu Huan-Ya and Kusas, Cheng Wei made a three-pointer with 23.5 seconds left, bringing the team within 4 points. However, Tai-Power Yulon Leopards failed to score again, ultimately losing to Kaohsiung FamilyMart Warriors by 4 points. In today's game, foreign player Hamilton led Tai-Power Yulon Leopards with 23 points and 12 rebounds, while Kromah had 12 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists. Chiang Yu-An came off the bench for 27 minutes and recorded 9 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists. For the Warriors, foreign player Jones had 24 points and Yu Huan-Ya had 15 points.</p>"},{"location":"20231112091232736523/","title":"\u6839\u64da\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u862d\u8b66\u5bdf\u5c40\u7684\u5831\u544a\uff0cAltman\u88ab\u9001\u5f80\u91ab\u9662\u9032\u884c\u8840\u6db2\u6aa2\u6e2c\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u7576\u665a\u88ab\u91cb\u653e\u3002\u9a0e\u58eb\u968a\u5b98\u65b9\u5c1a\u672a\u5c0d\u6b64\u4e8b\u767c\u8868\u8072\u660e\u3002","text":"<p>Altman\u662f\u9a0e\u58eb\u968a\u57282017\u5e74\u4efb\u547d\u7684\u7e3d\u7ba1\uff0c\u4e26\u57282018\u5e74\u5e36\u9818\u7403\u968a\u6649\u7d1a\u7e3d\u6c7a\u8cfd\u3002\u4ed6\u4e5f\u662fNBA\u4e2d\u6700\u5e74\u8f15\u7684\u7e3d\u7ba1\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5e74\u50c536\u6b72\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u9019\u6b21\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5c07\u4f7f\u4ed6\u7684\u5f62\u8c61\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5f71\u97ff\u5230\u4ed6\u5728\u7403\u968a\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\u3002</p> <p>\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u9a0e\u58eb\u968a\u5c1a\u672a\u5c31Altman\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u767c\u8868\u5b98\u65b9\u8072\u660e\uff0c\u4e5f\u6c92\u6709\u900f\u9732\u4ed6\u662f\u5426\u5c07\u7e7c\u7e8c\u64d4\u4efb\u7e3d\u7ba1\u4e00\u8077\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u9019\u6b21\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u6050\u6015\u4e0d\u6703\u90a3\u9ebc\u8f15\u5fae\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u7403\u968a\u548c\u7403\u8ff7\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u5e0c\u671bAltman\u80fd\u5920\u5f9e\u4e2d\u5438\u53d6\u6559\u8a13\uff0c\u56de\u6b78\u6b63\u8ecc\u3002   \u6839\u64da\u514b\u91cc\u592b\u862d\u8b66\u5bdf\u5c40\u7684\u5831\u544a\uff0cAltman\u88ab\u9001\u5f80\u91ab\u9662\u9032\u884c\u8840\u6db2\u6aa2\u6e2c\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u7576\u665a\u88ab\u91cb\u653e\u3002\u9a0e\u58eb\u968a\u5b98\u65b9\u5c1a\u672a\u5c0d\u6b64\u4e8b\u767c\u8868\u8072\u660e\u3002</p> <p>Altman\u662f\u9a0e\u58eb\u968a\u57282017\u5e74\u4efb\u547d\u7684\u7e3d\u7ba1\uff0c\u4e26\u57282018\u5e74\u5e36\u9818\u7403\u968a\u6649\u7d1a\u7e3d\u6c7a\u8cfd\u3002\u4ed6\u4e5f\u662fNBA\u4e2d\u6700\u5e74\u8f15\u7684\u7e3d\u7ba1\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5e74\u50c536\u6b72\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u9019\u6b21\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5c07\u4f7f\u4ed6\u7684\u5f62\u8c61\u53d7\u5230\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5f71\u97ff\u5230\u4ed6\u5728\u7403\u968a\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\u3002</p> <p>\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u9a0e\u58eb\u968a\u5c1a\u672a\u5c31Altman\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u767c\u8868\u5b98\u65b9\u8072\u660e\uff0c\u4e5f\u6c92\u6709\u900f\u9732\u4ed6\u662f\u5426\u5c07\u7e7c\u7e8c\u64d4\u4efb\u7e3d\u7ba1\u4e00\u8077\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u9019\u6b21\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u6050\u6015\u4e0d\u6703\u90a3\u9ebc\u8f15\u5fae\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bc\u7403\u968a\u548c\u7403\u8ff7\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u5e0c\u671bAltman\u80fd\u5920\u5f9e\u4e2d\u5438\u53d6\u6559\u8a13\uff0c\u56de\u6b78\u6b63\u8ecc\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231112091236266089/","title":"NBA's Giannis Antetokounmpo Supports Track and Field Athlete Noah Lyles' World Championship Statement","text":"<p>Giannis Antetokounmpo, also known as \"The Greek Freak,\" recently came to the defense of track and field athlete Noah Lyles after Lyles received criticism for referring to himself as a \"world champion\" in response to NBA players winning championships    NBA's Giannis Antetokounmpo Supports Track and Field Athlete Noah Lyles' World Championship Statement </p> <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo, also known as \"The Greek Freak,\" recently came to the defense of track and field athlete Noah Lyles after Lyles received criticism for referring to himself as a \"world champion\" in response to NBA players winning championships. In a podcast interview, Antetokounmpo expressed his complete agreement with Lyles' point of view and stated that he understood the backlash Lyles faced.</p> <p>Using soccer as an analogy, Antetokounmpo explained that in other sports leagues, such as the UEFA Champions League, teams do not refer to themselves as \"world champions\" even though they may be the best in their league. He also pointed out that while the NBA may be the top basketball league in the world, there are talented players and leagues in other countries that should be respected.</p> <p>At the end of the interview, Antetokounmpo acknowledged that his support for Lyles may also receive criticism, but he stands by his belief that all athletes should be respected and recognized for their accomplishments. Lyles also spoke about the controversy, stating that his intention was not to diminish the achievements of NBA players, but rather to shed light on the lack of attention and recognition given to track and field athletes in the United States. </p>"},{"location":"20231112091240491499/","title":"\u4f46\u9019\u6b21\u516b\u5f37\u8cfd\u7684\u6557\u5317\uff0c\u6216\u8a31\u53ef\u4ee5\u8b93Don\u010di\u0107\u66f4\u653e\u4e0b\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7684\u5305\u88b1\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u4ed6\u7684\u500b\u4eba\u8868\u73fe\u771f\u7684\u5df2\u7d93\u7b97\u662f\u6c92\u8a71\u8aaa\uff0c\u7576\u7136\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6703\u6279\u8a55\u4ed6\u5728\u88c1\u5224\u9762\u524d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u4ed6\u771f\u7684\u5df2\u7d93\u662fNBA\u7403\u661f\uff0c\u4e5f\u771f\u7684\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u4eab\u53d7\u5230\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u76c3\u7b49\u7d1a\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u88e1\u70ba\u81ea\u5df1\u722d\u53d6\u54e8\u97f3\u7684\u6b0a\u5229\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u66f4\u8a72\u5b78\u7fd2\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u60c5\u7dd2\u3001\u66f4\u8a72\u5b78\u7fd2\u5982\u4f55\u5e36\u9818\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u6216\u8a31\u9019\u4e9b\u90fd\u4e0d\u662f\u80fd\u8f15\u6613\u5b78\u6703\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4e00\u5b9a\u66f4\u8a72\u5b78\u7fd2\u5982\u4f55\u63a5\u53d7\u5931\u6557\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u4ed6\u5728NBA\u7684\u7403\u5b63\u88e1\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u5f9eRookie\u5230All-Star\uff0cDon\u010di\u0107\u82e5\u80fd\u5b78\u6703\u63a5\u53d7\u6557\u5317\uff0c\u6216\u8a31\u771f\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u518d\u6b21\u6210\u70ba\u6700\u4f73\u5e74\u8f15\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u6216\u8a31\u4e5f\u5c31\u771f\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u548cShai Gilgeous-Alexander\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u6210\u70ba\u50cfLuka Don\u010di\u0107\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u80fd\u5920\u4e00\u6f32\u4e00\u8dcc\u7684\u540c\u68af\u570b\u969b\u8cfd\u738b\u724c\uff0c\u5f7c\u6b64\u4e92\u76f8\u6fc0\u76ea\u3001\u4e5f\u5f7c\u6b64\u4e92\u76f8\u6210\u9577\u3002","text":"<p>The Iron is as sharp as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Don\u010di\u0107, the two rising stars in international games, clashed in the quarterfinals of the 2023 World Cup    \u4f46\u9019\u6b21\u516b\u5f37\u8cfd\u7684\u6557\u5317\uff0c\u6216\u8a31\u53ef\u4ee5\u8b93Don\u010di\u0107\u66f4\u653e\u4e0b\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7684\u5305\u88b1\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u4ed6\u7684\u500b\u4eba\u8868\u73fe\u771f\u7684\u5df2\u7d93\u7b97\u662f\u6c92\u8a71\u8aaa\uff0c\u7576\u7136\u4e5f\u4e0d\u6703\u6279\u8a55\u4ed6\u5728\u88c1\u5224\u9762\u524d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u4ed6\u771f\u7684\u5df2\u7d93\u662fNBA\u7403\u661f\uff0c\u4e5f\u771f\u7684\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u4eab\u53d7\u5230\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u76c3\u7b49\u7d1a\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u88e1\u70ba\u81ea\u5df1\u722d\u53d6\u54e8\u97f3\u7684\u6b0a\u5229\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u66f4\u8a72\u5b78\u7fd2\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u60c5\u7dd2\u3001\u66f4\u8a72\u5b78\u7fd2\u5982\u4f55\u5e36\u9818\u7403\u968a\uff0c\u6216\u8a31\u9019\u4e9b\u90fd\u4e0d\u662f\u80fd\u8f15\u6613\u5b78\u6703\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4ed6\u4e00\u5b9a\u66f4\u8a72\u5b78\u7fd2\u5982\u4f55\u63a5\u53d7\u5931\u6557\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u4ed6\u5728NBA\u7684\u7403\u5b63\u88e1\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u5f9eRookie\u5230All-Star\uff0cDon\u010di\u0107\u82e5\u80fd\u5b78\u6703\u63a5\u53d7\u6557\u5317\uff0c\u6216\u8a31\u771f\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u518d\u6b21\u6210\u70ba\u6700\u4f73\u5e74\u8f15\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u6216\u8a31\u4e5f\u5c31\u771f\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u548cShai Gilgeous-Alexander\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u6210\u70ba\u50cfLuka Don\u010di\u0107\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u80fd\u5920\u4e00\u6f32\u4e00\u8dcc\u7684\u540c\u68af\u570b\u969b\u8cfd\u738b\u724c\uff0c\u5f7c\u6b64\u4e92\u76f8\u6fc0\u76ea\u3001\u4e5f\u5f7c\u6b64\u4e92\u76f8\u6210\u9577\u3002</p> <p>The Iron is as sharp as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Don\u010di\u0107, the two rising stars in international games, clashed in the quarterfinals of the 2023 World Cup. We hope to use this opportunity to discuss and share various opinions about the game. The final score was 100:89, with Canada winning over Slovenia and advancing to the semifinals for the first time in their history, crushing Slovenia's dream of making it to the top four.</p> <p>The biggest pre-game focus and post-game topic were undoubtedly on Slovenia's top player, Luka Don\u010di\u0107. Before the game, everyone wondered if he, who was predicted to be a candidate for NBA MVP in the new season, could lead his team to achieve their best international result, even potentially winning the championship and achieving a personal milestone. However, after the game, the spotlight was on him being ejected from the game early due to two technical fouls. Don\u010di\u0107 revealed that a referee had told him that he would not get the calls he wanted because of his disrespect towards the referees. This was evident throughout the game, with Don\u010di\u0107 creating contact but not getting the calls, followed by his various expressions of dissatisfaction towards the referees. To be fair, it could be seen that Canada had a slight advantage in terms of calls during the game. Don\u010di\u0107 may have had a reason to complain, but he paid the price for his complaints by receiving technical fouls. Even though his teammates fought with all their might and the final score was only 4 points different when Don\u010di\u0107 was ejected, his absence in the second half of the game was a big blow to Slovenia's comeback efforts.</p> <p>In this case, Don\u010di\u0107 lost both face and substance, while Canada's ace Shai Gilgeous-Alexander emerged as the winner. Not only did he perform well individually, but Canada also won the game and achieved a new milestone in their history. This was the first meeting between the two players on the international stage, and it was a rollercoaster of emotions for both of them, with one rising and the other falling.</p> <p>In 2017, Slovenia made a surprise victory in the EuroBasket, with their point guard Goran Dragi\u0107 winning the MVP award. However, 18-year-old Don\u010di\u0107 was already a rising star who could handle the responsibilities of being the team's leader. It was clear that he was the next basketball prodigy from Europe, after Ricky Rubio, to attract everyone's attention at such a young age. Since then, Don\u010di\u0107 has been shining on the world stage and received significant attention during the 2018 draft. If it weren't for Deandre Ayton, who was the perfect fit for the Phoenix Suns' first overall pick in terms of position and background, Don\u010di\u0107 could have challenged for the top spot. In the end, he was selected as the third pick and joined the Dallas Mavericks through a trade. However, no one could stop Don\u010di\u0107 from shining on all levels of basketball after that. In his rookie year in the NBA, he averaged 21.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 6.0 assists, and in his fifth year, he has already reached a crazy level of \"30-8-8.\" In terms of the world stage, Don\u010di\u0107 has taken over from Dragi\u0107 and become the absolute core of Slovenia, a country that has produced its own basketball system. In this year's World Cup, with top players like Nikola Joki\u0107 of Serbia, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece, and other top American players not participating, Don\u010di\u0107 averaged 26.3 points (the highest in the tournament), 6.8 rebounds, and 6.5 assists, proving that he is worthy of the title of the tournament's top player.</p> <p>There is no doubt about Don\u010di\u0107's performance on the court, and he is rightfully known as the \"golden boy\" since he rose to fame at a young age. The problem is, regardless of whether it's because he has tasted success in the NBA, in recent years, Don\u010di\u0107 has been seen arguing with referees more and more, causing him trouble. In the past three seasons, he has been in the top three in terms of technical fouls in the league and has exceeded the league's limit of 16 technical fouls that result in a suspension. In this quarterfinal game, he was ejected because of two technical fouls, and during the game, Don\u010di\u0107 not only showed his dissatisfaction with gestures, but also made a money-counting gesture towards the referees, implying that they were being bribed and not making fair calls. Even though the referees' calls were not ideal, Don\u010di\u0107's actions were unacceptable and could be considered a stain on his image. Of course, objectively speaking, Slovenia may not have been the most favored team to win the championship. The only reason people had some expectations for them was because of Don\u010di\u0107. With such a superstar, people expected him to create some miracles. However, that was not the case, and Slovenia failed to make it to the top four. In terms of results, it may not be a disappointment, but Don\u010di\u0107's defeat was coupled with his ejection from the game, which may have been just as disappointing. It was similar to what happened in the 2021 NBA playoffs when Joki\u0107, who won MVP that season, was ejected from the game when his team was down 0-3 and watched them getting swept by their opponents.</p> <p>But this loss in the quarterfinals may allow Don\u010di\u0107 to let go of the burden he has been carrying. His individual performance has been outstanding, and he should not be criticized for his behavior towards the referees, as he is already an NBA star and has the right to fight for calls on the world stage. However, he should learn how to control his emotions and how to lead his team. These are not easy things to learn, but he should also learn how to accept defeat, just like he did in his NBA career, from a rookie to an All-Star. If Don\u010di\u0107 can learn to accept defeat, he may once again become the best young player and, like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, become a rising star who can compete on the world stage and grow together.</p>"},{"location":"20231113091131647457/","title":"Asian Games Basketball Final: China to Face Mongolia in Must-Win Game, Coach Sun Maosen Points Out Key Factors","text":"<p>September 28, 2023, 11:14 pm, United Daily News/ Special Correspondent Zeng Siru/ Hangzhou - The Chinese national team's Liu Zheng scores a layup    Asian Games Basketball Final: China to Face Mongolia in Must-Win Game, Coach Sun Maosen Points Out Key Factors</p> <p>September 28, 2023, 11:14 pm, United Daily News/ Special Correspondent Zeng Siru/ Hangzhou - The Chinese national team's Liu Zheng scores a layup. Special correspondent Ji Xiangru/ Photo - In the crucial game for the top spot in the group at the Asian Games men's basketball tournament in Hangzhou, although the Chinese team was able to compete with the host's tall lineup on the inside, their defense on the perimeter faltered as they allowed the Chinese team to score 15 three-pointers, resulting in a final score of 69:89, their first loss of the tournament. In order to secure the second spot in the group, the Chinese team will have to defeat Mongolia in their final group game. Team captain Zeng Wendong declared a \"must-win\" order, and head coach Sun Maosen pointed out the key factors.</p> <p>Sun Maosen mentioned that the Chinese team faced a significant height disadvantage against their opponents today. Throughout the entire game, the Chinese team focused on protecting the paint, but they missed out on many defensive rebounds, allowing the host team to grab offensive rebounds and convert them into outside shots. He added, \"Our biggest problem was that every one of us was being guarded closely on offense, making it difficult to create good opportunities.\" Despite losing by 20 points, Sun Maosen still praised the Chinese team's fighting spirit, but noted that there is room for improvement in their defensive communication and rotations.</p> <p>16 teams are participating in the Asian Games basketball tournament, divided into 4 groups in the preliminary round. The group winners will directly advance to the quarter-finals, while the second and third place teams will compete in a crossover game for the remaining 4 spots in the quarter-finals. The Chinese team will face Mongolia in their final group game, and a win will secure their spot as the second place team in the group.</p> <p>The Chinese team does not have much knowledge about their opponents from Mongolia, but they have studied their previous game against China. Sun Maosen believes that their opponents will be highly energetic and have a positive attitude in the next game. Despite their height disadvantage in today's game, the Chinese team may have an advantage in the next game against Mongolia. In order to have a chance to execute their strong suit of fast break offense, the Chinese team must focus on securing rebounds. Mongolia faced Hong Kong at the same time today and suffered their second consecutive loss with a final score of 64:69, allowing Hong Kong, who is filling in for Lebanon in the Asian Games, to secure their first win. Currently, both China and Hong Kong have a record of 1 win and 1 loss. Based on their strength, it will be difficult for Hong Kong to defeat the host in their final game, which means that the Chinese team, who previously defeated Hong Kong, has a high chance of securing the second spot in the group.</p>"},{"location":"20231113091149016040/","title":"Milwaukee Bucks Post-Game Analysis","text":"<p>The Milwaukee Bucks kicked off their season with a home game against the Philadelphia 76ers    Milwaukee Bucks Post-Game Analysis</p> <p>The Milwaukee Bucks kicked off their season with a home game against the Philadelphia 76ers. Earlier, the 76ers' star player James Harden was supposed to join the team for the game against the Bucks, but due to his absence from team practices and other unexplained absences during the off-season, the team decided not to let him play and left him in Philadelphia.</p> <p>Despite facing a 76ers team without Harden, the Bucks still struggled to pull off a win, relying heavily on Damian Lillard's clutch performance. The team showed strong offensive coordination in the pre-season, but they continued to experiment with different offensive strategies in the regular season.</p> <p>Against a 76ers team led by Joel Embiid, the Bucks chose to push the pace and attack Embiid, a traditional center. Although the team also has traditional big man Brook Lopez, he was mostly used as a weak-side corner shooter or to trail behind for three-point attempts. The pick-and-roll play between the two stars, which was seen frequently in the pre-season, was not as prevalent in this game. Instead, they relied on their individual abilities to break down the 76ers' defense and find open teammates on the perimeter. This was a change from Giannis Antetokounmpo's usual aggressive drives, where he often drew fouls with his powerful moves.</p> <p>Lillard's outside threat was also a key factor in the Bucks' offense. With Lopez staying in the corner for three-point attempts, Embiid was forced to defend outside of the paint. This created more opportunities for the Bucks' young guard, Maxey, to penetrate and find open shooters like Kelly Oubre Jr. on the weak-side. This strategy was effective, but it also left the Bucks vulnerable on the defensive end, especially without Harden to bolster their perimeter defense.</p> <p>Despite the Bucks' strong offensive performance, there are still areas for improvement. The team needs to find a balance between relying on individual talent and utilizing team coordination. In terms of defense, they need to find ways to better defend against elite teams without relying solely on Lillard's heroics. It's clear that the new head coach, Griffin, is giving the players more freedom on offense compared to the previous coach, Mike Budenholzer, who emphasized discipline and shot quality. However, they must also be cautious of falling into the trap of isolation plays and mid-range shots, as seen in Giannis' performance when the team was behind. Griffin quickly made adjustments and put the ball in Lillard's hands, using their strong spacing and ball movement to make a comeback.</p> <p>In summary, the Bucks showed promise in their first game, but they still have areas to improve on both ends of the court. They need to find a way to defend against strong offenses without relying on individual players, and they need to find a balance between individual talent and team coordination on offense. This win is a good start for the Bucks, but it also serves as a reminder that there is still work to be done. Fans can look forward to watching the Bucks continue to improve and bring more exciting games in the future.</p>"},{"location":"20231113091205196739/","title":"Flying Apes' 2223 Season: The Underwhelming Performance of Veteran Sonny","text":"<p>In the third game of the playoffs between the Flying Apes and the Warriors, 40-year-old Lin Chih-Chieh once again showed his dominance on the court    Flying Apes' 2223 Season: The Underwhelming Performance of Veteran Sonny</p> <p>In the third game of the playoffs between the Flying Apes and the Warriors, 40-year-old Lin Chih-Chieh once again showed his dominance on the court. He scored 29 points and led his team to eliminate the Flying Apes in their home court.</p> <p>This performance perfectly showcased the value of a veteran player in the playoffs. However, for the young and inexperienced players on the Flying Apes team, it was too much to expect them to match Lin's level.</p> <p>The team had hoped that their most experienced and intelligent player, Tsakuragi Shinsuke, would display the same veteran presence as Lin did. Unfortunately, throughout the season, we did not see Tsakuragi deliver such performances. In fact, in crucial moments, it was players like Huang Hong-Han and Lu Jun-Xiang who stepped up, while Tsakuragi was nowhere to be found.</p> <p>Compared to the initial expectations when he joined the team, there was a considerable gap in Tsakuragi's performance. When the Flying Apes announced that they had signed Tsakuragi as their next foreign player during the off-season, it was widely praised as a safe and strategic move by the management. After all, Tsakuragi had played in Taiwan before and was familiar with the local style of play. Additionally, he had previously worked with coach Caminos on the T1 League's Taichung Suns, and together they had led the team to the championship series.</p> <p>However, the end result did not live up to these expectations, and it seemed that the chemistry between Tsakuragi and the Flying Apes was not the same as what they had during their time with the Suns.</p> <p>Tsakuragi also seemed unhappy with his role on the team. After the season ended, he posted a cryptic message, suggesting that the Flying Apes' inability to win was due to not playing their best players.</p> <p>While I agree with this statement to some extent, it is not entirely the fault of the coaching staff. Please continue reading to learn more about the team's first half of the season.</p> <p>During the first half of the season, the Flying Apes were known for their ability to perform well in the fourth quarter. This was because they mostly stuck with a single foreign player on the court, allowing the players to have better chemistry and familiarity with each other. However, in the second half of the season, coach Caminos started using a younger lineup, and the team often struggled in the fourth quarter, often losing leads that they had built in the first three quarters.</p> <p>Caminos' decision to use younger players may have been the phenomenon that Tsakuragi mentioned in his post. However, there were reasons behind Caminos' choices. During that time, several key players were in a slump, and even if Tsakuragi had played, it would not have changed the outcome of the game. During the playoffs, Tsakuragi also showed a lack of aggressiveness on offense.</p> <p>Ultimately, it is not easy to fully utilize the value of a veteran player. Furthermore, it seems that Caminos does not rely on the conventional wisdom of experience in crucial moments. Instead, he tends to rely on players who are performing well on that particular day, regardless of their experience. In many crucial moments, we saw Tsakuragi on the bench.</p> <p>It is worth mentioning that Tsakuragi is known for his ability to score in various ways despite his height of only 6-8. He constantly uses fake moves to confuse defenders and has a high basketball IQ. He also has a good mix of inside, mid-range, and three-point shots, making him a threat from anywhere on the court. He also has the strength to finish through contact, making it difficult for defenders to stop him.</p> <p>However, his defensive abilities are not as impressive. It is challenging for him to defend in the paint due to his height, and his wingspan is not exceptional. This makes it difficult for him to protect the rim. On the other hand, when defending against pick-and-rolls, his smaller size can be an advantage.</p> <p>Despite not focusing on defense, the Flying Apes' team defense was still solid with Tsakuragi on the court. During their 10-game winning streak, he also showed good communication and help defense. However, even with his many strengths, Tsakuragi was the foreign player with the least amount of playing time on the Flying Apes. I believe this may be because his role on the court overlaps with that of J. Washburn's. Additionally, his high turnover rate may not be favored by coach Caminos, as the team's slower pace was partly due to their efforts to reduce turnovers. Tsakuragi's style of play requires a significant amount of ball possession, but giving him too much freedom may also be risky, as he also had the highest turnover rate on the team.</p> <p>In conclusion, utilizing the value of a veteran player is not a simple task. I believe that finding a balance in the team's playing style to allow Tsakuragi more opportunities to shine could make the Flying Apes a stronger team. His veteran presence could prove crucial in important games, leading the team to more stable victories.</p>"},{"location":"20231113091224192203/","title":"\u7e3d\u7d50\uff1a","text":"<p>\u96d6\u7136\u56e0\u70ba\u75ab\u60c5\u5ef6\u5f8c\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u4f46\u7070\u72fc\u5728\u71b1\u8eab\u8cfd\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u7684\u6210\u679c\u4ecd\u7136\u8b93\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u6eff\u610f\u3002Finch\u6240\u5f15\u9032\u7684\u65b0\u6230\u8853\uff0c\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u5728\u9032\u653b\u7aef\u66f4\u5177\u7d44\u7e54\u6027\u8207\u591a\u6a23\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u5730\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86KAT\u7684\u6301\u7403\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u8b93\u4ed6\u80fd\u66f4\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u63a5\u61c9\u8207\u6c7a\u7b56\u3002\u800c\u5728\u9632\u5b88\u7aef\uff0cGobert\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u4e5f\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u6574\u9ad4\u9632\u5b88\u6c34\u6e96\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u5728\u878d\u5165\u8207\u8abf\u6574\u4e0a\u505a\u51fa\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u767c\u63ee\u4ed6\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u80fd\u529b\u3002</p> <p>\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u9a5a\u8c54\u7684\u9762\u5411\u5916\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u4ee4\u4eba\u4e0d\u5b89\u7684\u756b\u9762\uff0c\u5982KAT\u5728\u4f4e\u4f4d\u6301\u7403\u6642\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4ee5\u53caGobert\u8207\u539f\u968a\u54e1\u7684\u885d\u7a81\u7b49\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u7070\u72fc\u7684\u6210\u529f\u8207\u5426\uff0c\u4ecd\u8981\u770bKAT\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u51b7\u975c\u8207Finch\u7684\u5f15\u5c0e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caGobert\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u878d\u5165\u8207\u8abf\u6574\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u7b56\u7565\u3002</p> <p>\u7e3d\u7684\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u7070\u72fc\u5728\u71b1\u8eab\u8cfd\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u7684\u6210\u679c\u8b93\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u5c0d\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u5145\u6eff\u671f\u5f85\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u8abf\u6574\u8207\u6311\u6230\u9700\u8981\u9762\u5c0d\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u7403\u968a\u80fd\u5728\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u5c6c\u65bc\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8def\u5f91\uff0c\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5411\u524d\u9081\u9032\u3002   \u7e3d\u7d50\uff1a</p> <p>\u96d6\u7136\u56e0\u70ba\u75ab\u60c5\u5ef6\u5f8c\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u4f46\u7070\u72fc\u5728\u71b1\u8eab\u8cfd\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u7684\u6210\u679c\u4ecd\u7136\u8b93\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u6eff\u610f\u3002Finch\u6240\u5f15\u9032\u7684\u65b0\u6230\u8853\uff0c\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u5728\u9032\u653b\u7aef\u66f4\u5177\u7d44\u7e54\u6027\u8207\u591a\u6a23\u6027\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u5730\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86KAT\u7684\u6301\u7403\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u8b93\u4ed6\u80fd\u66f4\u5c08\u6ce8\u65bc\u63a5\u61c9\u8207\u6c7a\u7b56\u3002\u800c\u5728\u9632\u5b88\u7aef\uff0cGobert\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u4e5f\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u6574\u9ad4\u9632\u5b88\u6c34\u6e96\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8981\u5728\u878d\u5165\u8207\u8abf\u6574\u4e0a\u505a\u51fa\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u767c\u63ee\u4ed6\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u80fd\u529b\u3002</p> <p>\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u9a5a\u8c54\u7684\u9762\u5411\u5916\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u4ee4\u4eba\u4e0d\u5b89\u7684\u756b\u9762\uff0c\u5982KAT\u5728\u4f4e\u4f4d\u6301\u7403\u6642\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4ee5\u53caGobert\u8207\u539f\u968a\u54e1\u7684\u885d\u7a81\u7b49\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u7070\u72fc\u7684\u6210\u529f\u8207\u5426\uff0c\u4ecd\u8981\u770bKAT\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u51b7\u975c\u8207Finch\u7684\u5f15\u5c0e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caGobert\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u878d\u5165\u8207\u8abf\u6574\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u7b56\u7565\u3002</p> <p>\u7e3d\u7684\u4f86\u8aaa\uff0c\u7070\u72fc\u5728\u71b1\u8eab\u8cfd\u4e2d\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u7684\u6210\u679c\u8b93\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u5c0d\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u5145\u6eff\u671f\u5f85\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u8abf\u6574\u8207\u6311\u6230\u9700\u8981\u9762\u5c0d\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u7403\u968a\u80fd\u5728\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u5c6c\u65bc\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8def\u5f91\uff0c\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5411\u524d\u9081\u9032\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231113091230343050/","title":"The 2023 FIBA World Cup for Men's Basketball will kick off on August 25 after various qualifying stages","text":"<p>The 2023 FIBA World Cup for Men's Basketball will kick off on August 25 after various qualifying stages.

One of the teams on the roster is South Korea's Bundang Business High School, known as the \"Empress of South Korean High School Basketball.\" They have not only dominated the high school basketball scene in South Korea, but also played a significant role in the development of professional women's basketball and national team players in recent years. Despite being a relatively new team, Bundang Business High School has risen to become one of the top teams in women's basketball in South Korea.</p> <p>Since its establishment in December 2007, Bundang Business High School has achieved impressive results in various national competitions. In 2010, they won third place in the National Federation of High School Basketball Championship, and in 2011, they won silver at the 92nd National Sports Festival. In the following two years, they swept all major competitions in the high school women's division, and have maintained an unbeaten record in the KSSBF Korean Middle and High School Basketball League for three consecutive years.</p> <p>Bundang Business High School's women's basketball team is aiming for a three-peat at this year's Changyao Cup. (Photo credit: Bundang Business High School)</p> <p>As a rising star in South Korean high school basketball, Bundang Business High School has produced numerous national team players and professional players in the past decade. One of their most well-known players is Park Ji-soo, who has been called the \"strongest center in South Korean history\" and \"genius basketball girl.\" She became the youngest (at 16 years old) women's basketball national team player in South Korean history and was drafted by the Minnesota Lynx as the 5th overall pick in the 2018 WNBA Draft, becoming the second South Korean player to enter the WNBA after Jung Sun-min, who played for the Seattle Storm in 2003. Other players from Bundang Business High School who have made their mark on the international stage include Ban Soo-jung, Ko Na-yeon, and Park Soo-hee, who led the South Korean team to the Round of 16 at the 2021 U19 World Cup. Ban Soo-jung and Park Soo-hee were also drafted as the second and third picks in the WKBL draft last season, earning them the nickname \"monster rookies.\"</p> <p>Park Ji-soo, who came from Bundang Business High School, is currently one of the most promising women's basketball players in South Korea.

Three players from the current team, Seo Yoo-jung, Park Do-youn, and Ban Ha-jeong, have been selected to represent South Korea in the Changyao Cup.

This may also be a barrier that they are determined to overcome in the future. As the world begins to recover from the pandemic, Bundang Business High School is honored to be one of the five international teams invited to participate in the Changyao Cup. The team's coaches stated that this is a significant opportunity for them to not only share and showcase their skills and abilities that have led to multiple championships in South Korea, but also to learn from and gain experience competing against top international teams. They hope that this experience will contribute to the team's development and individual players' future careers. </p> <p>Bundang Business High School's women's basketball team at the 10th Changyao Cup.

This year, the Bulls have only invited three free agents to participate in training camp: forward Quenton Jackson, guard Max Heidegger, and rising star from Estonia, Henri Drell. Quenton is the only one with NBA experience.</p> <p>As we approach the start of training camp, the Bulls currently have 15 players under contract (including non-guaranteed contracts for Terry Taylor and Carlik Jones) and 3 players signed to two-way contracts: Adama Sanogo, Onuralp Bitim, and Justin Lewis.</p> <p>The journey to make the final roster is not an easy one for Quenton and the other two players.</p> <p>6'5\" wing player Quenton Jackson was a undrafted rookie last year, graduating from Texas A&amp;M University. He was signed to a two-way contract with the Wizards and played in 9 games. He was also supposed to play in the summer league for the Wizards, but was released at the end of July.</p> <p>His primary goal with the Bulls should be to compete for a two-way contract, while Justin Lewis will be trying to secure his spot on the roster, making Quenton a potential threat.</p> <p>Max Heidegger, also 6'3\", was an undrafted rookie in 2020, graduating from UC Santa Barbara where he was a key player. He has spent the past three years playing in Europe and participated in the summer league for the Hawks in 2020-21 and 2021-22, but did not make the regular season roster.</p> <p>This will be his first time participating in training camp. Interestingly, Heidegger reportedly signed with Italian team Reyer Venezia on July 22, but a month later, he signed with the Bulls. It is unclear if the previous signing was a mistake.</p> <p>Max will face tougher competition for a two-way or regular contract compared to Quenton, as there are already talented players like Carlik Jones at his position. He may end up playing in the G League or even overseas in Italy.</p> <p>The developments mentioned above have come to fruition. Heidegger and Drell were waived on October 13, while Quenton was released yesterday (October 17).</p> <p>Out of the three players, Quenton got the most playing time and even played in the Bulls' double-overtime win against the Nuggets, coming in midway through the fourth quarter and staying on until the end of the second overtime. Before being waived, Quenton played in all three preseason games, averaging 8.7 minutes, 5 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game. He shot 2-for-3 from the three-point line and had some impressive dunks, such as the one against the Bucks:</p> <p>Quenton Jackson WOW \ud83d\ude33@_flyguyq|@NBCSChicagopic.twitter.com/chbvcPsHuO\u2014 Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls)October 8, 2023</p> <p>And the one that even impressed LaVine:</p> <p>QUENTON JACKSON.@NBCSChicago|@_flyguyqpic.twitter.com/GyWpalZoDh\u2014 Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls)October 13, 2023</p> <p>Despite showing off his athleticism, Quenton was unable to beat out Lewis for a two-way contract, which is a shame for him. As for Heidegger and Drell, they only played in the first preseason game against the Bucks, with Heidegger scoring 1 point from a free throw and Drell not recording any stats. In the early stages of the preseason, Drell had 1 assist and 2 fouls.</p> <p>For more information on Drell, refer to the following articles: [NBA] Chicago Bulls News: Post-Summer League Update on Last Two-Way Contract (Part 2) [NBA] Chicago Bulls News: Post-Summer League Update on Last Two-Way Contract (Part 3)</p> <p>Heidegger and Drell both have the potential to play in Europe. Heidegger had already signed with Reyer Venezia in the Italian league. So even though he signed an Exhibit 10 contract this time, he may not end up in the Bulls' G League team.</p> <p>Drell has played for the Windy City Bulls for two seasons, and his invitation to training camp this year shows that the Bulls' front office has noticed his potential and is giving him another chance to pursue his dream. However, this is just the beginning. After releasing Quenton and the other two players, the Bulls signed former Jazz center Derrick Favors and 22-year-old forward Kahlil Whitney to training camp contracts.</p> <p>OFFICIAL: We have signed center Derrick Favors and forward Kahlil Whitney to camp contracts.pic.twitter.com/1huc9xguiu\u2014 Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls)October 17, 2023</p> <p>Despite being a seasoned veteran, Favors is in need of a platform to showcase his skills. He was the 3rd overall pick in the 2010 draft, but was traded to the Jazz by the Nets before he even finished his rookie season.</p> <p>He spent 10 years with the Jazz and worked his way up from Gobert's backup to his frontcourt partner.</p> <p>Favors is one of the examples of players who struggled to adapt to the small-ball era.</p> <p>He is 6'10\" and weighs 265 pounds, which is a far cry from his days with the Nets when he was known for his lower body strength and explosive performance.</p> <p>However, he is still agile, has good ball-handling skills, and a good passing vision.</p> <p>Moreover, he has played alongside Gobert for a significant amount of time with the Jazz, so he should have some familiarity with the modern big man defense.</p> <p>Favors had some solid seasons with the Jazz, showing his potential.</p> <p>But he was still only a reserve player on a strong Jazz team.</p> <p>By joining the Bulls, he hopes to recreate the same chemistry he had with Gobert.</p> <p>Whitney, on the other hand, was the 3rd overall pick in 2021, selected by the Bucks, then traded to the Rockets, who then traded him to the Bulls.</p> <p>Whitney was also considered for a contract with the Lakers, but was waived during the preseason. He also played for the Greensboro Swarm in the G League.</p> <p>He is 6'6\" and weighs 210 pounds, making him a suitable small forward, but he is actually more of a wing player.</p> <p>His height is average for a wing player, but his weight is on the lighter side, which is his biggest obstacle in the NBA.</p> <p>Whitney and Favors both have good ball-handling skills and are agile, but their light weight is a disadvantage, and they are not shooters, which makes it difficult for them to find a spot in the modern NBA.</p> <p>Whitney will most likely stay in the G League, while Favors will be a key player for the Bulls.</p> <p>This also shows that the Bulls' frontcourt is relatively weak.</p> <p>Although they have an All-Star caliber player in LaVine, the rest of the frontcourt is barren.</p> <p>Although LaVine can play as a small forward on offense, his height is a disadvantage on defense, so he can only play as a wing player at best.</p> <p>Favors can play as a small forward, but his height is also a disadvantage, so he can only play as a wing player at best.</p> <p>The starting forward positions are taken by Vucevic and Troy Brown Jr., both of whom are big men.</p> <p>LaVine and Favors will be the only wing players.</p> <p>This configuration is an improvement from last year.</p> <p>Last year, the Bulls' lineup was like this: two big men and two LaVines.</p> <p>Last year's LaVine was still missing someone else.</p> <p>The Bulls' frontcourt is not held together by LaVine's offensive abilities, but by Vucevic's defensive abilities. Vucevic's height disadvantage is actually an advantage on defense.</p> <p>Favors has joined the Bulls to fill this position.</p> <p>Whitney will most likely stay in the G League.</p> <p>After all, he is undersized and not a shooter.</p> <p>So his playing time in the NBA will be limited.</p> <p>We hope he can find his place in the G League.</p>"},{"location":"20231114091129189150/","title":"The NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers have strengthened their front line with the addition of free agent Christian Wood","text":"<p>The NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers have strengthened their front line with the addition of free agent Christian Wood.

Despite a strong performance from the Bulls, led by Ben Simmons, the Nets were able to narrowly defeat them due to their versatility and lack of size in the paint.</p> <p>In this game, the Nets only committed 8 turnovers, the first time this season that an opponent has had fewer turnovers than the Bulls. This highlights the importance of forcing turnovers in order to create scoring opportunities, as even with a decent three-point shooting percentage, the Bulls were unable to secure the win.</p> <p>One positive takeaway from this game was the lineup of Craig, Williams, Coby White, Nikola Vucevic, and Zach LaVine, which proved to be effective and worth exploring in future games. However, it also revealed the need for a third big man to come off the bench and provide support.</p> <p>In terms of individual performances, DeMar DeRozan struggled with a -16 plus/minus rating, while the Nets were able to effectively contain him. On the other hand, the bench players for the Bulls had a strong showing, indicating the need for better integration with the starting lineup.</p> <p>A key moment in the game was when LaVine gambled on a defensive play, leaving Mikal Bridges open for a dunk. This highlights LaVine's tendency to take risks on defense, an area that he can improve on.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the Bulls will face the Dallas Mavericks in their next game, an important matchup against a division rival. In order to secure the win, the Bulls will need to improve on defense, particularly in rebounding and forcing turnovers. </p>"},{"location":"20231114091138760121/","title":"\u660e\u5929\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u5c07\u6703\u662f\u96d9\u65b9\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u4ea4\u624b\uff0c\u4e0a\u6b21\u706b\u7bad\u4ee5112\u6bd4108\u64ca\u6557\u6e56\u4eba\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dBrooks\u5c31\u8ca2\u737b\u4e8626\u5206\uff0c\u800cLeBron\u5247\u670927\u5206\u30018\u7c43\u677f\u30017\u52a9\u653b\u7684\u6210\u7e3e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u660e\u5929\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u5c07\u6703\u662f\u5169\u4f4d\u7403\u661f\u7684\u518d\u6b21\u5c0d\u6c7a\uff0c\u4e5f\u8b93\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u66f4\u52a0\u671f\u5f85\u9019\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u5e0c\u671bBrooks\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u660e\u5929\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u7e7c\u7e8c\u4fdd\u6301\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u8b93\u706b\u7bad\u80fd\u5920\u53d6\u5f97\u56db\u9023\u52dd\uff0c\u800cLeBron\u4e5f\u80fd\u5920\u5ef6\u7e8c\u4ed6\u7684\u7a69\u5b9a\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u5e36\u9818\u6e56\u4eba\u968a\u91cd\u56de\u52dd\u5229\u7684\u8ecc\u9053\u3002\u5169\u4f4d\u7403\u661f\u7684\u5c0d\u6c7a\u5c07\u6703\u662f\u660e\u5929\u6bd4\u8cfd\u7684\u6700\u5927\u770b\u9ede\uff0c\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u62ed\u76ee\u4ee5\u5f85\u3002","text":"<p>Tomorrow, the NBA will have a total of 14 games as there was no game today due to the US election   \u660e\u5929\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u5c07\u6703\u662f\u96d9\u65b9\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u4ea4\u624b\uff0c\u4e0a\u6b21\u706b\u7bad\u4ee5112\u6bd4108\u64ca\u6557\u6e56\u4eba\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dBrooks\u5c31\u8ca2\u737b\u4e8626\u5206\uff0c\u800cLeBron\u5247\u670927\u5206\u30018\u7c43\u677f\u30017\u52a9\u653b\u7684\u6210\u7e3e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u660e\u5929\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u5c07\u6703\u662f\u5169\u4f4d\u7403\u661f\u7684\u518d\u6b21\u5c0d\u6c7a\uff0c\u4e5f\u8b93\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u66f4\u52a0\u671f\u5f85\u9019\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u7684\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u5e0c\u671bBrooks\u80fd\u5920\u5728\u660e\u5929\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u7e7c\u7e8c\u4fdd\u6301\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u8b93\u706b\u7bad\u80fd\u5920\u53d6\u5f97\u56db\u9023\u52dd\uff0c\u800cLeBron\u4e5f\u80fd\u5920\u5ef6\u7e8c\u4ed6\u7684\u7a69\u5b9a\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u5e36\u9818\u6e56\u4eba\u968a\u91cd\u56de\u52dd\u5229\u7684\u8ecc\u9053\u3002\u5169\u4f4d\u7403\u661f\u7684\u5c0d\u6c7a\u5c07\u6703\u662f\u660e\u5929\u6bd4\u8cfd\u7684\u6700\u5927\u770b\u9ede\uff0c\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u62ed\u76ee\u4ee5\u5f85\u3002 </p> <p>Tomorrow, the NBA will have a total of 14 games as there was no game today due to the US election.

Photo/FIBA World Cup On the second day of the quarter-finals of the FIBA World Cup, undefeated Germany faced the dark horse of this year's tournament, Latvia. German star Franz Wagner returned to the court after missing four consecutive games. Despite a poor performance from Dennis Schroder, who only made 4 of 26 shots, Germany managed to secure a narrow 81-79 victory, thanks to a comfortable lead in the first half and a missed three-point shot by Davis Bertans in the final seconds. They will face USA in the semi-finals on Friday.</p> <p>In the first quarter, Latvia was the stronger team, taking advantage of Germany's struggling offense and building a 13-3 lead with three three-pointers from Davis Bertans. However, Germany, being the undefeated team, quickly adjusted their defensive strategy and started to score through Voigtmann and Franz Wagner's three-pointers. Maodo Lo and Andreas Obst also stepped up to stabilize Germany's offense, as Schroder had a poor first half (0-9 shooting). Germany led by a slim margin of 36-34 at halftime. Both teams' offense picked up in the third quarter, with Schroder finally making his first shot on the 13th attempt and Franz Wagner being more decisive in his plays. Latvia relied on guard Arturs Zagars to initiate their offense, connecting on outside shots and driving to the basket. Bertans continued to be hot from beyond the arc, making two more three-pointers in this quarter.</p> <p>In the final quarter, Germany decided to rest Schroder and increase their height advantage by having Franz Wagner play as point guard. This proved to be effective as they opened the quarter with an 8-0 run, widening the lead to 11 points. In the middle of the fourth quarter, Latvia made two three-pointers to narrow the gap, while Schroder, who only made 2 of 20 shots, finally scored on a drive. The score was down to 10 points. In the last two minutes, Rodions Kurucs made a three-pointer, and Bertans successfully blocked a shot, followed by Zagars making two difficult layups to score 6 points in a row, bringing the deficit to only 2 points. In the final seconds, Germany's Daniel Theis made two free throws, and Schroder's last drive was blocked. Bertans had a chance to tie the game with a three-pointer, but it missed, and Germany held on to an 81-79 victory, securing their spot in the semi-finals against USA on Friday.</p> <p>Germany's main point guard Dennis Schroder had a poor performance in this game, with 9 points, 4 assists, 4 turnovers, and 2 steals on 4 of 26 shooting. He also had the worst +/- value of -20, almost dragging down Germany's offense. Fortunately, their lead in the first half was enough to prevent a comeback by Latvia. Franz Wagner, who returned from injury, had a typical performance with 16 points, 8 rebounds, and 3 assists, with a high +/- value of +19. He and his brother Moritz Wagner helped save Germany from defeat, with Moritz scoring 12 points and 4 rebounds.</p> <p>Latvia's journey in the World Cup ends in the quarter-finals, but their team's fighting spirit was impressive. Arturs Zagars had 24 points and 8 assists, making several crucial left-handed layups to keep the game close. Davis Bertans made six three-pointers, making him a key player for Latvia's chances of winning. They will face Italy in their next game, continuing to fight for the best possible finish in the tournament.</p>"},{"location":"20231114091154766639/","title":"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Discusses Players' Trade Requests: \"It's Not a Secret Anymore, But Issues Should Be Resolved Behind Closed Doors\"","text":"<p>Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, recently appeared on ESPN's \"First Take\" and discussed the potential division realignment for the 2024 All-Star Game and the issue of players resting during the season   NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Discusses Players' Trade Requests: \"It's Not a Secret Anymore, But Issues Should Be Resolved Behind Closed Doors\"</p> <p>Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, recently appeared on ESPN's \"First Take\" and discussed the potential division realignment for the 2024 All-Star Game and the issue of players resting during the season.

preparation for the new season of East Asia Super League (EASL), New Taipei King announced on September 22nd that they have signed Asian import player Hayden Blankley. The 23-year-old rookie from Bay Area Dragons, who joined the professional league in 2022, will join the team to challenge PBA league and showcase his skills in the upcoming season. Born in New South Wales, Australia, Hayden stands at 198cm and played college basketball for NCAA Division II team West Texas A&amp;M University. In 2022, he joined Bay Area Dragons in Hong Kong and played in 24 games, averaging 13.4 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game with a 40.3% three-point shooting percentage. He also had an impressive performance of 47 points with 10 three-pointers made in a single game, helping Bay Area Dragons to reach the runner-up position in that season. In the previous EASL season, Hayden played in 3 games, contributing 9.7 points, 4 rebounds, and shooting 53% from beyond the arc. His excellent physical condition and shooting ability caught the attention of Australian NBL1 team Bendigo Braves, where he currently plays with an average of 21.9 points and 10.8 rebounds per game. His outstanding shooting skills and flexibility in off-ball movements will be an advantage for Hayden in his professional career. </p> <p>After joining New Taipei King, Hayden will compete in 6 group stage games in EASL, aiming to help the team advance to the top 4 and achieve better results. General Manager Mao Jiaen said, \"We noticed Hayden's playing style when he challenged PBA last year and it fits our team's defense strategy very well. With his height and versatility, he can cover positions 2, 3, and even play as a substitute for position 4. He is a team player and doesn't dominate the ball, which will greatly benefit our team in creating offensive space. With many experienced guards on our team, we believe Hayden will be a strong weapon for New Taipei King in the EASL.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231114091304743750/","title":"\u6839\u64da\u6d88\u606f\uff0cKorkmaz\u7684\u8acb\u6c42\u88ab\u96d9\u65b9\u7403\u968a\u62d2\u7d55\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u4ed6\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u6c92\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u7121\u6cd5\u6210\u70ba\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u7c4c\u78bc\u3002\u96d6\u7136\u4ed6\u6709\u8457\u4e0d\u932f\u7684\u5916\u7dda\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6216\u8a31\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\uff0cKorkmaz\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8868\u73fe\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u50f9\u503c\u3002","text":"<p>\u5728\u9019\u6b21\u7684Harden\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e03\u516d\u4eba\u6700\u7d42\u9001\u51faDante

Spotlight</p> <p>The Toronto Raptors defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 97-94 in a tightly contested game. Despite losing by only three points, the Timberwolves' poor performance was evident.</p> <p>Source: Times Union</p> <p>Key stats:</p> <p>Fast break points: 12-34</p> <p>3-point field goal percentage: 25.8%-40%</p> <p>Ant+KAT's combined shot attempts: 52%</p> <p>The Good:</p> <p>Despite the overall lackluster performance, the Timberwolves' healthy three-time DPOY is still a valuable asset. Source: Clayton News Daily</p> <p>Although most of the team's performance was subpar, after the first explosive play, the Timberwolves immediately focused on rebounding with Gobert as their core. They only allowed the Raptors to grab 8 offensive rebounds throughout the game, which is commendable considering the team's improved physical condition.</p> <p>The team's poor plus-minus can be attributed to the chaotic offensive system. The fast breaks after steals were also comical, but the team's awareness of creating space on both ends of the court and protecting the rim, allowed the Raptors, who are not known for their 3-point shooting, to attempt more 3-pointers with favorable results. It is unimaginable how this team would fare without Conley leading the reins, and it would likely be a one-on-one hell.</p> <p>In the middle of the third quarter, after a timeout, the ball was given to the veteran coach. The familiar horn and pick-and-roll tactics from the preseason began to work, leading to a smoother and more harmonious ball movement. How to manage ball possession and energy throughout the long season will be a challenge for Finch.</p> <p>The Bad:</p> <p>KAT's impatience and poor decision-making disappointed all the fans who expected him to continue his preseason performance.</p> <p>Although Ant scored 12 points with a 60% field goal percentage in the first quarter, his tendency to overdribble and take tough shots was already showing.</p> <p>Especially when the rest of the team's 3-point shooting was not working, instead of trying to integrate into the team's tactics and take easier shots, Ant would often just dribble past half-court and go for a solo drive, making it difficult for his four teammates to even touch the ball. With more turnovers than assists and constantly attacking the rim in triple coverage, it was the familiar Ant that fans know, but as the team's star player, he must learn when to take the right shots.</p> <p>The same can be said for KAT, who needs to make quicker decisions, but against the Raptors' tall and aggressive defense, his recently activated brain seems to have slowed down. His hesitation before making a move resulted in a poor 32% field goal percentage, at least three missed 3-pointers, and awkward plays where he purposely tried to connect with Gobert even though Poeltl was retreating.</p> <p>Including the disastrous turnover in the last possession, it is clear that KAT was playing with frustration. If not for his opportunity to dominate Siakam in the post, his stats would have been even more dreadful. The chaotic performances of the two star players disrupted the team's offensive strategy that they tried in the preseason. Although a portion of the team's poor first-half offensive efficiency can be attributed to NAW's unusual shooting slump and the Raptors' excellent perimeter defense, the rest of the Timberwolves players, except for Conley, seemed to have forgotten about the team's system and only relied on their hustle.</p> <p>This led to more transition opportunities for the calm and collected Raptors, while the Timberwolves' two big men were left watching as Siakam and Barnes attacked their smaller defenders with their size.</p> <p>Shake Milton is still trying to find his rhythm, and his lost defensive assignments and seemingly aimless play were already evident in the preseason. However, as a new member of the team and not known for his defense, he should not be blamed too harshly. NAW's shot selection was correct, but the Raptors' constant switching and drop defense strategy made it difficult for him to replicate his World Cup performance.</p> <p>The Future:</p> <p>After the Timberwolves finished the preseason with the league's best assist numbers, Chris Finch mentioned in a media interview: \"Don't overanalyze it; we'll see if it works when the spotlight is on.\"</p> <p>However, compared to the Raptors, who also had an impressive preseason, the Timberwolves' performance was a major warning sign.</p> <p>It is not necessarily a bad thing to realize your weaknesses early on in an away game, especially since the team is still missing Jaden McDaniels in the frontcourt. Hopefully, before facing the Heat, another defensive powerhouse, at home, the Wolves can regain their focus from the preseason.</p> <p>It is also worth noting how the Timberwolves will finish the game with what lineup. The SloMo-KAT-Gobert lineup puts too much pressure on the ball handler, and SloMo's role as a secondary playmaker is not a replacement for KAT's decision-making. Will Finch give up the two big men in crucial moments and let Slo-Mo play the power forward position? This will be something to pay attention to in future games. </p>"},{"location":"20231115091153645773/","title":"Slow Start: The Four Problems with the Knicks' Slow Offensive Attack","text":"<p>In modern basketball, especially in today's NBA style of play, shooting ability is crucial    Slow Start: The Four Problems with the Knicks' Slow Offensive Attack </p> <p>In modern basketball, especially in today's NBA style of play, shooting ability is crucial. If a team has accurate outside shooting, it means high offensive efficiency and the ability to stretch the floor for more plays. On the other hand, if their outside shooting is off, the offensive efficiency naturally suffers.</p> <p>However, the Knicks defied this norm last season, ranking only 20th in true shooting percentage, but still holding the 4th spot in offensive efficiency in the league.</p> <p>In the past 27 years, only the 2021-22 Grizzlies were able to maintain a top-five offensive level when ranking in the bottom half in one of the four key offensive stats (effective field goal percentage, offensive rebound rate, free throw rate, turnover rate). Keep reading to find out how the Knicks were able to achieve such results, with top-ten rankings in the other three factors, especially in controlling turnovers (ranked 5th) and grabbing offensive rebounds (ranked 2nd).</p> <ol> <li>Significant Drop in Efficiency </li> </ol> <p>However, the Knicks' current record of 4 wins and 4 losses shows a decrease of 9 points per 100 possessions compared to last season, the most drastic decrease in offensive efficiency in the entire league.</p> <p>In their first five games of the season, the Knicks faced four teams that ranked in the top six in defensive performance last season \u2013 the Cavaliers (1), Celtics (2), and Pelicans (6). Despite this tough schedule, other teams like the Trail Blazers and Grizzlies also faced challenges with key players leaving or being absent, but the Knicks have been leading the league in team stability since last year with only Obi Toppin leaving the team.</p> <p>In addition, the Knicks have had good health throughout the team, with only RJ Barrett missing one game due to injury (against the Cavaliers). Keep reading for the second problem.</p> <ol> <li>Same Strengths, Same Weaknesses </li> </ol> <p>In terms of offensive rebounding, the Knicks continue to excel in their strengths, ranking 2nd in offensive rebound rate, with Mitchell Robinson still dominating in offensive rebounds. It can be imagined that Evan Mobley must be relieved to not have to face Robinson for the next four months.</p> <ol> <li>Lack of Finishing Ability in the Paint </li> </ol> <p>Although Robinson does not take many shots, his drop in shooting efficiency ranks 2nd among the Knicks' rotational players, from 67.1% to 48.0%.</p> <p>This problem is more about how to finish scoring, rather than just shooting skills. Keep reading for the third problem. </p> <p>The top two players on the Knicks in terms of shots in the paint, Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle, have a combined field goal percentage of less than 40%, a significant decrease from last season's 56.7%.</p> <p>Photo Source: Getty Images</p> <ol> <li>Lack of Ball Movement </li> </ol> <p>As mentioned earlier, the season has just begun and the Knicks have only played 8 out of 82 games.</p> <p>As time goes by, star-level players like Brunson and Randle will surely gradually improve, but the Knicks will continue to face the same issue of lack of ball movement. The Knicks rank 26th in passing flow and only make 299 passes per 24 minutes of possession time, with a distance of 11.1 miles traveled per 24 minutes, making them one of the five teams at the bottom of both rankings.</p> <p>However, this has not changed much from last season, when the Knicks ranked 25th and 20th, respectively.</p> <p>Ball movement does not necessarily correlate with offensive efficiency. In fact, some teams ranked lower than the Knicks, including the Celtics, Mavericks, and Clippers, currently have top-tier offensive efficiency in the league.</p> <p>These teams have star players like Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, Luka Doncic, Paul George, and Kawhi Leonard.</p> <p>The Knicks have Brunson and Randle, but their efficiency in isolation has significantly decreased compared to last season. In theory, their isolation abilities should create more scoring opportunities for their teammates (including each other), but sometimes when they have an advantage (such as attracting two defenders), the ball does not continue to move after one pass, or Brunson and Randle still take many difficult shots even when their teammates are open. The positive performances of the Knicks' players on the court are still not enough, although they still use their strengths in games, including Brunson's driving and agility, Randle's aggressive style, and Robinson's rebounding advantage. But if the Knicks can use this as a foundation and incorporate more flexible passing while avoiding too many difficult shots, they are fully capable of making the game smoother. Especially with the Knicks' star isolation abilities and passing abilities, if they have the willingness and effort to share the ball, it will definitely improve their team's offense. On the defensive end, the Knicks are also performing well, ranking 2nd in team defensive efficiency and controlling rebounds. This has led to their opponents only scoring 100 points per 100 possessions, the second-lowest in the league.</p> <p>The Knicks have a young and energetic lineup, and their offensive potential is still great. However, if they want to become a truly strong team, they need to continue to improve their offensive problems, especially in ball movement and efficiency. If they can maintain their excellent defensive performance, the Knicks will be an awe-inspiring team.</p>"},{"location":"20231115091212801034/","title":"NBA: James Harden absent from training again, Embiid says he may have something to do","text":"<p>Photo/Reuters Today, according to renowned journalist Shams Charania, sources revealed that 76ers player James Harden was absent from training today    NBA: James Harden absent from training again, Embiid says he may have something to do</p> <p>Photo/Reuters Today, according to renowned journalist Shams Charania, sources revealed that 76ers player James Harden was absent from training today.</p> <p>In addition, Harden has not been with the team since Monday (Taipei time).

The most talked-about trade this summer was completed early this morning, sending Damian Lillard to the Bucks to team up with Giannis Antetokounmpo in the Eastern Conference. American journalist Jake Fischer also gave his insight on why the Bucks wanted to acquire Lillard and the potential developments for Jrue Holiday after this trade.</p> <p>According to Fischer, one of the reasons why the Bucks chose to pursue Lillard this summer was because of the public statements made by Giannis about not signing a contract extension with the Bucks \"right now.\" He stated that he wants to wait until next summer to make a decision, but he hasn't made up his mind yet. Giannis said, \"If I didn't have the desire to compete for a championship, sacrifice time away from my family, then I wouldn't be the best version of myself. If my teammates didn't make me feel that way, I wouldn't have signed an extension.\" Fischer also mentioned Holiday's potential move to the Trail Blazers and said that the Heat, 76ers, and Clippers are all interested in acquiring him. Regarding the Heat, Fischer stated that although they didn't have many conversations with the Trail Blazers about Lillard, it doesn't mean they can't make an offer for Holiday. He also mentioned that this trade has sparked discussions among front offices, and the Heat have been interested in Holiday since his time with the Pelicans.</p> <p>The 76ers and Clippers are also interested in Holiday due to the James Harden trade talks. The 76ers are not satisfied with the package the Clippers offered for Harden (they don't want to include Terance Mann), so they are looking at Holiday as a potential alternative to complete a three-team trade. However, the Clippers are not solely focused on Harden and would be willing to give up their pursuit of him if they can acquire Holiday. As for the Celtics, according to Boston Globe reporter Adam Himmselsbach, they are also interested in trading for Holiday, but they would likely have to include Malcolm Brogdon in the deal. However, their current salary cap situation and Brogdon's injury may pose a problem for the Celtics. The Trail Blazers, after acquiring Holiday, may look to trade him again for more assets as his presence could affect the playing time of the three guards they are trying to develop.</p>"},{"location":"20231115091226359037/","title":"The CBL championship game took place at the home court of National Taiwan Normal University, where they invited alumnus Huang Wanlong and singer Guo Jing to show their support","text":"<p>The CBL championship game took place at the home court of National Taiwan Normal University, where they invited alumnus Huang Wanlong and singer Guo Jing to show their support.</p> <p>After a month of CBL college basketball games, the final championship game of this week officially began with National Taiwan Normal University hosting National Chengchi University.

It is estimated that 48 players will be affected by this policy and will not be allowed to miss regular season games without a valid reason. In the previous report, it was mentioned that there are five main directions of the NBA rest policy: in addition to the previous restriction on multiple star players on the same team resting at the same time, the NBA also requires that players without obvious injuries cannot miss important games (such as mid-season invitation tournaments and national broadcasts), and personal awards have a restriction of playing at least 65 games to be eligible for selection.</p> <p>According to the list of players compiled by ESPN reporter Bobby Marks, the definition of players on the list is that they have been selected for the All-Star Game and All-NBA team in the past three years.</p> <p>It is expected that 48 players will be affected by this policy, including: In addition, according to Marks' news, if you are selected as an All-Star player in the middle of the season, regardless of whether you are selected for the first time or after a gap of three years, you will also be listed.</p> <p>As an example, Marks mentioned Tyrese Maxey of the 76ers. If he is selected for the All-Star Game for the first time in February next year, he will be included in this list after the All-Star Game and will also be subject to the rest clause in future games. As for popular rookie Victor Wembanyama, whether he will be subject to the rest clause, Marks' answer is no. He has no record of playing in the NBA in the past and will not be on this list unless he is selected for the All-Star Game in his rookie season. Marks also mentioned that there is no restriction on playing at least 65 games for being selected as the Rookie of the Year or First Team, Second Team.</p>"},{"location":"20231115091251418695/","title":"Klay Thompson was asked why he didn't fold any paper airplanes after the game","text":"<p>Klay Thompson was asked why he didn't fold any paper airplanes after the game. \"I played terribly, didn't deserve to fold any,\" he responded.

With only Chet Holmgren and two-way player Olivier Sarr left as centers, the team had to face the opening games of the season. However, the Thunder performed well in the first week of the season, defeating the Chicago Bulls on the road and then the Cleveland Cavaliers in a comeback win with an 18-5 run in the last 2 minutes and 40 seconds.</p> <p>In their home opener, they faced the defending champions Denver Nuggets and suffered a 33-point loss. However, they quickly bounced back and defeated the Detroit Pistons the next day, ending the week with a 3-1 record.</p> <p>In the first game against the Bulls, both teams had a close battle in the first three quarters, with the Bulls trailing by only one point with 3 minutes left in the third quarter. However, the Thunder's guards were able to break through the Bulls' defense and hit a series of three-pointers in the fourth quarter, securing the opening game victory.</p> <p>In the next game against the Cavaliers, who were missing Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen, the Thunder faced a tough defensive battle. Both teams had strong defenders inside and outside, resulting in a low-scoring game. Donovan Mitchell of the Cavaliers tried to attack the Thunder's defense by using screens, but the Thunder's defense held strong, with Luguentz Dort and Chet Holmgren making key plays to secure the win.</p> <p>After two consecutive wins on the road, the Thunder returned home to face the Denver Nuggets, but unfortunately suffered a big defeat with poor shooting from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the team's perimeter players. However, they quickly regrouped and defeated the Detroit Pistons the next day with strong defense from Dort and Holmgren, limiting the impact of Cade Cunningham and Jalen Duren. This was also the only game where Holmgren played all three quarters.</p> <p>Despite the injuries and setbacks, the Thunder's young players showed great potential and growth in the first week of the season. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, known for his strong performances on the road, led the team with an average of 65 points, 16 rebounds, and 6 steals in the first two games. He also showcased improved passing skills, making beautiful skip passes to open teammates. However, he will need to work on his free throw shooting, with only 11 attempts in the first three games.</p> <p>As for Chet Holmgren, despite a tough first game against Nikola Vucevic and Andre Drummond, he quickly proved himself to be a perfect fit for the Thunder's system with his defense and offensive versatility. He also helped create open looks for his teammates and was a force inside the paint. Despite not having the same level of physicality as other centers, Holmgren's length and defensive awareness allowed him to block shots and rank in the top five in the league in defensive efficiency.</p> <p>Although the Thunder had a lot of injuries to start the season, the return of Jaylin Williams and Kenrich Williams, as well as the improvement of Olivier Sarr, have strengthened the team's frontcourt. And with the young players' growth and potential, the Thunder have a bright future ahead. Despite the challenges, we believe that the Thunder will continue to improve and achieve more victories this season.</p>"},{"location":"20231116091144456125/","title":"2023 TGF Firefighting World Cup Basketball Tournament Player Interview - Shengsheng Firefighting U Chen Hao and Wang Zhonghan","text":"<p>In the past two years, the key figures in Jianguo High School's consecutive victories in the second division were none other than Wang Zhonghan and Chen Hao   2023 TGF Firefighting World Cup Basketball Tournament Player Interview - Shengsheng Firefighting U Chen Hao and Wang Zhonghan</p> <p>In the past two years, the key figures in Jianguo High School's consecutive victories in the second division were none other than Wang Zhonghan and Chen Hao. The two have been teammates for nearly ten years, from Sanxing Elementary School, Yongji Junior High School, to Jianguo High School. Their bond and understanding are as strong as blood. Now, they are about to officially go their separate ways in college. There may be some reluctance, but in the last summer of high school, they joined Shengsheng Firefighting and ultimately won the championship in the Central Region and the final. Not only did they win the league, but they also won the gold medal for Shengsheng Firefighting for two consecutive years, marking a perfect ending to their high school career.</p> <p>Please continue reading - After winning the league two consecutive times this year, Chen Hao said: \"Last year, I mainly played off the ball, but as a senior this year, I have to take on more responsibility. Actually, I didn't think about winning the championship at first, so there wasn't much pressure on us. It's possible that because we had no fear, we performed better. As for setbacks, it was dealing with the busy schedule of applying for college. I had very little time to practice, and my physical fitness is my weakness, so I have to adjust during the game.\"</p> <p>Please continue reading - When they joined Shengsheng Firefighting, they said: \"Being part of this big family, we feel very relaxed. Plus, our teammates are all talented players from different schools, so it's refreshing to mesh with them. It's more like a exchange than a competition.\"</p> <p>Facing the decision of which university to attend, Wang Zhonghan said: \"I have always planned to study abroad, and I chose a university in Germany because most of them don't have tuition fees, so the cost won't be too high compared to Taiwan. Technical University of Munich is also considered the best university in Germany, so I decided to major in Management &amp; Technology.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chen Hao chose to study at Tsinghua University without specifying a major. He said: \"By chance, I discovered this major at Tsinghua University. It can satisfy my desire to explore various fields in my freshman year, and I can choose a major that I'm interested in for my future studies. It's suitable for someone like me who's still unsure about what to choose.\"</p> <p>After the TGF Firefighting World Cup ended, the two will embark on a new journey. They also hope their younger teammates will play freely, give their all, and aim for the ultimate goal without any regrets. Lastly, they send warm and playful wishes to each other, not saying goodbye, but until we meet again. They wish the two players all the best in their respective fields and hope to see them again in next year's TGF Firefighting World Cup.</p>"},{"location":"20231116091152359925/","title":"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver recently appeared on ESPN's \"First Take\" and discussed the possibility of changing the format of the 2024 All-Star Game to East vs","text":"<p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver recently appeared on ESPN's \"First Take\" and discussed the possibility of changing the format of the 2024 All-Star Game to East vs. West divisions, as well as player rest issues.

In 1996, Coach Qiu Guoda took over as the head coach of the Mingren Junior High School boys' basketball team in Miaoli. From the beginning until now, he has been steadfast for nearly 30 years. He has never forgotten his original intention to focus on educating and nurturing students, regardless of fame and fortune.</p> <p>Growing up as a player from a young age, Coach Qiu devoted himself to coaching after his student days. Looking back now, he admits that he never thought he would stay in this position for decades. In these long and ever-changing years, it is easy to see the changes in the basketball environment at home and abroad. The only constant is his dedication to grassroots basketball. Many outstanding players in Taiwan's basketball scene, such as CBA top pick Chen Yingjun, have been nurtured by him. The Mingren Junior High School basketball team has also achieved remarkable results in the JBHL tournament.</p> <p>Coach Qiu Guoda has been cultivating grassroots basketball at Mingren Junior High School for nearly 30 years. (Photo source: Mingren Junior High School basketball team) Coach Qiu believes that in addition to focusing on basketball skills, grassroots basketball education should also prioritize players' character development and academic pursuits. \"A tree with deep roots will not be easily toppled by the wind.\" Having a good foundation during student years is crucial for future success. Moreover, Coach Qiu has been quietly helping underprivileged students, demonstrating the true meaning of education that knows no social class. </p> <p>\"Grassroots basketball education requires both hardware and software. Hardware includes venues, training environments, and funding sources, which can vary depending on geographical location and create urban-rural gaps. It is important for coaches promoting grassroots basketball to close this gap.</p> <p>As for the software, it involves consistent teaching materials and curriculum. A complete and seamless connection from beginners to professionals can have a positive impact.\" Japan's progress in the past decade is evident to all. Coach Qiu believes that as an East Asian country, if Japan can do it, then Taiwan can do it too. At the opening ceremony of the 10th Changyao Cup, Coach Qiu Guoda was awarded the \"Best Contribution Award.\" (Photo source: Changyao Cup) \"The Changyao Cup has been running for ten years now and has grown in scale and improved in quality, from high school to university, from domestic to international, providing substantial help to many. \"At the 10th Changyao Cup, Chairman Xie Jianguo presented me with this award.

He hopes to encourage and share with more people who are also dedicated to grassroots basketball, and to grow and thrive together.</p> <p>Grassroots education is a journey without a clear end, a long road that may not have a clear destination, but we can feel the beauty of the changes along the way.</p>"},{"location":"20231116091223048729/","title":"Summary of Minnesota Timberwolves' delayed preseason after one year","text":"<p>After a busy offseason, the Minnesota Timberwolves ended their ten-year undefeated preseason with a successful performance, both on paper and on the court    Summary of Minnesota Timberwolves' delayed preseason after one year</p> <p>After a busy offseason, the Minnesota Timberwolves ended their ten-year undefeated preseason with a successful performance, both on paper and on the court.</p> <p>Despite the salary cap concerns caused by Jaden McDaniels' $136 million contract, the team's main focus is still on solving the issue of having two dominant players on the court.</p> <p>Coach Chris Finch has repeatedly emphasized the importance of half-court positioning and tactical execution, rather than relying on fast-paced and unpredictable offense like in the past. This change is aimed at creating a unique system for the team.</p> <p>In the preseason games, players showed an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, and were able to effectively execute the team's half-court offense. This could be attributed to the experience gained by the six players who participated in the FIBA World Cup. The team's pace and assist numbers have also improved, showing the success of Finch's emphasis on half-court offense.</p> <p>Moving on to the game strategies, the team will focus on utilizing the high post and creating opportunities for players like Ant and Conley to cut to the basket. Players like NAW and Big-Mac have also shown great cutting skills, making them valuable assets in breaking through the opponent's defense.</p> <p>The success of the team's offense in the upcoming season will heavily rely on Karl-Anthony Towns' composure and decision-making abilities. He will need to prove that he can adapt to the new system and not disrupt the team's offensive rhythm. However, there were also some concerning moments, such as when Towns struggled in low post situations against the Knicks and when Ant had difficulty scoring against Caruso and Gobert. These issues will need to be addressed and improved upon in the regular season.</p> <p>On the defensive end, the addition of Rudy Gobert has greatly improved the team's defensive efficiency. However, there are concerns about his tendency to stick to his comfort zone and not adjust to different defensive strategies. It will be crucial for him to be more versatile and adapt to different situations in order to have a positive impact on the team's chemistry and offensive execution.</p> <p>In conclusion, the Timberwolves have made progress in both their offensive and defensive strategies in the preseason. However, there are still areas that need improvement and adjustments, which will be observed in the upcoming regular season.</p>"},{"location":"20231116091230414034/","title":"In the fourth quarter, the Denver Nuggets took a significant lead and their fans could be heard shouting \"Who's your daddy?\" throughout the arena","text":"<p>In the fourth quarter, the Denver Nuggets took a significant lead and their fans could be heard shouting \"Who's your daddy?\" throughout the arena.

Among the list of international teams, the \"Bundang Business High School\" from South Korea is the most anticipated. The school has been nicknamed the \"High School Queen of Korea\" and has established a dynasty in the Korean high school basketball scene. It has also become an important breeding ground for professional women's basketball players and national team members in recent years. Despite being a relatively new team, Bundang Business High School has risen to become one of the top teams in women's high school basketball in Korea.</p> <p>Since its establishment in December 2007, Bundang Business High School has achieved impressive results, including a third-place finish at the 2010 National Joint Association Basketball Championship and a silver medal at the 92nd National Sports Festival in 2011. In the following two years (2014-2015), the team swept all major competitions in women's high school basketball in Korea, solidifying their dominance. They also hold the record for the longest undefeated streak (three years) in the KSSBF Korean High School Basketball League.</p> <p>As we continue to introduce the Bundang Business High School women's basketball team, they have once again completed a three-peat in the first half of this year's national tournaments. (Source: Bundang Business High School) As an emerging powerhouse in Korean high school women's basketball, Bundang Business High School has produced numerous national team members and professional players in the past decade. The most well-known player is Park Ji-soo, who is known as the \"Best Female Center in Korean History\" and \"Basketball Prodigy.\" She became the youngest (16 years old) female basketball player in Korean history to join the national team and was selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the 5th overall pick in the 2018 WNBA Draft, making her the second Korean player to enter the WNBA after Jung Sun-min, who played for the Seattle Storm in 2003. In addition, three players who led the Korean team to the round of 16 in the 2021 U19 Women's World Cup, namely Pyun Soo-jung, Koh Na-yeon, and Park So-hee, are also graduates of Bundang Business High School. Pyun Soo-jung and Park So-hee were even selected as the second and third overall picks in the WKBL draft last season, earning the title of \"Rookie Monsters.\"</p> <p>Park Ji-soo, who was born in Bundang Business High School, has become one of the most highly-regarded female basketball players in Korea. (Source: Bundang Business High School) In the first half of this year, Bundang Business High School won three consecutive championships in national tournaments (the 60th Spring National Middle School Basketball Federation Championship, the 48th Association President's Middle School Basketball Championship, and the 2023 King of Kings Weekend Basketball League). Three players from the current team, namely Seo Yu-jung, Park Do-yuan, and Pyun Heo-jung, have been selected to represent their school in the Changyao Cup. They are highly regarded in the development of Korean high school women's basketball and recently announced their participation in the 2023-24 WKBL draft, becoming the latest focus in the Korean basketball community.</p> <p>Despite being a dominant force in Korean high school basketball, Bundang Business High School faces challenges when it comes to competing on the international stage. This is a hurdle that they are determined to overcome in order to continue their growth and development. As international competitions resume after the pandemic, Bundang Business High School is honored to be invited as one of the five international teams participating in the Changyao Cup. The coaching staff hopes that this will be a valuable opportunity for the team to showcase their skills and abilities that have led them to multiple national championships, as well as learn from other top teams and gain international experience. They also hope that this experience will benefit the players' future development, and potentially open doors for their professional careers.

But if he can also manage to handle Harris' expiring contract, there's a chance for the Sixers to make another push during Embiid's prime. Whether or not they can find a suitable wing player in return remains to be seen, but the window for a championship this year is definitely smaller than last year's.</p>"},{"location":"20231117091223916961/","title":"2223 Flying Apes Season: Rediscovering Himself in the Chaotic Postseason","text":"<p>Ever since his outstanding performance in the second season, Lu Junxiang has become the shining star of the Flying Apes    2223 Flying Apes Season: Rediscovering Himself in the Chaotic Postseason</p> <p>Ever since his outstanding performance in the second season, Lu Junxiang has become the shining star of the Flying Apes.</p> <p>However, this title was not enough as Lu Junxiang's leadership only led the team to bottom of the standings in the second season.</p> <p>Like a king in a makeshift kingdom, he still had not proven himself against other powerful forces. But people still have high hopes for his development, and in my opinion, he possesses the necessary competitive mentality as an athlete. Whenever facing star players from the opposing team, I always feel his desire to score intensify. Although he may not have the same level of firepower as players like Lin Zhijie and Yang Jingmin, he always approaches these veterans with a positive attitude and a willingness to compete.</p> <p>But all of this happened before his slump. Lu Junxiang's performance in the third season has been a rollercoaster ride like I have never seen since the establishment of P. LEAGUE+. Usually, when a player's performance is not up to par, it only takes one or two games to adjust. If their performance remains poor for the whole season, it could be due to poor team chemistry.</p> <p>However, Lu Junxiang's situation was neither of the above. In the beginning of the season, he played like a star player, but then his performance drastically declined. Even coming off the bench seemed like a struggle, to the point where even Coach Caminos did not let him play for a period of time. I also asked a few teams about this, and they all said that they did not have any specific defensive strategies against Lu Junxiang during that time. It wasn't until the postseason that Lu Junxiang gradually regained his form.</p> <p>He once again became the main scoring option for the Flying Apes in the postseason, with an average of over 20 points per game.</p> <p>Please continue reading for my analysis on why the postseason helped Lu Junxiang find his game.</p> <p>Basketball is a funny sport, the more you focus on personal performance and shooting percentage, the more hesitant you become to take shots. In the postseason, you don't have time to worry about your own form, you can only focus on how to help the team win, otherwise, the team will face elimination. Of course, this is just my speculation, only Lu Junxiang knows the real reason behind his return to form.</p> <p>But even off the court, we often see people struggle when they put too much pressure on themselves or become too fixated on something. Sometimes, all it takes is a change in mindset to overcome a challenge. In the movie Men in Black, whenever the main characters face a dead end, they would go to a diner in New York to eat pie and relax. Afterwards, they would inadvertently come up with a new idea or solution.</p> <p>Perhaps in the postseason, Lu Junxiang's change in mindset allowed him to focus on helping the team instead of being lost in his own form. This season's analysis will continue below. Since last season, Lu Junxiang has been the most lethal scorer for the Flying Apes, but he is not what I would consider a pure scorer. Lu Junxiang's offense mainly consists of outside shooting and cuts to the basket, and his repertoire is not particularly diverse. He just has more opportunities to shoot and a higher shooting accuracy compared to other players on the team. From the shot distribution chart (see diagram below) that I have mentioned in previous articles, we can see that Lu Junxiang's main scoring areas are concentrated in the paint and three-point range.</p> <p>In modern basketball, this is considered a good thing. People have gradually realized that mid-range shots are not as efficient as they once thought, and they have been dubbed as the \"furthest two-point shot\". However, if taken to the extreme, it can make the offensive player easier to predict. For example, when Lu Junxiang tries to drive to the basket, you would simply back off to the paint, knowing that he is less likely to take a jump shot.</p> <p>A good scorer should be able to create multiple threats and scoring options while holding the ball. For example, when Carmelo Anthony has the ball at the free throw line, he could shoot his signature mid-range jump shot, drive to the basket, or post up to take advantage of his low-post moves. Therefore, tactics designed for a scorer would often try to get the ball to them in the most threatening position and then clear the way for them to showcase their one-on-one skills.</p> <p>However, the Flying Apes rarely design tactics for Lu Junxiang in this manner. Instead, they often utilize catch and shoot plays or elevator screens for him, or create ball screens and handoffs. It is rare to see the team deliberately design isolation plays for Lu Junxiang, allowing him to take on the opponent by himself. Although he is not a pure scorer, Lu Junxiang still managed to average 14.3 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 1.7 steals this season.</p> <p>His scoring average ranks fourth among local players, behind Lin Shujie, Gao Guohao, and Yang Jingmin. He also led the league in steals, making him not just an offensive threat, but also a contributor on the defensive end.</p> <p>Thanks to these statistics, he was selected to the All-League First Team and Defensive First Team for the third season in a row. You may argue that there are other players who are stronger defenders than him, but since other potential contenders were registered as \"guards\", Lu Junxiang, who had the steals statistics to back him up, was the obvious choice.</p> <p>As for the turnover issue mentioned in last year's point guard analysis, it still plagues Lu Junxiang. He ranked third among local players in turnovers, behind only the Lin brothers. His turnovers have officially surpassed his assists, and if he wants to become a more efficient scorer, he needs to reduce his turnovers.

The player with the higher score was then given a higher ranking. The two players that Martin mentioned were this year's first overall pick Victor Wembanyama and third overall pick Scoot Henderson, who were ranked 48th and 78th, respectively. Both of them were ranked higher than Westbrook, who was ranked 94th.</p> <p>Westbrook has been playing in the NBA for 15 seasons and has accumulated 37552 minutes on the court. He was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers last year and still managed to average 15.9 points, 7.5 assists, and 5.8 rebounds per game.

He was invited by his senior teammates to join the team, and he said with a smile, \"I am very happy to be able to play with different generations of senior players.

They also thank all the staff for providing us with such a wonderful stage and environment.

Why didn't I consider the Bucks as a potential landing spot for Lillard? It's not just because Holiday is irreplaceable, but also because they don't have enough draft picks to trade for Lillard.</p> <p>Just using Holiday and a first-round pick, plus two pick swaps, to upgrade their point guard to a Tier-0 scoring guard in the league is definitely a steal. Although it's not all bad, Holiday puts too much effort on defense, which leads to his inconsistent offense in the playoffs. Especially since Giannis mentioned wanting to strengthen the team, and Holiday has previously said he will retire after his contract ends, it's understandable why the Bucks would target him.</p> <p>But the more important thing is that the Bucks have never had a need for a ball-dominant scoring guard since Giannis joined the team. Lopez, Giannis, and even Middleton don't need much ball-handling, especially with MVP Giannis being able to play off-ball and make cuts.</p> <p>Although Lillard won't be able to play the same way he did with the Trail Blazers, constantly having the ball in his hands and carrying the team, he should be able to adapt to being a pick-and-roll ball handler and reduce his isolation play. Your pick-and-roll partner is now upgraded to Giannis, do you still need to handle the ball every possession? The question now is, how will the Bucks make up for the loss of Grayson Allen and Jrue Holiday's perimeter defense? Honestly, they don't have to.</p> <p>The Bucks' problem has always been their inconsistent offense from the backcourt. As mentioned before, Holiday has his issues and Carter, Allen, and Connaughton are all defensively-minded and inconsistent on offense. It seems like the Bucks are willing to sacrifice some perimeter defense in exchange for a more stable backcourt initiator.</p> <p>Especially since their defensive strength has always been in the paint, as long as the guards can navigate screens and prevent the first pass, allowing Giannis to roam and protect the rim, with Lopez cleaning up, they'll be fine.</p> <p>The Bucks have lowered their opponents' field goal percentage in the paint by 2.8% this year, all thanks to their paint protectors. Although Holiday is responsible for guarding the opposing team's star player, it's uncertain if they'll be able to find someone to fill that role in the future. Middleton is getting older, Crowder, forget it. It might end up being Lillard or Connaughton, but it must be said that Lillard has shown effort on defense at the beginning of the season, and his poor defensive stats were largely due to the team's overall poor defense. But if they utilize a 3-2 zone defense, with Lillard designated as the chaser/low activity defender, he won't become a black hole on defense.</p> <p>Now let's talk about the rumored trade with the Heat, who Lillard has expressed his desire to join. The Trail Blazers obviously didn't give in, and the trade package the Heat could offer wasn't attractive either, with Herro, Lowry, and Robinson being the potential players to be included, plus two first-round picks. No wonder the Trail Blazers weren't interested in negotiating with the Heat.</p> <p>But sending him to the Bucks also satisfies Giannis, who has expressed his liking for Lillard. After all, during the All-Star draft this year, Giannis passed on Holiday and chose Lillard with the first pick.</p> <p>Now they're basically doing the same thing...right? The Trail Blazers managed to get a lot of assets for Lillard, including a first-round pick, two pick swaps, this year's All-Star Holiday, and number one overall pick Ayton. It seems like a lot on paper.</p> <p>Especially since Holiday only has a 1+1 contract, making $36 million won't be too difficult, and his trade value is still high. The Trail Blazers should act as arms dealers, taking advantage of other teams' desire to strengthen their team after the Bucks' trade and exchange for more assets.</p> <p>For example, we can first sell Lillard to the Bucks and then tell everyone, \"The Eastern Conference is dangerous, do any of you need Jrue Holiday to guard Lillard?\" and then cheat them out of their assets.</p> <p>As long as the team acquiring Holiday can offer expiring contracts and enough first-round picks, I believe the Trail Blazers will consider it.</p> <p>Of course, the combined $90 million contract of Simons, Grant, and Ayton for at least three years is not something the Trail Blazers would consider taking on.</p> <p>But if they can get a young, promising wing player in return, the Trail Blazers might consider it. As for Ayton, sigh. I personally don't like him, although his potential is higher than the already established Nurkic, Ayton's excellent interior defense is the best addition the Trail Blazers could make. Although they'll lose the threat of pick-and-pop and handoffs, if Billups plans to completely revamp their offense and defense system, reducing double teams and increasing pick-and-roll and low-post plays, the Henderson-Ayton connection could still be a threat in the future.</p> <p>Lastly, there's Allen. If you really see him as your solution, the Trail Blazers wouldn't have traded him back. But if they can get a young, long-range shooting wing player in return, they might consider it.</p>"},{"location":"20231119091132864176/","title":"P","text":"<p>P.LEAGUE I am not afraid of facing reality as a Dreamer</p> <p>The four consecutive wins in the preseason mean nothing, the real challenge begins after the season starts.

In the first game of the season, held at their home court in Changhua, the Dreamers failed to hold on to their halftime lead and were overtaken by the opponent's outside shooting in the second half.

Lu Zhengru, who played a crucial role in the Ironmen's victory, responded to his coach by saying they have been working together for a long time, and he has been a fan of Qiu Dazong since he was young.

The Dreamers' head coach, Jamie Pearlman, believes that starting the season with a loss is not a good result, but it is a good learning experience for the team. He also told the players after the game that the long season has just begun, and although losing is disappointing, it is a process that requires teamwork and adjustments to find the best way for the team to play.</p> <p>Julian Boyd, who returned to the team, had the best performance for the Dreamers with a team-high 30 points. \"Big B\" Gilberto also had a double-double with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Although Xin Woke, Lin Jungi, and Michael Calder all scored in double digits, they were unable to defeat the opponent. After the game, Boyd said he was happy to be back with the team, but unfortunately, they lost their first game of the season. Although he scored the most points for the team, his shooting percentage was not good. As the coach said, this is just the first game of the season, and there is still a long way to go. They need to work harder in many areas.</p> <p>Please continue reading The Ironmen made 18 three-pointers in the game, which was one of the reasons why the Dreamers lost at home.

These are all part of the team's growth, and he believes that zone defense will be beneficial for the Dreamers this season.</p> <p>Additionally, Coach Pearlman mentioned that some players were slow to warm up. Although they had a good free throw percentage (32 out of 40), when they were leading or when the opponent started to catch up, they became hesitant or took forced shots.

Despite the seemingly typical outcome, the game was full of interesting and unexpected moments. The Bulls did not rely on their usual strategy of two star players to carry the team, while the Bucks utilized different players and methods to secure the win.</p> <p>One of the unfamiliar Bucks players who made a big impact in the game was Khris Middleton. He may not have stood out in terms of stats, but his defense and offense in the fourth quarter shut down the Bulls' attempts to catch up while Giannis Antetokounmpo was off the court. Another key player was Andre Jackson Jr., who played a crucial role in creating scoring opportunities and defending the perimeter.</p> <p>In terms of statistics, the Bulls struggled with their two-point shots in the first half, shooting only 34.6% compared to their 38.1% from three-point range. This was due to their reliance on DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine's drives, which may have been effective but did not create enough opportunities for the team as a whole.</p> <p>On the positive side, despite LaVine and DeRozan shooting a combined 33 shots and making only 8, the Bulls were still able to keep the game close, showing that they have strong supporting players on the team. However, the fact that the team continues to struggle in the first half raises questions about how the main players are being utilized.</p> <p>In terms of individual players, Nikola Vucevic and Torrey Craig stood out for their consistent performances and hustle plays that gave the team hope during tough moments. A key moment in the game was when the Bulls were only down by one point with 3 minutes and 45 seconds left in the third quarter, and they were able to contain the Bucks' attack led by Damian Lillard.</p> <p>In the post-game analysis, it was clear that the Bulls' strategy was to have a well-rounded team where every player can contribute, while the Bucks relied heavily on their All-Star players and struggled to find support. On the defensive end, the Bulls utilized multiple players while the Bucks focused on defending the main threats.</p> <p>Overall, the game showed that the Bulls have potential but need to fine-tune their strategies and utilize their players more effectively. The Bucks, on the other hand, need to rely less on their star players and find ways to involve the rest of the team in their game plan.</p> <p>Join the discussion with Bulls fans in the \"Chicago Bulls Fans\" group and for more sports content, check out \"AhUtopian's Sports Talk.\" For legal and business discussions, join \"Fish with Four Leaves - Lawyer Yu Zongming,\" and for season and pre-season analysis, check out \"RegBulls Post-Game Analysis.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231119091159580246/","title":"\u4e0d\u904e\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bcSGA\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u5929\u8ce6\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\u53ea\u662f\u77ed\u66ab\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u5728\u4ed6\u7684\u5e74\u7d00\uff0c\u4ed6\u5df2\u7d93\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u4e86\u6210\u70baNBA\u660e\u661f\u7403\u54e1\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u4e5f\u70ba\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u570b\u5bb6\u968a\u5e36\u4f86\u4e86\u7121\u9650\u7684\u5e0c\u671b\u3002\u4ed6\u5c07\u6210\u70ba\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u7403\u8ff7\u7684\u65b0\u5076\u50cf\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c07\u57282023\u5e74\u4e16\u754c\u76c3\u70ba\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u968a\u625b\u8d77\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u8cac\u4efb\uff0c\u6210\u70ba\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u65b0\u738b\u724c\u3002\u5c31\u50cf\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u7c4dNBA\u50b3\u5947\u7403\u661fSteve Nash\u4e00\u6a23\uff0cSGA\u4e5f\u5c07\u627f\u64d4\u8d77\u63a5\u73ed\u4eba\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u70ba\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u7c43\u7403\u5e36\u4f86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u69ae\u8000\u3002\u671f\u5f85\u8457\u770b\u5230\u4ed6\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u570b\u969b\u8cfd\u821e\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u7cbe\u5f69\u8868\u73fe\uff01","text":"<p>\u4e0d\u904e\uff0c\u5c0d\u65bcSGA\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u5929\u8ce6\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u554f\u984c\u53ea\u662f\u77ed\u66ab\u7684\u6311\u6230\u3002\u5728\u4ed6\u7684\u5e74\u7d00\uff0c\u4ed6\u5df2\u7d93\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u4e86\u6210\u70baNBA\u660e\u661f\u7403\u54e1\u7684\u6f5b\u529b\uff0c\u4e5f\u70ba\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u570b\u5bb6\u968a\u5e36\u4f86\u4e86\u7121\u9650\u7684\u5e0c\u671b\u3002\u4ed6\u5c07\u6210\u70ba\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u7403\u8ff7\u7684\u65b0\u5076\u50cf\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c07\u57282023\u5e74\u4e16\u754c\u76c3\u70ba\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u968a\u625b\u8d77\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u8cac\u4efb\uff0c\u6210\u70ba\u4ed6\u5011\u7684\u65b0\u738b\u724c\u3002\u5c31\u50cf\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u7c4dNBA\u50b3\u5947\u7403\u661fSteve Nash\u4e00\u6a23\uff0cSGA\u4e5f\u5c07\u627f\u64d4\u8d77\u63a5\u73ed\u4eba\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u70ba\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u7c43\u7403\u5e36\u4f86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u69ae\u8000\u3002\u671f\u5f85\u8457\u770b\u5230\u4ed6\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u570b\u969b\u8cfd\u821e\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u7cbe\u5f69\u8868\u73fe\uff01</p>"},{"location":"20231119091203616248/","title":"According to Shams, sources revealed that the Houston Rockets have been in contact with several teams to send away Kevin Porter Jr","text":"<p>According to Shams, sources revealed that the Houston Rockets have been in contact with several teams to send away Kevin Porter Jr. following an incident of domestic violence.

The judge also issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting Porter from contacting his ex-girlfriend.

long-awaited 2022-23 NBA season is about to kick off, and it's time for various authoritative media to rank the top 100 players for the new season! ESPN and Sports Illustrated (hereinafter referred to as \"SI\") will once again select the top 100 players for fans. ESPN has been doing this for 12 consecutive years, while SI has been doing it for 10 years. How will the MVP favorites of the league, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, and Joel Embiid, be ranked? What leaps will the highly anticipated rookies and superstars make? Let's continue reading to see where the seemingly immortal cyborg LeBron James will be in his 20th season. What are the differences between ESPN and SI rankings? Below, let's take a look (based on ESPN rankings) at the top 100 players from the 2021-22 season (this article covers No. 11-25):</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49Continued from previous article: NBA Top 100 Players for 2022-23 Season - No. 76-100 \ud83d\udc49Continued from previous article: NBA Top 100 Players for 2022-23 Season - No. 51-75 \ud83d\udc49Continued from previous article: NBA Top 100 Players for 2022-23 Season - No. 26-50 \ud83d\udc49Continued from previous article: NBA Top 100 Players for 2022-23 Season - No. 11-25</p> <p>No. 10: Devin Booker Phoenix Suns | Shooting Guard SI Ranking: 12 ESPN Ranking: 15 SI Ranking: 16</p> <p>Please continue reading The highly anticipated 25-year-old Booker has been selected to the All-Star team three times and made it to the All-NBA Team. With his beautiful offensive style, Booker will continue to be one of the top shooting guards in the league in the coming years.</p> <p>Booker has shone in recent years - from making it to the NBA Finals, winning the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics, leading the Suns to a league-best 64 wins in the regular season, to ultimately losing in an unexpected outcome. The Suns were surprisingly defeated by the Mavericks in the second round of the Western Conference, and in the crucial Game 6 and Game 7, Booker failed to step up and only made 9 out of 31 shots.</p> <p>However, this cannot erase his high standard of 26.8 points per game (12th in the league). Booker can be considered one of the most lethal scoring aces in the league. However, he must be able to show these scoring skills in critical moments: last season, his overall shooting percentage was as high as 48.5% in the first 9 minutes of a quarter, and his three-point shooting percentage was even higher at 42.1%. However, in the last three minutes, these two numbers dropped to 41.8% and 31.8%, respectively.</p> <p>Please continue reading No. 9: Ja Morant Memphis Grizzlies | Point Guard SI Ranking: 14 ESPN Ranking: 31 SI Ranking: 25</p> <p>Morant may be the most entertaining player in the NBA today. His amazing jumping ability, along with his almost arrogant confidence and courage, has turned the once low-key Grizzlies into a visual feast for all fans. In just one year, Morant has transformed from a cornerstone player of the Grizzlies into a super superstar in the league. His average of 27.1 points per game is a huge jump of 8 points, and he has also won the Most Improved Player award at the end of the season.</p> <p>At only 6 feet 3 inches tall, Ja is a true inside scoring master. His style of play is a combination of explosiveness, skill, and fearlessness. Last season, 16.6 points per game came from the paint, making him the first guard to lead this statistic in nearly 25 years.</p> <p>What will he evolve into in the new season?</p> <p>No. 8: Kevin Durant Brooklyn Nets | Small Forward SI Ranking: 4 ESPN Ranking: 1 SI Ranking: 1</p> <p>Durant has been making headlines during the off-season. He first requested to be traded, then changed his mind after no takers, and finally had to return to the Nets.</p> <p>After this drama, how will he readjust to the torn Nets culture and his relationship with the management and head coach? His conflict with the Nets will be one of the most interesting questions in the new season.</p> <p>When Durant is on the court, he is one of the most powerful players on Earth. The question is, will he age? In fact, he has already taken a leap forward in 2019-20, and then took another step in 2020-21.</p> <p>In 2015-16, his three-point shooting percentage was 45.4%, ranking first in history. Then in 2019-20, his three-point shooting percentage was 42.6%, ranking second in history. In 2020-21, his three-point shooting percentage was 42.1%, ranking third in history.</p> <p>This is an impossible achievement. Is his three-point shooting improving or regressing?</p> <p>No. 7: Stephen Curry Golden State Warriors | Shooting Guard SI Ranking: 7 ESPN Ranking: 6 SI Ranking: 4</p> <p>Curry had the greatest regular season performance in the league in 2014-15, and then had the greatest season ever.</p> <p>But his greatness does not mean he won't age. In fact, he has already taken a few leaps forward in 2019-20, and then took another step in 2020-21.</p> <p>In 2015-16, his three-point shooting percentage was 45.4%, ranking first in history. Then in 2019-20, his three-point shooting percentage was 42.6%, ranking second in history. Then in 2020-21, his three-point shooting percentage was 42.1%, ranking third in history.</p> <p>This is an impossible achievement.

The 25-year-old Billy, who has multiple experiences playing in professional leagues around the world, is expected to contribute on both ends of the court for the Kings. Originally from California, Billy was a five-star high school player and received offers from top NCAA schools, including the University of Kansas. His impressive athleticism is his trademark, and he also has a great outside shooting ability. His excellent driving skills make him a playmaker on the court. Although he was not drafted in the 2018 NBA draft, he played for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the summer league and signed a two-way contract with their G League team, the Cleveland Charge, to start his professional career. He then moved on to play in other professional leagues, most recently in South Africa for the Cape Town Tigers, where he averaged 16.6 points and 9.4 rebounds per game. Regarding Billy's signing, general manager Mao Gaen said, \"Billy can be considered a modern-day power forward with excellent athleticism and the ability to both drive and shoot. His agility and height make him a strong defender for the Kings. At only 25 years old, he still has tremendous potential and we are excited to see him play alongside Mullen and Manny in the new season.

After the game, reports surfaced of a team meeting with only players present. Let's review this game in the following categories.</p> <p>Keep reading for Stats: Last season, the Bulls had the lowest three-point attempts per game at 28.9, but in this game, they attempted 42 shots. Although they only made 12 and had a dismal shooting percentage, it at least shows that the team is making progress in improving their shot distribution.</p> <p>Good: The Bulls had more offensive rebounds and steals than the Thunder, giving them many more shot opportunities.</p> <p>Bad: The Thunder's Drive and Kick strategy completely tore apart the Bulls' defense in the second half, leading to their hot shooting and a bigger lead. Was this a result of poor defensive strategy?</p> <p>Player: Torrey Craig's presence brings more versatility to the Bulls' lineup.

The Lions dominated the first half, but were caught up by the PLG in the third quarter. In the end, the PLG successfully turned the tables and secured their first preseason victory. In the first quarter, the Lions continued their strong momentum from yesterday, with 10 players scoring in the first half. The team did not rely on their foreign players to score, playing a smooth and sharing offensive game. They also had a 50% three-point shooting percentage, hitting 9 three-pointers and leading the PLG 57-40 at halftime. The PLG had more shot attempts in the first half, but their shooting percentage was not ideal. Only Zhang Zhenya's 9 points, including 3 three-pointers, stood out.</p> <p>In this game, the Lions did not follow the same strategy as the previous one, choosing to continue playing their foreign players in the second half to build chemistry. However, the PLG's foreign player, Max, scored continuously in the paint, helping the team narrow the gap. The Lions focused on outside shots in this quarter, but they couldn't find their rhythm and also got into foul trouble. Their 17-point lead disappeared and the game was tied going into the fourth quarter. In the decisive fourth quarter, both Kela and Brown committed unsportsmanlike fouls, giving the PLG an advantage in the beginning. The PLG's Lawrence stepped up and scored multiple times inside, disrupting the Lions' defense.</p> <p>In the final moments, when the team was struggling, Gao Guohao hit two consecutive three-pointers to keep the Lions in the game.

In the end, the PLG defeated the Attack Lions 91-82. Max finished with a team-high 17 points and 12 rebounds, while Lawrence had 13 points and 6 rebounds.

From the first quarter, they fell behind by double digits, and although they gradually recovered in the second quarter and narrowed the gap to 9 points, China extended their lead again after the break and won the game by 20 points, handing Chinese Taipei their first loss of the tournament.</p> <p>In a post on Instagram, basketball blogger @basketball_biji discussed the team's poor execution of tactics as the main reason for their defeat, despite the common belief that the gap in natural talent and lack of a strong point guard were to blame. When facing a taller and stronger opponent like China, it is crucial for Chinese Taipei to utilize their speed advantage to the fullest and create mismatches on the court. They had successfully demonstrated this strategy at the Chengdu Universiade earlier this year when they faced China in the group stage. However, in this game at the Hangzhou Asian Games, their attempts to use tactics like \"Flex\" to force China to switch defenders did not work as well. They spent a lot of time setting screens and cutting, but still could not create open shots, resulting in a never-ending cycle of one-on-one plays. Against China's strong defense, Chinese Taipei's players were not efficient in their individual efforts, with Lin Ting-chien and Liu Chen shooting less than 40% and only scoring a combined 18 points. Although William Joseph Artino scored 20 points, most of them came from tough physical plays. It is not fair to say that the execution of tactics by this team is worse than that of the team in the Universiade, as it is a relative measure and cannot be judged solely based on the result. The higher the level of defense they face, the more challenging it is to execute tactics effectively.</p> <p>Clearly, Chinese Taipei's tactics were not strong enough to overcome China's adult-level defense.</p> <p>One possible explanation for this could be the recent change in coaching staff, with coach Samuel Sun replacing Charlie Parker. The players may still need time to adapt to the new system, and the short preparation time before the tournament may have affected their chemistry and understanding of tactics.</p> <p>If players like Chen Ying-jun, Lin Wei-han, and Lee Kai-yen were healthy and able to play, they could have helped with the team's organization and control of the pace. However, the execution of tactics requires teamwork and a deep understanding of the tactics, which cannot be solved simply by adding more point guards. It will take time and effort to improve through training.</p> <p>Another aspect to consider is the team's personnel and tactics configuration. As discussed in a previous article, since coach Sun took over the team, there has been an increase in the number of plays that rely on tall players to initiate the offense. However, in this game against China, their perimeter defense was aggressive, making it difficult for Chinese Taipei's guards to receive passes and creating a stagnant offense. This is especially problematic when most of their tall players lack the skills to attack from the perimeter, and they struggle to find open players or create shots for themselves, resulting in a low efficiency offense.</p> <p>To minimize the disadvantage in size, Chinese Taipei usually plays with two tall players on the court at the same time. However, when their power forwards and centers are not effective on offense, the coaching staff could consider using a \"small-ball\" lineup, with players like Lee Chi-wei playing as a stretch four. After all, the coaching staff has used Tseng Hsiang-chun as a sharpshooter, so it may be better to replace him with a player with a higher three-point shooting percentage to speed up ball movement and create more open shots.</p> <p>Chinese Taipei's defense in the paint was commendable, as Artino did a decent job of containing China's Wang Zhelin and even drew two offensive fouls from him. Although they were out-rebounded by 18, they only allowed China to score 17 points from second-chance opportunities, showing that they did not rely solely on their size to defend. However, their lack of focus was evident, as they were beaten by Zhang Zhenlin's baseline cuts multiple times and were slow to rotate on defense in transition, allowing China to score 18 fastbreak points compared to their 7. When facing a more talented opponent, it is crucial to maintain the basics and play at their own level to have a chance at winning. If they cannot even do that, narrowing the gap in natural talent is out of the question.</p> <p>Therefore, before discussing the difference in natural talent between Chinese Taipei and China, it may be more important to focus on their teamwork, focus on defense, and other fundamental aspects.</p>"},{"location":"20231121091128488597/","title":"NBA star Joel Embiid has announced his decision to play for the United States in the 2024 Paris Olympics","text":"<p>NBA star Joel Embiid has announced his decision to play for the United States in the 2024 Paris Olympics.

In his debut in yesterday's preseason game, he scored an impressive 28 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists. The handsome Gaddefors also revealed after the game that he has been told he resembles Joel Kinnaman, the Swedish actor from \"Suicide Squad\".  Gaddefors, who has represented Sweden in the EuroBasket and FIBA World Cup European Qualifiers, won the MVP in the Swedish Basketball League in 2021. He joined New Taipei CITIC Attack for the first time this year and made his debut in the team's jersey in today's preseason game. He showed excellent penetration skills, frequently breaking through the defense of the Eagles' twin towers to score inside.  Gaddefors ended up with 28 points on 11-of-21 shooting, along with 5 rebounds and 4 assists, making him the highlight of the game for the Attack. When asked about his performance in the first game, Gaddefors admitted that there are still a few national team players who have not played yet, but he was satisfied with his performance today.  When asked if he has been told he resembles any celebrity, Gaddefors smiled and said that many people have told him he is handsome since he came to Taiwan, \"and that's the truth.\" He also revealed that he has been told he looks like Joel Kinnaman, the Swedish actor who played Rick Flag in \"Suicide Squad\".  As a former Swedish national team player, Gaddefors had a showdown with Chris Paul, who was playing for the Oklahoma City Thunder at the time, in the 2013 EuroBasket. This is his first time appearing in a Taiwanese basketball game and he is looking forward to showcasing his skills in the T1 League.</p>"},{"location":"20231121091148079543/","title":"\u5118\u7ba1\u4ed6\u5df2\u7d9338\u6b72\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662fMarc Gasol\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u8457\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u9ad4\u80fd\u548c\u7403\u6280\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728B\u00e0squet Girona\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4ecd\u7136\u8b93\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u4ed6\u5df2\u7d93\u5728NBA\u6548\u529b\u4e8613\u500b\u8cfd\u5b63\uff0c\u4f46\u662fMarc Gasol\u4ecd\u7136\u5c0d\u7c43\u7403\u5145\u6eff\u71b1\u60c5\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5920\u7e7c\u7e8c\u6253\u7403\u3002","text":"<p>\u76ee\u524dNBA\u9084\u6c92\u6709\u8003\u616e\u9000\u5f79Marc Gasol\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u96a8\u8457\u4ed6\u5e74\u9f61\u7684\u589e\u9577\uff0c\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u5e7e\u5e74\u6210\u70ba\u73fe\u5be6\u3002\u7121\u8ad6\u5982\u4f55\uff0cMarc Gasol\u90fd\u5c07\u7e7c\u7e8c\u4eab\u53d7\u7c43\u7403\u5e36\u7d66\u4ed6\u7684\u5feb\u6a02\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u7121\u8ad6\u4ed6\u7684\u8077\u696d\u751f\u6daf\u4f55\u6642\u7d50\u675f\uff0c\u4ed6\u90fd\u5c07\u6c38\u9060\u88ab\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u6240\u61f7\u5ff5\u3002    \u5118\u7ba1\u4ed6\u5df2\u7d9338\u6b72\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662fMarc Gasol\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u8457\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u9ad4\u80fd\u548c\u7403\u6280\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728B\u00e0squet Girona\u7684\u8868\u73fe\u4ecd\u7136\u8b93\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u4ed6\u5df2\u7d93\u5728NBA\u6548\u529b\u4e8613\u500b\u8cfd\u5b63\uff0c\u4f46\u662fMarc Gasol\u4ecd\u7136\u5c0d\u7c43\u7403\u5145\u6eff\u71b1\u60c5\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5920\u7e7c\u7e8c\u6253\u7403\u3002</p> <p>\u76ee\u524dNBA\u9084\u6c92\u6709\u8003\u616e\u9000\u5f79Marc Gasol\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u96a8\u8457\u4ed6\u5e74\u9f61\u7684\u589e\u9577\uff0c\u9019\u500b\u554f\u984c\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u5e7e\u5e74\u6210\u70ba\u73fe\u5be6\u3002\u7121\u8ad6\u5982\u4f55\uff0cMarc Gasol\u90fd\u5c07\u7e7c\u7e8c\u4eab\u53d7\u7c43\u7403\u5e36\u7d66\u4ed6\u7684\u5feb\u6a02\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u7121\u8ad6\u4ed6\u7684\u8077\u696d\u751f\u6daf\u4f55\u6642\u7d50\u675f\uff0c\u4ed6\u90fd\u5c07\u6c38\u9060\u88ab\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u6240\u61f7\u5ff5\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231121091153312851/","title":"3 Lin Bingyi","text":"<p>3 Lin Bingyi.

In the end, Rose chose to sign a two-year, $6.55 million contract with the Memphis Grizzlies, returning to where his college career began, in the small city of Memphis.</p> <p>Derrick Rose's story is well-known to all basketball fans, and this article will not go into detail about it.</p> <p>With constant injuries, it is no exaggeration to say that he has had a tumultuous career. He once carried the Chicago Bulls on his shoulders and became the youngest MVP in NBA history. But last season, despite finally being able to stay healthy with the Knicks, his former coach Tom Thibodeau chose to freeze him out. Please continue reading below. He only played 27 games last season, averaging just 12.5 minutes per game, almost half of his playing time in the previous season, and only played for 3 minutes in the playoffs.</p> <p>\"Not being able to play even though he can\" is perhaps the most disheartening thing for Rose, and it was the main reason he decided to leave the Knicks after three seasons.</p> <p>If Derrick Rose is considered the most storied player in the league, I believe most fans would agree. With his vast experience, he chose to join the young Grizzlies in the late stages of his career, a decision that seems reasonable but leaves me a bit puzzled. After all, at this stage in his career and with his current condition, competing for a championship with a team that has the potential to win it all would have been the top priority. It's not that the Grizzlies don't have the ability, but after struggling in the playoffs for two consecutive seasons, they still have a long way to go before they can claim their first championship in franchise history. The reason why Rose chose to join the Grizzlies is clear: he not only wants to lead this group of young players, but also wants to prove that he can still play. There have been examples of veterans who did not prioritize chasing a championship ring and chose to join teams with a large number of young players, maintaining a certain amount of playing time, like Vince Carter. In the later stages of his career, Carter played for the Grizzlies, Kings, and Hawks, all of which were not considered contenders at the time. However, having such a experienced veteran on the team can somewhat help the young players grow.</p> <p>Please continue reading below. The Grizzlies gave fans endless hope last season, but ultimately brought disappointment.</p> <p>At the beginning of the season, Ja Morant's hot hands, combined with Desmond Bane's continued breakthroughs, maintained a certain level of competitiveness despite defensive flaws.</p> <p>Jaren Jackson Jr., who returned from injury, immediately filled the defensive hole in the team upon his return, and the Grizzlies' defensive efficiency went from being at the bottom of the league to the top. This was also reflected in their record, as they climbed their way up and became the team in the Western Conference with the best chance to challenge the Nuggets. However, Ja Morant's gun incident broke out. According to sources, just before this incident, the team's oldest player, Steven Adams, had just hosted a meeting in the locker room with only the players, mostly reminding the young players to follow the rules, especially when playing away games.</p> <p>But let's not forget that among this group of players with an average age of only 25, Adams was only 29 at the time. As the \"big brother\", his experience was perhaps a bit too limited. This incident revealed the problem that young teams often face when they lack a veteran leader.</p> <p>Although Jaren Jackson Jr. had a career year and was selected as the Defensive Player of the Year, the Grizzlies' interior defense suffered a heavy blow after Adams was sidelined, and they were dominated by Anthony Davis in the playoffs.</p> <p>Dillon Brooks, who has been with the Grizzlies the longest and should have been the team's leader, also caused the team to be labeled as \"arrogant and conceited\" due to his reckless behavior. On top of that, Morant's second gun incident followed, which was like a bucket of cold water being poured on fans' heads, and also forced management to take action. Please continue reading below. During the offseason, the Grizzlies let go of Dillon Brooks and traded for the more mature Marcus Smart, adding defensive strength and an \"energy guy\" role. With Derrick Rose's addition, not only can he fill the gap left by Morant's 25-game suspension at the start of the new season, but Rose's ranking as the fifth-best pick-and-roll player in the league, coupled with Adams' top-notch screening ability, will allow him to showcase his talents.</p> <p>Moreover, most importantly, this group of young and energetic players needs a veteran like Rose to guide them and keep them from losing their way. \"I'm not here to babysit or micromanage. I'm not here to be a plant in the locker room. I'm here to help guys win,\" Derrick Rose pointed out at the Grizzlies' media day, highlighting the problem that young players often face: they are unable to absorb advice from teammates of similar age. This is easily understandable, and coupled with the fact that all players who make it to the NBA must have a competitive spirit to survive in the league, it's even harder for them to listen to advice from someone of similar age. Therefore, Rose believes that there must be players with a certain age and experience to guide them, even though such players are becoming rarer in the league. Fortunately, the Grizzlies have welcomed Rose.</p> <p>His addition will not only bring stability to the team's scoring firepower, but also guide the young players on the court and help them grow faster. With Rose on board, the future looks even brighter for the Memphis Grizzlies, and the benefits he brings will far exceed fans' expectations.</p>"},{"location":"20231121091225020673/","title":"According to TA reporter Shams, Harden still hopes to join the Clippers","text":"<p>According to TA reporter Shams, Harden still hopes to join the Clippers.

The developments between Harden and Philadelphia have turned into the latest blockbuster soap opera in the NBA, with everyone waiting to see how it will all end. Harden made a bold statement at a recent media event in China, calling out Daryl Morey as a \"fraud\" and stating that he will never work with him again.</p> <p>He even repeated this declaration, as if it were a climactic moment in a stage play. Harden has chosen to execute his contract worth $35.6 million for the upcoming season and requested a trade from the team in June. The 76ers promised to do their best to make it happen in July, but by mid-August, ESPN reported that they were unsuccessful and planned to have Harden return for training camp. Based on Harden's recent comments, it seems that he voluntarily took a pay cut of $14 million last year, opting out of a $47 million player option, to sign a shorter contract and allow the team to strengthen P.J. Tucker and Danuel House Jr. This was a joint decision between him and Morey.</p> <p>In fact, the league conducted an investigation into the 76ers for illegally recruiting Tucker and House and revoked their second-round draft pick in 2023-24. However, there was no clear evidence found in the seized phones and emails to prove whether there was any \"premeditation\" between Harden and the 76ers.</p> <p>If Morey really made a promise to Harden, why would Harden start seeking a trade just two months into the new season? Around Christmas last year, ESPN received a tip that Harden was already eyeing a return to the Rockets, possibly as part of a homecoming act. If he was so sure about his next contract, why would he do that? Throughout last season, the 76ers were never certain that Harden would stay in the City of Brotherly Love. The message from Philadelphia was that they would be willing to offer him a new contract if he led them to a championship, or at least reached the NBA Finals. But in the end, they were eliminated in the second round, and Harden struggled, except for Games 1 and 4 against the Celtics where he scored 45 and 42 points respectively. In the other 9 games, he only averaged a disappointing 15.1 points (on 14.4 attempts), with a two-point and three-point shooting percentage of 29.6% and 30.5%, respectively. This was the most disappointing playoff performance of Harden's career.</p> <p>Source: Getty Images</p> <p>Despite trying to negotiate a new contract with the 76ers during the playoffs and before the start of free agency, Philadelphia refused to engage in any discussions until the market officially opened. This understandably upset Harden's camp - after all, the free agency market can change in an instant. But due to the previous sanctions, the 76ers were being cautious, which is understandable.</p> <p>Harden's reputation off the court and his decline on the court have affected his market value. Even his former team, the Rockets, didn't prioritize him and instead signed Fred VanVleet from the Northern Big Wild for $83.6 million over three years. As a result, Harden decided to play the player option and focus on money.</p> <p>Now, the Beard's desired destination, the Los Angeles Clippers, have also refused to offer a package that satisfies the 76ers, as Harden's performance has begun to decline. Looking ahead to the 2024 season, only the Spurs, Magic, Jazz, Raptors, Pistons, and Wizards have enough salary cap space to accommodate Harden, but it's unlikely that any of these teams will be interested. Harden's recent actions - declining a 3-year, $161 million extension with the Nets last year, the Rockets' reunion plan on Christmas last year, and now demanding a trade - all suggest that he is being led by someone else. He is currently on the only team in the league that wants to keep him and is willing to offer him the lucrative contract he wants, with a front office that has always been his staunch supporter. But even so, he has still messed things up.</p> <p>When it comes to Morey and Harden's relationship, they were supposed to be a success story of a GM and player working together - they almost achieved everything except winning a championship. But now, they have reached a point where they can't even stand each other. Morey has shifted his focus to core player Joel Embiid, while Harden is thinking about how to make the most out of his remaining years.</p> <p>At this point, can Harden force a trade by staying away from the team? The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) has a clause that protects the 76ers from any negative effects of Harden's actions. Will he resort to his old tactics of being lazy during training and disrupting team morale? If he repeats his past behavior or even takes more extreme measures to force the team's hand, it may backfire as other teams will also be watching. Regardless of what he does, the 76ers have been through a similar storm before. Last time, Morey patiently waited for the right offer and ended up trading Ben Simmons for Harden - the same path that Harden is now taking.</p> <p>\"If we do end up making a trade, it will have to meet one of these two goals,\" Morey said in an interview last month. \"Either we acquire a player who can help us perform as well as we did last season, or we acquire enough draft picks to build a team that can support Joel Embiid in the future. If neither goal can be met, we'd rather stay put.\"</p> <p>So far, no such deal has been made. But it could still happen at the last minute, just like in Simmons' case. Maybe next season, there will be teams like the Bulls who want to start over and are willing to trade for expiring contracts and some role players.</p> <p>Harden could also become a buyout candidate, or the Clippers could make a bold move mid-season if they see a chance to win a championship.</p> <p>But the pressure on the 76ers is greater than ever. Whether \"The Beard\" stays or goes, it will have consequences for the team's salary cap space next season. As more and more teams are approaching the salary cap limit, it's becoming increasingly difficult for teams to go over the hard cap. The 76ers are one of the few teams in the NBA with enough trade flexibility, so any potential deal involving Harden could have repercussions in the next season.</p> <p>\"We want to be one of the strongest teams next season, while also maintaining the flexibility to add a star player in the future,\" Morey said in an interview. \"To become a championship contender and still have the flexibility to acquire a superstar is a unique situation.\"</p> <p>Embiid is currently at the peak of his career at 29 years old, so giving up on next season for the 2024-25 season is hard to accept, especially since the 76ers may not find success in the free agency market.</p> <p>At this point, it would be a win-win for both sides if Harden returns to the 76ers and focuses on playing basketball. Embiid and Harden could form a dynamic duo on the court, and the 76ers know how to handle Harden's habits. It would also increase his trade value, whether it's for the Clippers or other underdogs, or even in the upcoming free agency market.</p> <p>However, things are not looking good at the moment, and both sides seem to be at a stalemate. The talk of trading Harden may have come to an end, but the end of this soap opera is still nowhere in sight.</p>"},{"location":"20231121091300646214/","title":"T1 Taishin War God Lin Ping-Sheng Signed with Taishin During CTBC Contract, Please Stop Slandering and Spreading Rumors","text":"<p>Photo/Basketball Notes</p> <p>On September 11th, T1 Basketball held a press conference with Taipei War God team leader, Shang Ruiqiang, accompanying player Lin Ping-Sheng to address recent controversies surrounding Lin's contract    T1 Taishin War God Lin Ping-Sheng Signed with Taishin During CTBC Contract, Please Stop Slandering and Spreading Rumors</p> <p>Photo/Basketball Notes</p> <p>On September 11th, T1 Basketball held a press conference with Taipei War God team leader, Shang Ruiqiang, accompanying player Lin Ping-Sheng to address recent controversies surrounding Lin's contract.</p> <p>Shang emphasized during the conference that Taishin Recreation and Lin's contract signing process were both in accordance with regulations. He expressed regret for the lawsuit and assured that the Taipei War God team will defend the company and player's rights and interests, while also being open to the public.</p> <p>Regarding the contract dispute, Lin Ping-Sheng first sincerely apologized at the press conference and thanked the media and fans for their concerns.</p> <p>As for the trouble caused between the War God team and Taishin team, he also expressed his deepest apologies. At the press conference, Lin Ping-Sheng explained the whole situation.</p> <p>Firstly, on May 25th, Mr. Zhang Yunzhi from Hsinchu City War God team contacted Lin Ping-Sheng through the current general manager of the War God team (then T1 League secretary-general), Mr. Zhang Shuren, to discuss the process. During the negotiations, Lin reminded them that according to the previous team's contract regulations, the War God team should first present an offer and only after the previous team's response, if the offer does not match, then they can sign the contract.</p> <p>However, in reality, before Lin Ping-Sheng terminated the contract and obtained a proof of departure to become a free agent, Mr. Zhang Yunzhi from Hsinchu City War God team still told Lin, \"It's okay to sign first.\" Secondly, the representative of the War God team also stated that they would add a clause to the contract that would not violate the previous team's contract regulations. Therefore, Lin Ping-Sheng believed that it was in line with regulations and without much thought, signed an appointment contract with the War God team on May 28th. However, this contract did not specify the start and end date of the appointment and set September 1st as the effective date.</p> <p>Later, when facing contact with other teams, the War God team also told Lin Ping-Sheng to keep it confidential and low-key. But after consulting with a lawyer about this contract, Lin Ping-Sheng realized that the appointment contract did not comply with procedures. Therefore, before confirming joining the Taishin team, Lin Ping-Sheng hoped to terminate the contract with the War God team. As a result, on June 28th, Lin Ping-Sheng informed Mr. Zhang Yunzhi of his decision not to join and apologized. After that, he also made it clear to the representative of the War God team that he had no intention of joining.</p> <p>The next day, on August 14th, Mr. Zhang Shuren contacted him and hoped to meet and discuss the contract after the Jones Cup tournament. During the meeting, Lin Ping-Sheng once again refused to join the War God team. The next day, on August 15th, Lin Ping-Sheng called Mr. Zhang Shuren and expressed the same decision not to join the War God team, and Mr. Zhang Shuren replied, \"The War God team will not announce the joining.\" After that, Lin Ping-Sheng also sent messages to Mr. Zhang Yunzhi and Mr. Zhang Shuren to express his position of not joining.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, at noon on the same day (August 15th), the War God team still announced the joining information. Therefore, on the morning of August 16th, Lin Ping-Sheng officially sent a letter of evidence to the War God team to express the termination of the previously signed unenforceable appointment contract. After obtaining a proof of departure from the previous team, Lin Ping-Sheng signed with the Taipei War God team, and the whole process was in line with regulations.</p> <p>Lin Ping-Sheng emphasized that his decision to join the Taipei War God team was based on the team's complete plan for overseas development, and the salary was similar to that of the War God team. However, the contract with the Taipei War God team was shorter, and the total salary was not as high as that of the War God team, contrary to rumors. The Taipei War God team condemned the malicious slandering and false accusations made by the War God team about Lin Ping-Sheng's contract dispute, and thanked the Basketball Association for its assistance. On September 4th, the Basketball Association held a hearing, and before the meeting, the Taipei War God team had provided relevant documents in accordance with the Basketball Association's letter and also attended. Lin Ping-Sheng had also informed the Basketball Association in advance that he would have a lawyer present, and it was not as the War God team claimed that he was \"absent without reason.\" In addition, the Basketball Association's press release after the hearing clearly stated that \"the meeting has not reached a conclusion,\" but the Taipei War God team was repeatedly attacked by the Hsinchu City War God team for not \"sincere in negotiation, evading responsibility, not in line with the consensus of the hearing, and having a fluctuating attitude.\" They attempted to create a negative image of the Taipei War God team to cover up their malicious slander and unreasonable demands, which was despicable and set a bad example for the sports industry.</p> <p>The Taipei War God team emphasized that they have always valued harmony and did not want to speak through the media. They are deeply regretful for resorting to litigation, but they have been repeatedly subjected to malicious attacks and unreasonable demands, and they can no longer remain silent. Therefore, they will fight to protect Taishin Recreation Company and the player's rights and interests.</p> <p>Since the controversy, the War God team's statements are inconsistent with the actual situation. Therefore, Lin Ping-Sheng held a press conference today with the Taipei War God team to explain the truth and hope to avoid the continuous spread of one-sided false information on the internet.</p> <p>At the end of the press conference, Lin Ping-Sheng once again expressed his personal apologies for causing trouble to the team and the recent disturbances in society and the basketball circle. He also hoped that everyone could give him a chance, and in the future, he will be more cautious and seek assistance from professional managers in handling contract matters.</p> <p>Facing the upcoming new season, Lin Ping-Sheng said he will focus on personal training and show his best performance on the court. He hopes everyone can continue to support him. The case has now been brought to the legal process, and everything will be left to the judiciary. Finally, the Taipei War God team once again strongly urged the Hsinchu City War God team to exercise restraint and stop spreading false information and wasting social resources. They also hope that the public will not be misled by false information. Taishin provided a timeline of the incident: May 25th, May 27th, May 28th, June 25th, June 28th, August 14th, August 15th, August 16th.</p>"},{"location":"20231121091320233731/","title":"In today's Bulls vs","text":"<p>In today's Bulls vs. Thunder game, last year's second overall pick, Chet Holmgren, made his NBA regular season debut.

However, this also brings out another concern-when Ant is not on the court, the team lacks a weapon that can create threats without the ball, making the ball flow but unable to truly tear the defense apart and create open shots. Big-Mac, who has the ability to handle the ball, also lacks enough passing skills, resulting in the team being stagnant. Another reason must be attributed to KAT's continued poor performance. Although he created many attacking tactics for the former leader in the two games against the Pelicans and the Spurs, Towns' overly predictable ending method also made it difficult for him to cut in when facing a crowded space with the twin towers, either being double-teamed or being disrupted by hurried offenses. From a statistical point of view, among players who cut in more than 7 times per game, KAT has the lowest assist rate in the league at 10%, and the second-highest turnover rate at 13.3%, only slightly better than rookie Henderson. Compared to his peak season in 21-22 (assist rate 24.6%; turnover rate 8.9%), the difference is huge. In short, as long as the Wolves' opponents are sure that KAT will not shoot from the outside and will not be fooled by his three-point fakes, their defensive strategy is to give enough physical confrontation to prevent him from cutting in a crowded space with the twin towers, resulting in either being double-teamed or making fouls due to impatience. When NAW, Big-Mac and others gradually regain their form, I believe that the goal for KAT should be to return to his 2020-21 self. By reducing his cutting-in percentage in the long-term twin towers, increasing the number of outside shots he is good at, it is the most effective way to create space on offense. However, how to achieve a balance on both ends of the court, and how to give up the playing style that allowed himself to rank among the top three teams in the league in 21-22, is a difficult task for the transformed KAT. Important defensive data: rebound rate: 50.5%, ranked 16th in the league. Transition defense: 19.9 possessions (ranked 12th in the league) / 1.13 points per possession, ranked 19th in the league. Opp. Offensive rebounds: 11.5, ranked 15th in the league. The Wolves maintain their \"Match Up\" defense strategy and won a tough battle against the Celtics with high-intensity physical collisions. Instead of returning to the Jazz's old self, Gobert has been reborn in Minnesota. With more abundant defensive resources than the Jazz, the French giant can try more diverse defensive strategies as long as he is healthy. Against the Celtics, he stepped out to defend the perimeter and let his teammates defend the paint, and against the Spurs, he tried zone defense. These all demonstrate the efforts of head coach Finch and assistant coach Turner to make the team's tactics more diverse. However, the zone defense and the defensive strategy that the Wolves have succeeded in this season have fundamentally different purposes and can only be used as a trick to disrupt the opponent's rhythm. Please continue reading. The decrease in focus mentioned on the offensive end is also reflected in the decrease in protection of long rebounds. Slo-Mo, NAW, Reid, and others have once again shown a lack of interest in fighting for rebounds. In addition, KAT's aggressiveness in returning to defense has also declined, but other players have shown improvement in executing assistant coach Corey Williams's principle of transitioning defense. The fact that they can maintain the same defensive mentality after nearly ten games shows that the Wolves can maintain their performance on the defensive end.

In the post-game press conference, he mentioned that this was a first for him in his basketball career. One of the fouls was caused by his teammate Jun-nan, but fortunately, there was no fine or suspension for the preseason game. Lin also talked about his three consecutive three-pointers in the fourth quarter, which caused the crowd to cheer loudly again. The cheers were almost as loud as those for Jeremy Lin, and Lin Li-jen attributed it to the fact that Taiwan has many basketball fans and his last name is also \"Lin,\" so he may have some added cheering support in Taiwan.</p> <p>Jeremy Lin also praised Lin Li-jen's performance today, saying that his three-pointers were beautiful and determined, but he may have gotten too excited and impulsive when he got ejected.

However, the high school basketball league system in Taiwan has remained stagnant, sacrificing the basketball dreams of students.</p> <p>The high school basketball league has been around for over 30 years, and although the format has been slightly adjusted over time, it is still outdated in today's rapidly changing social environment. With issues such as declining birth rates and unequal resource distribution, the high school league system needs a major reform. As seen in the recently concluded HBL qualification games, out of 27 teams participating, 19 were eliminated within a week. This means that nearly 300 students have already ended their season before it even began. Clearly, there is a need for more adjustments in the league format. Furthermore, the narrow qualification criteria for entering the HBL results in unequal distribution of player resources and benefits for those who come out on top.</p> <p>In addition, the limited number of HBL qualification tickets available puts immense pressure on schools to sacrifice their students' academic rights. This includes cutting class time, constant games and training, and even disregarding official regulations for student leave. This creates a vicious cycle of the strong getting stronger and the weak getting weaker.</p> <p>The high school basketball league is marketed as a league, but in reality, it is more like a cup tournament. The one-week schedule determines the outcome of three years of hard work for students. It is like a three-year exam that is decided in one week, putting immense pressure on students and coaches. This \"win or go home\" concept does not promote education. Moreover, the intense schedule of games within a week not only exhausts students physically and mentally, but also ignores the educational purpose behind sports.</p> <p>The issue of foreign student players has also been a hot topic this year, highlighting the unclear responsibilities between the high school sports association and the sports administration. The lack of effective regulations for foreign student players with work visas coming to play in HBL shows that the high school sports association is not keeping up with the times, unlike the college sports association which has implemented regulations for foreign players.</p> <p>The aforementioned issues are just the tip of the iceberg in the high school basketball league. There are many other problems that arise from the inability of the high school sports association to effectively adjust and reform the league format. As an organization responsible for promoting various sports in high schools, the high school sports association also has to handle other sports such as volleyball, softball, soccer, and dance competitions. However, due to the popularity of high school basketball, it is important for the association to focus on establishing a separate organization solely dedicated to organizing high school basketball competitions. This can help avoid overburdening the high school sports association and allow for more efficient changes and improvements in the league system. The organization can also involve more basketball professionals (such as teachers, coaches, or scholars) to provide their expertise and help integrate the league.</p> <p>The establishment of a student basketball league does not aim to replace the current high school basketball league. Rather, it is necessary to have a strong competitor that can provide students with more opportunities to compete and improve their skills. It is not fair for students to only have one chance to compete in HBL in their entire high school career. What is even more tragic is the sacrifice of students' fundamental rights. We need a progressive organization that can continue to promote the development of grassroots basketball, instead of a top-down approach where the voices of grassroots coaches are not heard. It is time for the establishment of a student basketball league.</p>"},{"location":"20231123091146857306/","title":"In today's mid-season tournament, the Trail Blazers led the Grizzlies 33-26 in the first quarter, but the Grizzlies managed to take the lead in the second quarter","text":"<p>In today's mid-season tournament, the Trail Blazers led the Grizzlies 33-26 in the first quarter, but the Grizzlies managed to take the lead in the second quarter.

The 23-year-old Australian, who recently played for the Bay Area Dragons and joined the professional scene in 2022, will join the Kings and compete in the EASL to showcase his skills and help the team challenge in the PBA League.</p> <p>Standing at 198cm, Hayden was born in New South Wales, Australia and attended NCAA Division II West Texas A&amp;M University. In 2022, he joined the Bay Area Dragons in Hong Kong and competed in the PBA League, averaging 13.4 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game with a 40.3% three-point shooting percentage. He also had a career-high of 47 points in a game with 10 three-pointers made, helping the Bay Area Dragons to a runner-up finish in the league. In the previous EASL season, he played 3 games and contributed 9.7 points, 4 rebounds, and a 53% three-point shooting percentage. Known for his excellent physical condition, Hayden recently joined the Bankstown Bears in Australia's NBL1 league, averaging 21.9 points and 10.8 rebounds per game. His sharpshooting and agile off-ball movement will be valuable assets for the Kings in the professional league.</p> <p>After joining the New Taipei Kings, Hayden will compete with the team in 6 EASL group stage games with the goal of helping the team advance to the top 4 and achieve better results. General Manager Mao Jiaen said, \"When Hayden challenged the PBA last year, we noticed that his playing style is very suitable for the Kings' defense. His height and playing style can cover the 2, 3, and even 4 positions, and he is a selfless team player who does not dominate the ball. He will be a great help in creating space for our experienced backcourt players. With the combination of Hayden and the rest of the team, we believe the Kings will have a strong weapon to challenge in the EASL.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231123091228987966/","title":"\u6839\u64da\u6700\u65b0\u5831\u5c0e\uff0cGreen\u9810\u8a08\u5c07\u7f3a\u5e2d36\u500b\u79ae\u62dc\uff0c\u9019\u5c0d\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u4f86\u8aaa\u662f\u4e00\u5927\u6311\u6230\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u7403\u968a\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u7403\u54e1\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u64c1\u6709\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5834\u4e0a\u7d71\u5fa1\u529b\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u7f3a\u5e2d\u5c07\u5c0d\u7403\u968a\u7684\u6230\u529b\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u5c0f\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u5373\u5c07\u5230\u4f86\uff0c\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u5fc5\u9808\u5728\u6c92\u6709Green\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u627e\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u5728\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u6230\u529b\u3002","text":"<p>\u6839\u64da\u6700\u65b0\u5831\u5c0e\uff0cGreen\u9810\u8a08\u5c07\u7f3a\u5e2d36\u500b\u79ae\u62dc\uff0c\u9019\u5c0d\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u4f86\u8aaa\u662f\u4e00\u5927\u6311\u6230\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u7403\u968a\u7684\u95dc\u9375\u7403\u54e1\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u64c1\u6709\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u9632\u5b88\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5834\u4e0a\u7d71\u5fa1\u529b\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u7f3a\u5e2d\u5c07\u5c0d\u7403\u968a\u7684\u6230\u529b\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u5c0f\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u96a8\u8457\u65b0\u8cfd\u5b63\u5373\u5c07\u5230\u4f86\uff0c\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u5fc5\u9808\u5728\u6c92\u6709Green\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4e0b\u627e\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u6c7a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8b93\u7403\u968a\u5728\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u6230\u529b\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231124091131268072/","title":"\u4f46\u662f\u9019\u6b21\uff0c\u52d2\u5e03\u6717\u7684\u4fdd\u8b49\u4e26\u6c92\u6709\u6210\u771f\u3002\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u5728\u7b2c\u4e94\u5834\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5104\u6bd491\u64ca\u6557\u9a0e\u58eb\u968a\uff0c\u596a\u4e0b\u968a\u53f2\u7b2c\u4e00\u5ea7\u7e3d\u51a0\u8ecd\u734e\u76c3\u3002\u9019\u4e5f\u662f\u81ea1975\u5e74\u4ee5\u4f86\uff0c\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u9996\u6b21\u62ff\u4e0b\u7e3d\u51a0\u8ecd\u3002","text":"<p>\u7576\u67ef\u745e\u5c07\u7e3d\u51a0\u8ecd\u734e\u76c3\u9ad8\u8209\uff0c\u52c7\u58eb\u968a\u7403\u8ff7\u6b61\u547c\u8457\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u5973\u5152\u838e\u4f0a\u52d2\uff0e\u67ef\u745e\uff08Riley

World Cup: Germany Reigns Supreme as Undefeated Champions","text":"<p>Semi-final showdown between Germany and five-time world champions United States at the 2023 World Cup witnessed a historic moment as Germany defeated USA to challenge the top spot    2023 World Cup: Germany Reigns Supreme as Undefeated Champions</p> <p>Semi-final showdown between Germany and five-time world champions United States at the 2023 World Cup witnessed a historic moment as Germany defeated USA to challenge the top spot. Their opponent in the final was Serbia, another five-time world champion (referring to World Cup/World Championship).</p> <p>In the 2019 World Cup final, Argentina faced Spain in a closely contested battle. The undefeated German team dominated the first quarter and maintained their lead throughout the game.</p> <p>It was the last game of Argentina's World Cup career for their star player, Luis Scola. However, his performance in this tournament was the worst of the team, and Spain won the championship with a 20-point difference.</p> <p>The dynamics of this year's final were different as Serbia never gave up despite being behind in the third quarter. They even had a chance to tie the game when they were down by three points in the fourth quarter but missed a crucial three-point shot. Germany's Dennis Schroder, once again, showcased his skills by scoring a layup and securing a four-point lead, ultimately sealing the victory. Serbia's coach, Svetislav Pesic, faced a disadvantage when their key defender, Ognjen Dobric, injured his ankle and could not return to the court.</p> <p>Serbia had a deep and talented team, as seen in their semi-final game against Canada, where they used a 10-man rotation. However, without Dobric, they struggled to match up against Germany's tall and strong front line.</p> <p>Losing one player in a high-intensity game makes a significant difference, especially when that player is as impactful as Dobric, who may not have impressive stats but has a strong presence on the court.</p> <p>In the crucial moments of the third quarter, Germany's head coach, Gordon Herbert, boldly used center Johannes Voigtmann to match up against Serbia's main center, Nikola Milutinov. This strategy paid off as Serbia struggled to score inside, allowing Germany to focus on their outside defense. Serbia failed to make any three-pointers in the third quarter, scoring only 10 points, giving Germany a significant advantage.</p> <p>In the fourth quarter, Serbia attempted to make a comeback, led by guard Aleksa Avramovic. However, Germany's defense made it difficult for him to score, and their top scorers, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Milutinov, were also unable to make an impact in the second half. Germany's defense forced Serbia to commit 12 turnovers, and they capitalized on these mistakes, ultimately winning the game. Franz Wagner, with his height, agility, and ability to penetrate the Serbian defense, was a major troublemaker for them. He also had 11 free throw attempts, four offensive rebounds, and three steals, making him the Most Valuable Player of the final game.</p> <p>Schroder's impressive performance throughout the tournament, except for one game against Latvia, where he had a poor shooting night, earned him the MVP of the tournament. He was the heartbeat of the German team, providing consistent scoring and leading the team's offense. He also had a significant impact on the defensive end, making it difficult for Serbia's players to score. Germany's victory marks their first-ever challenge for the world championship, while Serbia has now lost in three consecutive FIBA finals.</p> <p>In the 2014 World Championship final, they lost to the USA, and in the 2016 Rio Olympics, they were once again defeated by the USA. This time, Germany eliminated the USA, but their main players' injuries prevented them from claiming the championship. Apart from the Olympics and the World Cup, Serbia's last EuroBasket championship was in 2001 when they competed as Yugoslavia.</p> <p>Serbia is undoubtedly a basketball powerhouse, but it has been a long time since they have lifted the ultimate trophy in a top FIBA tournament. This could potentially increase Nikola Jokic's chances of representing his country in the Olympics.</p>"},{"location":"20231124091201466614/","title":"2023 Season Analysis of the Los Angeles Clippers at the Crossroads of Rebuilding","text":"<p>\"I know we have disappointed a lot of people    2023 Season Analysis of the Los Angeles Clippers at the Crossroads of Rebuilding</p> <p>\"I know we have disappointed a lot of people. This year will be different, we will definitely make everyone proud.\" These words from Ivica Zubac at the preseason media day may best express the feelings of Clippers fans in recent years.</p> <p>In the fifth year of assembling a luxury warship, the Los Angeles Clippers' season losses have always been used to comfort themselves with injuries as an excuse. \"Imagine if there were no injuries...the Clippers would definitely be on top.\" Last season, after waiting for a whole season, Kawhi Leonard finally returned to the team, but his performance was still disappointing, and the team could only barely make it to the playoffs. In the end, they once again ended their season with the old excuse of \"injuries.\"</p> <p>Please continue reading.</p> <p>With Kawhi Leonard and Paul George both entering their 33rd and 32nd year, and facing upcoming contract negotiations, the dismantling and rebuilding of this team is just around the corner. From Chris Paul all the way to Kawhi Leonard! Looking back at the Clippers' \"curse-like\" history of star injuries [Roster Changes] In: Kobe Brown (first-round pick), Kenyon Martin Jr. (trade), Jordan Miller, Joshua Primo (two-way contracts) Out: Eric Gordon (released), Jason Preston (released) The Clippers had minimal changes this summer. Thanks to the friendly extensions of Russell Westbrook and Mason Plumlee, the team did not lose two important players and maintained almost the same roster. They also acquired Kenyon Martin Jr. from the Rockets through a small trade, adding a young player to the team.</p> <p>The only loss that is a concern is the release of shooter Eric Gordon due to salary pressure.</p> <p>Please continue reading.</p> <p>Key players this season: The league's second-best superstar team If the Phoenix Suns are the team with the most potential to play \"superstar basketball\" next season, I think the Clippers can compete for second place. Ironically, this season will be the second time in five years since this team was formed that we can see a fully healthy Kawhi and George at the start of the season. Despite the fact that in the past four seasons, the two of them have spent almost half of their time on the sidelines, it cannot be denied that as long as they are healthy and on the court, the team's strength is not a concern, and they are still a team that is guaranteed to make it to the playoffs. In last season's playoffs, Kawhi scored 38 and 31 points in two consecutive games against the Suns, proving himself to be a cold-blooded +2 machine. As for George, before he got injured, he also carried the team in the regular season, showing his all-around skills. The two of them make up one of the few power forward combinations in the NBA that possess both size and offensive and defensive abilities. If we add in Russell Westbrook, who averaged 23.6 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game in the playoffs, proving once again his worth as a superstar, there is no doubt that the potential ceiling brought by these three players is enough for people to give the Clippers some respect.</p> <p>Please continue reading.</p> <p>For the Clippers, the optimistic expectation is for the three stars to have a better chemistry. They only played together for a total of 10 games and 230 minutes last season, which is a very small sample size. Compared to the failed partnership between John Wall and Westbrook, Westbrook has a history of playing with star power forwards such as George and Carmelo Anthony, so he is more familiar with playing alongside star forwards and can avoid any negative effects. Even if they cannot achieve the 1+1+1&gt;3 synergy, I believe the worst-case scenario is that it will still be 1+1+1=3.</p> <p>Secondly, both Kawhi and George are versatile forwards who can switch between playing with and without the ball, and can even simply focus on scoring. This is more in line with Kawhi's previous offensive style.</p> <p>Looking at the data, Westbrook is also more willing to adapt to the team's changes in playing style compared to Wall, and is more involved in the team's off-ball offense.</p> <p>According to Synergy data, 36.8% of Westbrook's possessions with the Clippers last season ended in turnovers, fouls, or shots, which is much lower than his 49% ratio with the Lakers and lower than Reggie Jackson's (42.2%) and John Wall's (46.6%) with the Clippers.</p> <p>In addition, the Clippers also have a group of talented guards such as Norman Powell and Bones Hyland, who are all capable of scoring at will. Powell scored 37 points in one game last season, and Hyland also contributed 20 points in one game.</p> <p>If they can fully utilize the star power to attract defenders, and with reasonable rotation, the individual offensive abilities of these five players can create an aggressive and dominant offensive style.</p> <p>This season's weakness: Traditional and undersized depth</p> <p>When head coach Ty Lue showed a five-forward lineup during the 2022-23 preseason, I was looking forward to the \"Forward Sea\" finally coming together. However, it turned out to be just a fleeting moment.</p> <p>Today, the Clippers' current roster is no longer modernized. The two veteran forwards who made up the \"Forward Sea,\" Nicolas Batum and Marcus Morris, are both facing aging and decline in both offense and defense. Batum can no longer play more than 20 minutes per game, and Morris was even benched at the end of last season. Robert Covington, who was seen as a key addition, has not been given much playing time by Ty Lue. Young players like Amir Coffey and Kobe Brown are not ready to fill in, which means the Clippers only have Kawhi and George as their two big wings. If they choose to play with a 3-4 lineup and move Terance Mann to the shooting guard position, their bench will appear weak and undersized.</p> <p>When the Clippers face injuries, Ty Lue can only rely on 195cm Luke Kennard as the shooting guard, or push 185cm Reggie Jackson up to defend against taller and stronger guards in the league, which is obviously a difficult task.</p> <p>Conclusion: This season will be a crucial turning point for the Los Angeles Clippers. Whether it's the stars' contracts, the aging of the roster, or rebuilding the team, they will face their biggest challenge this year. However, if they can overcome these difficulties and regain their stability and competitiveness, they still have a chance to continue rising in this league. So let's look forward to the Clippers' performance in the new season together!</p>"},{"location":"20231124091225841345/","title":"2023 TGF World Fire Fighting Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview: Chi Ping High School","text":"<p>Chi Ping High School has been participating in the TGF Cup since 2021 and ended their journey in the North District qualifier    2023 TGF World Fire Fighting Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview: Chi Ping High School </p> <p>Chi Ping High School has been participating in the TGF Cup since 2021 and ended their journey in the North District qualifier. After a hiatus due to the pandemic in 2022, they made a comeback this year and won the North District and National Championships in the single-school division. Facing strong opponents from all around the country, the team from Chi Ping High School overcame all challenges and even encountered a setback on the first two days of the finals. However, they successfully made adjustments on the third day and found their rhythm again. In the championship game against Kaohsiung High School of Commerce, they achieved sweet revenge and brought the National single-school championship back to the North District for the first time since 2018.</p> <p>Chi Ping High School already had a Division A basketball team, but due to regulations, they were unable to form a team with regular students to participate in the Division B league. However, these passionate basketball players continued to work hard for their love of the sport. The team has been established for about 5 years, with 7 players from the first year and 5 players from the second year this year. Many of them were participating in the TGF Cup for the first time, and this gave the team a completely different style and atmosphere.</p> <p>When asked about the most memorable games from the North District qualifier and National finals, 1st year player Yu Meng-Xun said, \"In the qualifier, we needed to win the game to secure a spot in the top four, but we ended up losing due to our own mistakes. However, in the finals, we had the chance to face Kaohsiung High School of Commerce again and we were able to improve on our previous mistakes. Our three-point shooting percentage also increased, and most importantly, our coach changed our defensive strategy. With adjustments made on both offense and defense, we were able to secure the victory and successfully avenge our previous loss.\"</p> <p>However, Chi Ping High School encountered some difficulties when they arrived at the finals venue and the players admitted that they were too relaxed in the first two games, resulting in a tough win in the first game and a loss in the second game due to too many mistakes. From the third game onwards, they slowly improved and became more aggressive on defense. In the semifinals, they finally reached their expected level and even discussed and analyzed the problems they encountered during the game when they returned to the hotel. With everyone reminding each other and making timely adjustments, as well as their growing cohesion, they were able to ultimately win the championship.</p> <p>In addition, Chen Li-Yu, who won the FMVP in the finals, made a strong impression as he contributed to the team with his excellent offense during crucial moments. Yu Meng-Xun, who won the FMVP in the qualifier and the assist king in the finals, and Zhang En-Qi, who won the steal king, were also major contributors to the team's success. The three of them had great chemistry on the court and were key players in Chi Ping High School's championship victory.</p> <p>Head coach Huang De-Feng, who led the team to victory, also received the award for Best Coach. When asked about his journey this year, he said, \"I am grateful to the TGF Cup for providing a great stage for these young players to showcase and prove themselves. I did not expect us to win the championship this year. Compared to last year, our players' physical conditions and experience were not as good, but the trust, unity, and never-give-up attitude on the court were the most touching and proud moments for me and coach Wu Zheng-Xian. I hope they can pass on this energy to the younger players and continue to improve.\"</p> <p>Finally, Chi Ping High School would like to thank the TGF Cup for providing this platform for their players to be seen. They would also like to give special thanks to the school's chairman and mothers for taking care of their student-athletes and allowing them to focus on training without any worries. They also hope to defend their championship title next year and continue to strive for excellence.</p>"},{"location":"20231124091241388641/","title":"Virtus Segafredo Bologna, one of the top teams in the Italian Basketball League (LBA), recently announced the dismissal of their head coach, Sergio Scariolo (also the current head coach of Spain), and the hiring of Luca Banchi (current head coach of Latvia) as his replacement","text":"<p>Virtus Segafredo Bologna, one of the top teams in the Italian Basketball League (LBA), recently announced the dismissal of their head coach, Sergio Scariolo (also the current head coach of Spain), and the hiring of Luca Banchi (current head coach of Latvia) as his replacement. This decision has caused quite a stir before the start of the new season.</p> <p>The timing of Scariolo's dismissal was surprising, as his relationship with the team has been strained for a long time, with reports of external interference during games. He was also considered a top candidate for the head coaching position of the Toronto Raptors, and even had a video conference with the team while coaching Virtus Bologna in the Italian league finals. The breaking point came when the team's budget was reduced due to the implementation of financial fair play policies in European leagues, forcing Virtus Bologna to let go of several players whose contracts had expired.</p> <p>During a press conference on Wednesday (September 13), Scariolo's words sparked a lot of discussion. He stated that the team's roster decisions were mostly made by the club and refused to answer questions about the team's goals for the new season, suggesting that people should ask the management instead.</p> <p>However, these remarks did not sit well with the majority of the shareholders of Virtus Bologna, leading to the decision to dismiss Scariolo. According to inside sources, almost everyone within the club was in favor of his dismissal. On Friday morning, Virtus Bologna released a statement announcing Scariolo's termination.</p> <p>The statement also pointed out that Scariolo's remarks to the media on September 13, as well as his statements during a press conference on June 27 after the end of the season, were major reasons for his dismissal.</p> <p>Following Scariolo's dismissal, Virtus Bologna quickly announced that they had reached an agreement with Luca Banchi to become the new head coach, signing a two-year contract. Banchi has previously coached multiple teams, including Siena and EA7 Emporio Armani Milan. He also led Latvia to a fifth-place finish at the World Cup this year, earning him the award for Best Coach at the tournament. Interestingly, Banchi's Latvia team had faced Scariolo's Spain in the World Cup, with Latvia ultimately emerging victorious and preventing Spain from advancing to the quarter-finals.

However, Hwang has attracted more attention as he will become the first non-North American NBA full-time referee.</p> <p>Hwang, a native of South Korea, has 15 years of experience as a FIBA referee. He has officiated at the 2016 Rio Olympics and the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Hwang made the decision to pursue his dream in the United States. He was not alone in this journey, as he brought his entire family with him to New Jersey, where they lived while he underwent specialized training to become an NBA referee. The training lasted for 18 months, during which Hwang also had to officiate at amateur league games, although he was paid for this.</p> <p>After completing the 18-month training program, Hwang started officiating G League games. Last year, he officiated in a total of 61 games and was selected as one of the eight NBA officials in reserve, with the opportunity to be called up to officiate NBA games. Now, he has officially become a full-time NBA referee.</p> <p>Becoming an NBA referee took Hwang three and a half years, but it is a dream come true for him. He stated that this has been his dream and goal, to become the best referee in his profession and be chosen by the NBA. He is excited and honored to have this opportunity.</p> <p>In the official announcement by the NBA, it was mentioned that the addition of Hwang and Mitchell will bring more diversity to the league and make them important members of the NBA officiating team. This also demonstrates the NBA's emphasis on diversity and inclusivity, providing referees from different countries the chance to develop their careers at the highest level of basketball in the world.</p>"},{"location":"20231124091310940231/","title":"*\u9032\u653b\u7aef\uff0c\u96f7\u9706\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u9663\u5bb9\u9084\u662f\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5275\u9020\u529b\u8207\u7a69\u5b9a\u6027\u3002","text":"<p>\u4e0a\u5b63\u7684\u96f7\u9706\u4ee5\u591a\u8b8a\u7684\u5c0f\u7403\u9663\u5bb9\u6253\u6eff\u7403\u5b63\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u95dc\u9375\u6642\u523b\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u7f3a\u5c11\u80fd\u5920\u7a69\u5b9a\u638c\u63a7\u5c40\u52e2\u3001\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u5e36\u4f86\u7a69\u5b9a\u9032\u653b\u7684\u4e3b\u529b\u5f8c\u885b\u3002\u9664\u4e86SGA\u4e4b\u5916\uff0cJosh

recently talked to the Manila Times about his thoughts on becoming a leader on the team and his experience consulting Derek Jeter, the captain of the New York Yankees.</p> <p>Kuzma expressed excitement about taking on a new role as a leader in his professional career and said that it is something he has been waiting for his whole life. He also mentioned the challenge of facing the best defenders in the league every game as a starter and the responsibility to contribute to the team on a daily basis. Kuzma sees Washington as a place where he can establish himself as a leader and an all-around player.</p> <p>In preparation for this leadership role, Kuzma said he did a lot of research and consulted Derek Jeter, who spent many years as the captain of the New York Yankees.</p> <p>Kuzma said, \"I got really close with Jeter this summer and asked him a variety of questions. As a leader, you need to have a role model to follow. If you don't do what a leader is supposed to do, how can you expect others to trust and follow you? As a leader, I must focus on my words and actions.\" </p> <p>Kuzma, who signed a 4-year $90 million contract with the Wizards this year, along with a $12 million bonus, will team up with Poole to become the future core of the team. </p>"},{"location":"20231125091133366423/","title":"Bologna Coach Scariolo Criticizes Team Policy, Fired and Replaced by Latvia Coach Banchi","text":"<p>Sergio Scariolo and Luca Banchi    Bologna Coach Scariolo Criticizes Team Policy, Fired and Replaced by Latvia Coach Banchi</p> <p>Sergio Scariolo and Luca Banchi. Photo/FIBA Virtus Segafredo Bologna, one of the top teams in the Italian Basketball League (LBA), recently announced the dismissal of head coach Sergio Scariolo (current head coach of Spain) and the hiring of Luca Banchi (current head coach of Latvia) as his replacement, causing quite a stir before the start of the new season.</p> <p>Scariolo's firing came as a surprise to many, as his relationship with the team has been strained for a long time, with reports of constant interference from outside sources during games. He was considered a top candidate for the head coach position of the Toronto Raptors and even had a video conference with them during the Italian league championship series while still serving as Bologna's head coach. However, things took a turn when the team's budget was significantly reduced due to the implementation of financial fair play policies in European leagues, leading to the departure of several players after their contracts expired.</p> <p>During a press conference on Wednesday (September 13), Scariolo's words sparked a lot of discussion. He stated that the team's roster decisions were mostly made by the club and refused to answer any questions about the upcoming season, stating that those should be directed to the management.</p> <p>However, most of Bologna's shareholders were unhappy with his statements and decided to dismiss the coach. According to sources within the club, it was almost unanimously agreed upon that Scariolo would be fired. On Friday morning, Bologna released a press release announcing Scariolo's dismissal.</p> <p>The press release also pointed out that Scariolo's statements to the media on September 13, 2023, and during a press conference on June 27 after the end of the season were significant factors in his dismissal.</p> <p>Following Scariolo's dismissal, Bologna quickly announced an agreement with Luca Banchi to become their new head coach, signing a two-year contract. Banchi has previously served as head coach for various teams, including Siena and EA7 Emporio Armani Milan. This year, he led Latvia to a fifth-place finish at the World Cup and was awarded the Best Coach award. Interestingly, Latvia, led by Banchi, had faced Scariolo's Spain in the World Cup and ultimately emerged victorious, knocking Spain out of the quarter-finals. This unexpected change in the European basketball coaching scene has sparked widespread discussion.</p>"},{"location":"20231125091139557839/","title":"\u4e2d\u83ef\u7537\u7c43\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5ffd\u8996\u7684\u9583\u96fb\u5f27\u7dda\uff0c\u8b1d\u4e9e\u8ed2\u624d\u662f\u6211\u5011\u8981\u7684\u5c04\u624b\u57fa\u56e0\u3002\u5728\u73fe\u4eca\u7684\u7c43\u7403\u74b0\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c04\u624b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5ffd\u8996\uff0c\u800c\u8b1d\u4e9e\u8ed2\u6b63\u662f\u5177\u6709\u512a\u7570\u7684\u5c04\u624b\u57fa\u56e0\u3002\u4ed6\u64c5\u9577\u8dd1\u4f4d\uff0c\u51fa\u624b\u901f\u5ea6\u6975\u5feb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u65b0\u5317\u4e2d\u4fe1\u7279\u653b\u968a\u64d4\u4efb\u4e3b\u529b\u5c04\u624b\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u7684\u6bd4\u8cfd\u4e2d\u66fe\u906d\u9047\u50b7\u75c5\u56f0\u64fe\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u676d\u5dde\u4e9e\u904b\u524d\u537b\u672a\u53c3\u8207\u4efb\u4f55\u6b63\u5f0f\u6bd4\u8cfd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u7403\u968a\u5167\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\u4e26\u4e0d\u7a69\u56fa\u3002","text":"<p>\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u676d\u5dde\u4e9e\u904b\u8cfd\u5834\u4e0a\uff0c\u8b1d\u4e9e\u8ed2\u5c55\u73fe\u51fa\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u5be6\u529b\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u5728\u5c0f\u7d44\u8cfd\u4e2d\u4e26\u672a\u7372\u5f97\u592a\u591a\u4e0a\u5834\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u6b21\u4e0a\u5834\u90fd\u80fd\u5728\u95dc\u9375\u6642\u523b\u7d66\u7403\u968a\u5e36\u4f86\u653b\u64ca\u529b\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u8eab\u9ad8\u4e26\u4e0d\u51fa\u773e\uff0c\u4f46\u537b\u5177\u6709\u81bd\u8b58\u548c\u6230\u8853\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9019\u6b63\u662f\u4e2d\u83ef\u968a\u5728\u4e8c\u865f\u4f4d\u6025\u9700\u586b\u88dc\u7684\u7a7a\u7f3a\u3002</p>

After a long wait, the highly anticipated PLG opened the new season with a warm-up match in Keelung, the northernmost city of Taiwan    PLG Report - Unexpected Return of Walker, Full-Strength Warm-up Battle Between Lions and Dreamers</p> <p>PLG is back! After a long wait, the highly anticipated PLG opened the new season with a warm-up match in Keelung, the northernmost city of Taiwan. This is also a great opportunity for teams to test out their newly strengthened lineups during the summer break. Let's continue reading for the first match between the Hsinchu Lions and the Formosa Dreamers.</p> <p>Starting lineup for the Lions: Chu Yun-hao, Kao Kuo-hao, Wang Tzu-kang, Clark, Coach Ou</p> <p>Starting lineup for the Dreamers: Lu Kuan-liang, Lin Chun-ji, Qian Kenney, Bezaneshvili, McCallum</p> <p>Observations on Coach Ou</p> <p>Although Coach Ou did not have many offensive opportunities, his ability to read the court was evident as he directed the newly joined Clark to find open teammates. While he didn't show any particularly impressive moves on offense, it was clear that Coach Ou is a team-oriented player. With the partnership of Brown, he is expected to have a great season, but he will also have to work harder to secure his spot in the team midway through the season. However, based on his performance in this game, he is a player that I personally like and I am looking forward to seeing him play in the new season.</p> <p>On the defensive end, Coach Ou's solid build allowed him to protect the rim and rebound well against the undersized McCallum and Bezaneshvili. It will be interesting to see if he is suitable for a smaller lineup.</p> <p>The Return of Walker</p> <p>After a season of rest, Walker finally returned to the court with his hustle and energy. He fought for offensive rebounds and even if he couldn't make the first shot, he made it difficult for his opponents to defend him. If he can return to full strength this season, his partnership with Qian Kenney will continue to give opponents headaches in the backcourt. Clark's exceptional performance on both ends of the court</p> <p>As someone who has been following the BIG 3 league for a while, I am quite familiar with Earl Clark. Although I haven't kept up with his NBA career, it's not a coincidence that he was named the Defensive Player of the Year in the BIG 3 for two consecutive years. His long wingspan, excellent defensive reads, and impressive physical abilities make him a valuable contributor on the court. In addition to his increased use of mid-range shots, his success rate on open three-point shots in this game is a big confidence boost for Lions fans.</p> <p>Coach Lin expressed in the post-game press conference that Clark has only practiced with the team three times, but his great physical condition and discipline allowed him to quickly integrate into the team. We can expect to see his performance in the regular season and see if he can challenge for the title of the best import player. He will also be a key player in leading the Lions to victory.</p> <p>The Success of the Lions' 5-out Motion Offense and the Struggle of the Single Import Player</p> <p>In the first quarter, the Lions experimented with a 5-out motion offense, with cuts to the basket and rotations, which worked well. However, it could just be an experiment and we will have to continue to observe.</p> <p>In the second quarter, when they only had one import player on the court, the Lions struggled on defense as they couldn't contain the Dreamers' imports. This is an area they will need to work on, especially when they have a smaller lineup.</p> <p>The Return of Bu Yi-de</p> <p>Bu Yi-de, who played for SBL's Changhua Bank last season, returned to the Dreamers this season. Although he only played for less than 10 minutes in this game, I am looking forward to seeing his performance. After experiencing the single import player system in the SBL, returning to a dual import player system and playing with familiar teammates may give him more opportunities to showcase his skills and make the competition for the four import spots more intense. The Dreamers' 2-3 Zone Defense with Player Marking</p> <p>The Dreamers used a 2-3 zone defense with player marking when facing the Lions without any import ball handlers. This effectively neutralized their cutting and passing offense and forced them to take difficult three-point shots. With the addition of Qian Kenney, this defense will be even more formidable with the protection of Gilbeck.</p> <p>The Surprising Performance of the Local Lineup</p> <p>In the post-game press conference, Coach Lin mentioned that due to some of the imports having physical discomfort, they were limited to 15 minutes of playing time. As a result, the Lions played almost the entire second half with a full local lineup. To everyone's surprise, they played extremely well, with everyone sharing the ball and putting in effort on defense. This shows the team's great chemistry and determination for the new season. Coach Lin repeatedly praised their performance and mentioned that with better offensive execution, they will be a strong contender this season.</p> <p>Outstanding Players of the Game</p>"},{"location":"20231125091215579583/","title":"Toronto Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry stated during media day that he has no worries about the new rules against flopping, and that he doesn't fake fouls","text":"<p>Toronto Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry stated during media day that he has no worries about the new rules against flopping, and that he doesn't fake fouls.

This number is especially scary for a professional athlete.</p> <p>The NBA official social media team asked James about being the league's oldest player, to which he responded with a cartoonish scream and then proceeded to easily score a dunk in a simulated game. \u263bPlease continue reading for James' reaction to being considered the oldest player in the league: https://x.com/NBA/status/1710053275750244726?s=20</p> <p>Howard Beck explains that it is extremely rare for any professional athlete to play in their 21st season.</p> <p>What James is attempting to do now is unprecedented in the NBA. Playing at a high level for a team like the Los Angeles Lakers is a challenge for young players, but for a 39-year-old veteran, it is even more difficult.</p> <p>At least James was able to do it at 37 and 38, especially in the second half of last season when the Lakers made an incredible run and advanced to the Western Conference Finals.</p> <p>Howard Beck describes it as the best performance in the 20th season by any veteran in NBA history.</p> <p>Now entering his 21st season, James joins the likes of Robert Parish, Kevin Willis, Vince Carter, Kevin Garnett, and Dirk Nowitzki as the sixth player to reach this milestone, and he is still a starting member of the Lakers.</p> <p>No one doubts his ambition to compete for a championship, and he is still in the running for league MVP, with his veteran skills giving us goosebumps just thinking about it, right? Please continue reading to see James' recent performance and how it translates to this season. In his first season with the Lakers, James played 55 out of 82 games, and in the shortened 2020-2021 season, he played 45 out of 72 games. In the past two seasons, he played 56 and 55 games respectively, but still managed to maintain impressive averages of 28.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 6.8 assists. Unfortunately, his numbers took a hit in the second half of last season due to a foot injury, with a decrease of 4 points per game and a 6% drop in three-point shooting, yet he still averaged 24.5 points, 9.9 rebounds, and 6.5 assists per game.</p> <p>Therefore, it is necessary for the coaching staff to adjust and ensure that this veteran stays healthy and performs well in the playoffs, otherwise, there is a risk of a repeat of last season's decline, which could affect the Lakers' chances at a championship. In addition to his own performance, James is also a mentor on the Lakers team, guiding the young players on the team. Rookie Rui Hachimura, who joined the team in a trade last season, has been training with the superstar every day. James says, \"My relationship with Rui Hachimura is like the relationship between Daniel-san and Mr. Miyagi in the movie \"The Karate Kid\", passing on my skills to him.\"</p> <p>Normally, we wouldn't expect much from a 39-year-old player, but this is LeBron James we are talking about. From every perspective, he has no intention of retiring and still has a strong desire to win.</p> <p>Please continue reading for James' interview where he says, \"I never consider being mentally and physically tired because once you start thinking about it, it will actually happen. Fatigue only exists in your mind. If you tell yourself you're tired, your body will feel tired. I don't have this thought, so I don't feel tired handling a long season.\" In any case, this is not just a 21-season veteran, but a once in a lifetime prodigy.

In October of last year, the Warriors and Jordan Poole completed an early contract extension, successfully negotiating a four-year, $140 million deal with $123 million in guaranteed money and an additional $17 million in incentives. Without the incentives, his salary for the 2023-24 season will be $27.45 million, accounting for about 20.5% of the team's salary cap. Please continue reading</p> <p>Originally seen as the Warriors' future star, Poole's signing of a four-year contract seemed to be to take over from Stephen Curry. However, after signing the contract, both the media and most fans outside of the Warriors' own media did not understand their decision. The Warriors were already being crushed by their high team salary, and the penalties for repeated luxury tax violations were also coming. In addition, the rift between Poole and Draymond Green caused endless speculation. This also meant that after signing the contract, Poole was destined to face harsh scrutiny.</p> <p>As expected, Poole received a lot of attention from the public during the 2022-23 season, from the difference in his performance as a starter and off the bench, to his shot selection and relationship with teammates on the court. The media was always able to take things out of context and focus on the conflicts, constantly accusing Poole of not being able to live up to his $30 million future value and lacking leadership qualities.</p> <p>What's more, Poole's underwhelming performance in the playoffs was the talk of the town. It was a far cry from the previous year when he helped the Warriors win the championship. His stats significantly declined and the Warriors were on the brink of elimination, with Poole being blamed for not playing well. He was described by the media as a high-paid big trash, similar to Russell Westbrook's situation with the Lakers in the past. Eventually, in a trade involving Chris Paul, as the public hoped, he was shipped out as a high-paid liability.</p> <p>Please continue reading From being a future star on a championship team to becoming the transitional mainstay on a rebuilding team.</p> <p>In his new life with the Wizards, it is without a doubt that Poole's progress or regression will be closely monitored. After Bradley Beal was traded, Jordan Poole became the strongest scorer in the Wizards' backcourt. He is expected to be the first or second option on the team with Kyle Kuzma. It is foreseeable that he will be a stable starter. In the past with the Warriors, he was mostly the third or fourth option on offense. Can he handle such a big responsibility now that he's in Washington? The biggest issue with Poole's offense is his high number of turnovers. He averaged 3.1 turnovers per game, second only to Stephen Curry's 3.2. However, his total number of turnovers is much higher. Last season, he had a total of 252 turnovers, ranking fourth in the league. This was still with the support of a mature offensive system with the Warriors. Without reliable teammates to share the burden of opposing defenses, Poole is easily pressured and prone to turnovers.</p> <p>If he continues to play the same way with the Wizards as he did with the Warriors, without reliable players to set screens for him, Poole will be even more heavily targeted. Daniel Gafford is not an ideal pick-and-roll partner, but the Wizards don't have better options. The only other options are the older Mike Muscala and Taj Gibson. The environment is quite hostile. Although the Warriors have been training Poole to handle the ball for longer periods of time in recent years, in order to prepare him to eventually take over Curry's position, they didn't have much time to let him make mistakes and learn. Under the pressure of being on a championship team, Poole's ball-handling skills did not progress smoothly. His dribbling is flashy, but he often holds onto the ball for too long, which can disrupt the team's offensive flow. When he dribbles the ball three to six times before taking a shot, his two-point field goal percentage is 45.8%. When he dribbles the ball more than seven times before taking a shot, his field goal percentage is 47%. This may look decent, but his field goal attempts with 0-2 dribbles account for over 50% of his shots, and his efficiency decreases when he dribbles more than three times, which is one of the reasons for his inconsistent offensive performance.</p> <p>With a lot of time handling the ball, his efficiency in isolation is not high. Coupled with being pressured by opponents, his poor passing becomes a major issue on the offensive end. However, there is still hope for a turnaround by having Jordan Poole focus on being the team's primary scorer. Newly acquired point guard Tyus Jones, who came from the Grizzlies, will be Poole's most important partner next season. Compared to Poole, who has only been developing his ball-handling skills in recent years, Jones has been playing point guard for the past eight years. Although he didn't have many minutes on the court, his assist numbers were quite low. However, when looking at his assist-to-turnover ratio, he was often in the top rankings. His composed ball-handling is his signature, and there were rumors last year that the Wizards were interested in acquiring him. This year, they finally succeeded. The chemistry between Jones and Poole, who will be the starting backcourt for the Wizards next season, will greatly affect the team's performance in the first half of the season. </p>"},{"location":"20231126091152738276/","title":"SBL Weekly Exposes Former SBL Player Wu Jiying Betting on Fake Games and Secretly Dating Yulon Princess, Selling Yan's Watches","text":"<p>October 17, 2023 - According to Mirror Weekly, former SBL (Super Basketball League) player Wu Jiying, who played for Yulon Luxgen last season, quietly left the team in June to join Taiwan Beer    SBL Weekly Exposes Former SBL Player Wu Jiying Betting on Fake Games and Secretly Dating Yulon Princess, Selling Yan's Watches</p> <p>October 17, 2023 - According to Mirror Weekly, former SBL (Super Basketball League) player Wu Jiying, who played for Yulon Luxgen last season, quietly left the team in June to join Taiwan Beer. The magazine received a tip that Wu is suspected of participating in fake games and has been cooperating with bookies for a long time. He can earn at least 300,000 to 500,000 NT dollars per game, allowing him to drive a Mercedes-Benz and live in a luxury house. In addition, there are rumors that he is in a relationship with Yulon Group's \"Little Princess\" Yan Peiyu. What's even more shocking is that he sold three watches from the collection of former Yulon chairman Yan Kaitai, and even resold two of them, causing the top management to be furious and sending people to buy back the watches. This outrageous behavior has sent shockwaves through the domestic basketball world, raising questions about whether there is match-fixing in the SBL and the internal management of the team. So far, the organizing committee and Yulon team have not responded.</p> <p>Wu Jiying, 25, graduated from the prestigious basketball high school, Nanshan High School in New Taipei City. In the 104th school year, he helped the school win the championship in the HBL (High School Basketball League) and was named the FMVP, gaining fame. He joined the Fu Jen University basketball team during college and was named the UBA (University Basketball Association) Rookie of the Year in his freshman year. In 2020, he was selected in the second round of the SBL draft by Taoyuan Pauian, joined the T1 League's Taoyuan Leopards in October 2021, and returned to Yulon Basketball Team in August 2022. He is currently a player for Taiwan Beer.</p>"},{"location":"20231126091159064781/","title":"against the Mongolian team during the group stage of the Asia Basketball Championship.\"Coach Sun Man-Sun: Key to Victory Against Mongolia in Final Battle of Asia Basketball Championship\"","text":"<p>The Final Battle of the Asia Basketball Championship is Must-Win Against Mongolia, Coach Sun Man-Sun Points Out the Key</p> <p>2023-09-28 23:14 United Daily News / Special Reporter Zeng Si-Ru / Hangzhou Instant Report Chinese team's Liu Zheng scored a basket </p> <p>The Final Battle of the Asia Basketball Championship is Must-Win Against Mongolia, Coach Sun Man-Sun Points Out the Key</p> <p>2023-09-28 23:14 United Daily News / Special Reporter Zeng Si-Ru / Hangzhou Instant Report Chinese team's Liu Zheng scored a basket.</p> <p>Special reporter Ji Xiang-Ru / photography related to the key battle for the top spot in the group in the men's basketball competition at the Hangzhou Asian Games, although the Chinese team had the ability to resist the host's tall lineup inside, their perimeter defense was breached, as the mainland team hit 15 three-pointers and eventually suffered their first defeat with a score of 69:89. In the final group match, the Chinese team must win against Mongolia to secure the second place in the group. Team captain Zeng Wen-Ding directly called for a \"must-win order\", and head coach Sun Man-Sun also pointed out the key points. Sun Man-Sun mentioned that today's opponent, the mainland team, had an absolute height advantage. Throughout the game, the Chinese team focused on protecting the inside, but they missed many defensive rebounds, allowing the host to grab offensive rebounds and convert them into outside attacks. He added, \"Our biggest problem is that every player is being marked when we try to create opportunities, so the chances are not so good.\"</p> <p>Despite losing by 20 points, Sun Man-Sun still praised the Chinese team's fighting spirit, but there is still room for improvement in defensive communication and rotations. There are 16 teams participating in the men's basketball competition at the Asian Games, divided into 4 groups in the preliminary round. The group winner will advance directly to the quarter-finals, and the second and third place teams in each group will compete for the remaining 4 spots in the quarter-finals. In the Chinese team's final group match, they will face Mongolia, and a win will secure the second place in the group.</p> <p>The Chinese team doesn't have much knowledge about Mongolia, but they have done their homework based on Mongolia's previous match against the mainland. Sun Man-Sun believes that their opponent will have good mobility and a positive attitude in the next game, and the Chinese team's disadvantage in height today will become an advantage in the next game. To win against Mongolia, they need to defend the rebound well and have a chance to play the Chinese team's strength in transition attacks. Mongolia will face Hong Kong at the same time tonight, and they suffered their second defeat with a score of 64:69, allowing Hong Kong, who replaced Lebanon in the Asian Games, to start with a victory. Currently, both Hong Kong and the Chinese team have a record of 1 win and 1 loss. In terms of strength, it will be difficult for Hong Kong to shake the host in the final match, which means that the Chinese team, who defeated Hong Kong in their first match, has almost secured the second place in the group in advance.</p>"},{"location":"20231126091209499328/","title":". However, injuries to key players hindered their chances of making a deep run in the playoffs. With a healthy roster and key additions, the Nuggets have a clear path to defending their title in the 2023-24 NBA season.","text":"<p>Exploring Denver Nuggets' Path to Defending their Title in the 2023-24 NBA Season</p> <p>Looking back at the 2020-21 season, the Nuggets made a mid-season trade with the Magic for Aaron Gordon, elevating their team to new heights after reaching the Western Conference Finals in the bubble </p> <p>Exploring Denver Nuggets' Path to Defending their Title in the 2023-24 NBA Season</p> <p>Looking back at the 2020-21 season, the Nuggets made a mid-season trade with the Magic for Aaron Gordon, elevating their team to new heights after reaching the Western Conference Finals in the bubble.</p> <p>However, things took a turn for the worse when star player Jamal Murray suffered an Achilles injury during a regular season game against the Warriors, forcing him to miss the entire season. The Nuggets also struggled with injuries to another key player, Michael Porter Jr., making it difficult for Jokic to carry the team on his own. As a result, they fell short in the playoffs.</p> <p>But perhaps the Nuggets' patience with their players' injuries paid off, as they proved to be a dominant force in the regular season. They held onto the top spot in the Western Conference and were able to rest their players towards the end of the season. In the playoffs, they swept the Lakers and \"gentleman swept\" the Heat in the Finals, bringing home their first championship in franchise history since 1967-68. </p> <p>Now, as the team looks ahead to the new season, they have some changes in their roster and will need to adapt to remain competitive. Let's take a look at some key changes and factors to watch for.</p> <p>Due to their limited salary cap space, the Nuggets were not able to retain key players like Bruce Brown, who was crucial in bolstering their front line last season. Brown had the highest defensive win shares (DWS) of 2.6, second only to Jokic, and his defensive prowess was invaluable for the Nuggets, especially with Murray and Porter Jr.'s weaker defense. However, Brown ultimately signed with the Pacers for a 2-year, $45 million deal.</p> <p>With most of their key players locked into long-term contracts, the Nuggets had limited flexibility in the free agency market. They were only able to sign Reggie Jackson from the Clippers and Justin Holiday to add depth to their front line. But will these moves be enough to fill the void left by Brown's departure and maintain their competitiveness? </p> <p>Reggie Jackson will likely serve as insurance for the second unit, but his declining offensive efficiency may limit his playing time. In fact, he saw a decrease in minutes during the playoffs and had a career-low effective field goal percentage (eFG%) of 45.7% in his 16 games with the Nuggets. </p> <p>This opens up opportunities for rookies like Jalen Pickett, who was selected by the Nuggets in the second round of the draft. Pickett has shown promise in scoring and playmaking abilities, and his solid three-point shooting in college (38.1%) may earn him playing time in his first season. </p> <p>Furthermore, with Vlatko Cancar out due to an Achilles injury, the Nuggets will need to find a suitable replacement for the power forward position when Gordon is off the court. Zeke Nnaji, who spent 77% of his playing time at the center position last season, may have to step up and fill in the gap. Other options include rookies Hunter Tyson and Julian Strawther, but both have their limitations. Tyson lacks defensive skills, while Strawther needs to improve his reading on defense and physical condition to earn playing time.</p> <p>One of the biggest challenges for the Nuggets in the past few seasons was Jokic's inconsistency in the playoffs. However, last season, he proved to be not only a dominant force on the court but also a stable leader. In the playoffs, Jokic averaged 26.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 5.2 assists in 33.8 minutes per game, and he was able to step up in crucial moments to lead the team to victory. With Jokic's leadership and a strong core lineup, the Nuggets will continue to be a formidable team in the upcoming season.</p> <p>In conclusion, although the Nuggets did not make any major moves this summer, they have a stable leader and a strong core lineup, making them a force to be reckoned with in the new season.</p>"},{"location":"20231126091224909963/","title":"NBA Raises Record, Shaq and LeBron Aim to Set New Scoring Records by 6070","text":"<p>Former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal made an appearance on a show today to share his thoughts on the Lakers' current season, as well as to comment on LeBron James' 21st season   NBA Raises Record, Shaq and LeBron Aim to Set New Scoring Records by 6070</p> <p>Former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal made an appearance on a show today to share his thoughts on the Lakers' current season, as well as to comment on LeBron James' 21st season.

As human beings, we tend to get tired of the same old things, and the NBA is no exception. In order to please the fans, the switch in hardware design is also to stimulate their visual senses and avoid the lack of interest that comes with watching the same thing for years. Please continue reading as we shift the focus back to the players' performances on the court, which is what fans love to see. Each game has its own highlights, whether it's a dunk, an incredible long-range shot, a dazzling dribble, or a spectacular block. These moments are often made into short videos by the NBA or passionate fans and shared on social media.</p> <p>Draymond Green, the master of basketball fighting, has been causing quite a stir recently. But his potential on the basketball court goes beyond that. Please continue reading as we discuss Green's controversial actions and how he constantly pushes the boundaries of what is possible on the court, attracting a lot of attention. Aside from his passionate plays, Green is often seen arguing with referees and getting ejected from the game.</p> <p>In a recent game between the Warriors and the Timberwolves, a confrontation broke out between players after Warriors' Klay Thompson was pulled by an opponent at mid-court. Green, in a swift and unexpected move, used a wrestling move called a chokehold on Rudy Gobert, which completely changed the tone of the game.</p> <p>After the incident, Green, along with two other players, was ejected from the game. Due to Green's past reputation, the NBA held a meeting and decided to increase his punishment. He was suspended for 5 games and fined $769,704 (approximately 24.64 million NT dollars) in lost salary.</p> <p>Many fans were left confused after seeing the footage and wondered what could have happened for Green to react in such a way.</p> <p>Some people even made memes and jokes about Green's out-of-control behavior, making NBA fans chuckle.</p> <p>Could it be that Green's recent violent actions on the court are a sign of his shift towards a different career path? Including the punch he threw at Poole in a previous game, Green has a reputation for being a player who often loses control and gets carried away. This is also how most people perceive him. However, on the other hand, Green's unpredictable behavior has also brought a different kind of attention to the game, sometimes even making it more interesting. For example, Shaquille O'Neal imitating Green's chokehold on Charles Barkley on a show, or the recent memes circulating online, are evidence of this. Just like life, we try to control all the variables and hope to move forward smoothly. But many facts and the way society works don't always go as planned, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict or the recent Israel-Palestine conflict. We all hope for peace, but sometimes unfortunate things happen. While Green may have emotional management issues, it has also become a defining characteristic and a memorable aspect of his career. Some sports commentators have even said that if you go to a Warriors game, besides wanting to see the Splash Brothers' incredible three-point shots, you also want to see Draymond Green get into a fight.</p> <p>Following the logic of capitalism, Green's image as a physical player, both on and off the court, and his role as a podcaster, may have slowly paved the way for new career opportunities. Maybe one day, we will see Green step into the ring as a fighter, and it won't be surprising or out of place at all, but rather something we might even look forward to.

In the first half, the War Gods were still trailing 33:36. With 5 and a half minutes left in the third quarter, they launched an 11:1 offensive to take the lead. Lin Ping-Sheng scored 9 points in this offensive. In the final quarter, Taiwan Beer found their rhythm, with Yang Tian-You and Wang Xin-Wei's consecutive three-pointers helping the team regain the lead. In the last 23 seconds, Taiwan Beer's guard Cao Xun-Xiang was called out, and Wang Hao-Ji made a free throw before hitting a last-second three-pointer from the corner, allowing Taiwan Beer to lead 58:51 at the end of the third quarter. However, in the fourth quarter, the War Gods scored 29 points and completed a comeback victory over Taiwan Beer. Lin Ping-Sheng has scored the highest in two consecutive games and with his current popularity, he has the aura of a team's top player. War Gods' American head coach Brian Adams also said that Lin Ping-Sheng has a leadership presence off the court and his dominance on the court can inspire his teammates. He is definitely an important player on the team and one of the leaders. However, we are a team and we don't emphasize individual players. Everyone can lead the team.</p> <p>Lin Ping-Sheng agreed and said that every teammate is important. \"A good team doesn't have a top player. If a team only has one top player, they can't win a championship.\" He also named each teammate, including Liu Yan-Ting's defense, Lin Li-Quan's pressure on the court, and Cao Xun-Xiang's leadership. Everyone played a crucial role in today's comeback victory and he hopes that they can continue to showcase their strengths and help the team.</p> <p>Cao Xun-Xiang, who received a technical foul today, played for Taiwan Beer's Yulon last season. He said that there is no animosity playing against his former teammates, but he has some opinions on the unfavorable calls from the referees. He admitted that he may have overreacted, leading to his ejection. He also mentioned that the new coach has only been with the team for about two weeks and they haven't had much time to work on team chemistry. Right now, they are just playing the game and need to continue to build chemistry with their new teammates.</p>"},{"location":"20231201091213335008/","title":"Theis\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u5fb7\u570b\u7c4d\u4e2d\u92d2\uff0c\u51fa\u751f\u65bc1992\u5e744\u67084\u65e5\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad86\u82f1\u5c3a8\u82f1\u5bf8\uff0c\u9ad4\u91cd245\u78c5\u3002\u4ed6\u57282017\u5e74\u52a0\u5165NBA\uff0c\u66fe\u6548\u529b\u65bc\u585e\u723e\u7dad\u4e9e\u806f\u8cfd\u7684Brose Bamberg\u3002\u4ed6\u57282018-2019\u8cfd\u5b63\u52a0\u5165\u6ce2\u58eb\u9813\u585e\u723e\u63d0\u514b\uff0c\u4e26\u57282021\u5e74\u88ab\u4ea4\u6613\u81f3\u829d\u52a0\u54e5\u516c\u725b\u3002","text":"<p>\u5feb\u8247\u76f8\u4fe1Theis\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\u5167\u7dda\u9632\u5b88\u548c\u7c43\u677f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u9032\u653b\u7aef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e9b\u5f97\u5206\u3002\u4ed6\u5c07\u8207\u5feb\u8247\u7684\u524d\u92d2\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u52aa\u529b\u722d\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u4e0a\u5834\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u5e6b\u52a9\u7403\u968a\u5728\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\u3002</p> <p>Theis\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u5c07\u70ba\u5feb\u8247\u5e36\u4f86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u9078\u64c7\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u4ed6\u80fd\u5728\u5feb\u8247\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u6a5f\u6703\u3002\u52a0\u5165\u5feb\u8247\u7684Theis\u4e5f\u5c07\u6210\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u7684\u4e00\u54e1\uff0c\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u7684\u52dd\u5229\u800c\u52aa\u529b\u3002   Theis\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u5fb7\u570b\u7c4d\u4e2d\u92d2\uff0c\u51fa\u751f\u65bc1992\u5e744\u67084\u65e5\uff0c\u8eab\u9ad86\u82f1\u5c3a8\u82f1\u5bf8\uff0c\u9ad4\u91cd245\u78c5\u3002\u4ed6\u57282017\u5e74\u52a0\u5165NBA\uff0c\u66fe\u6548\u529b\u65bc\u585e\u723e\u7dad\u4e9e\u806f\u8cfd\u7684Brose Bamberg\u3002\u4ed6\u57282018-2019\u8cfd\u5b63\u52a0\u5165\u6ce2\u58eb\u9813\u585e\u723e\u63d0\u514b\uff0c\u4e26\u57282021\u5e74\u88ab\u4ea4\u6613\u81f3\u829d\u52a0\u54e5\u516c\u725b\u3002</p> <p>\u5feb\u8247\u76f8\u4fe1Theis\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\u5167\u7dda\u9632\u5b88\u548c\u7c43\u677f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u9032\u653b\u7aef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e9b\u5f97\u5206\u3002\u4ed6\u5c07\u8207\u5feb\u8247\u7684\u524d\u92d2\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u52aa\u529b\u722d\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u4e0a\u5834\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u5e6b\u52a9\u7403\u968a\u5728\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6210\u529f\u3002</p> <p>Theis\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u5c07\u70ba\u5feb\u8247\u5e36\u4f86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u9078\u64c7\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u4ed6\u80fd\u5728\u5feb\u8247\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u6a5f\u6703\u3002\u52a0\u5165\u5feb\u8247\u7684Theis\u4e5f\u5c07\u6210\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u7684\u4e00\u54e1\uff0c\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u7684\u52dd\u5229\u800c\u52aa\u529b\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231201091219432141/","title":"Liu Zheng scores 10 points in the last quarter to stabilize the situation as the Chinese men's basketball team defeated Hong Kong at the start of the Hangzhou Asian Games basketball event","text":"<p>Liu Zheng scores 10 points in the last quarter to stabilize the situation as the Chinese men's basketball team defeated Hong Kong at the start of the Hangzhou Asian Games basketball event.</p> <p>Photo/Basketball Note</p> <p>The Hangzhou Asian Games basketball event began today with 16 teams participating. The Chinese team was assigned to Group B, along with China, Mongolia, and Hong Kong. The Chinese team struggled a little at the beginning, but quickly found their rhythm and pulled ahead with a double-digit lead. Although they encountered some small disturbances on the offensive end in the second half, they were still able to overcome them smoothly. Liu Zheng scored 10 points in the last quarter to solidify the team's victory. The Chinese men's basketball team had a successful start to the tournament.</p> <p>In the first few minutes of the game, the Chinese team did not seem to be in their best form. However, the high-low combination of Atino and Zeng Wendin in the paint, as well as Lu Junxiang's three-pointer, helped break the deadlock for the Chinese team. Following that, Liu Zheng and Lin Tingqian also scored consecutively, quickly widening the gap to over ten points. The Chinese team's defense put pressure on Hong Kong's guards in the frontcourt, causing them to make many mistakes. In the second quarter, the Chinese team's scoring was concentrated in the first half. In the second half, their shooting percentage was limited, and the score did not widen.</p> <p>In the second half, Hong Kong showed more patience in handling each possession, and their guard Xu Yuanzheng (No.24) stood out by scoring multiple times. Meanwhile, the Chinese team relied on the small group combination of Zeng Wendin and Abasi, as well as Li Qiwei's three-pointers and Atino's presence in the paint, to stabilize their offensive firepower.</p> <p>In the final quarter, Hong Kong's Huilong'er (No.11) performed well, making several three-point shots and causing communication errors in the Chinese team's defense. At the start of the fourth quarter, the Chinese team only scored 8 points and Atino was also ejected after receiving multiple fouls within a short period of time. Hong Kong closed the gap to a 15-point difference.</p> <p>Fortunately, the Chinese team's main player Liu Zheng took charge in the closing stage, single-handedly scoring 10 points and two three-pointers, completely crushing Hong Kong's comeback attempt. In the end, the Chinese team won their first victory at the Asian Games with a score of 81-62. Liu Zheng finished the game with the highest 18 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists, and 3 steals, while Lin Tingqian had 14 points, 7 assists, and 3 steals. Atino contributed 13 points and 10 rebounds, while Zeng Xiangjun and Abasi each scored 10 points.</p> <p>For Hong Kong, Huilong'er scored the highest 16 points and 8 rebounds, while Xu Yuanzheng had 14 points and Yip Yiu-bun had 10 points.</p>"},{"location":"20231201091229749318/","title":"In the NBA game today, the Thunder defeated the Warriors 130-123 in overtime","text":"<p>In the NBA game today, the Thunder defeated the Warriors 130-123 in overtime.

Protests East Asia Basketball Association's Decision</p> <p>The U16 Asia Youth Men's Basketball Tournament, which was scheduled to take place in Qatar from September 17 to 24, has recently been met with the news that our country's representative team may not be able to participate. Chinese Basketball Association secretary general Li Yunxiang explained today that there are a total of three spots available for the East Asia region this year. However, without discussing with other member countries, the East Asia Basketball Association has decided to use rankings instead of qualifying games to determine participation, resulting in our country being unable to participate as the fourth-ranked team in East Asia. The association has already sent a letter of protest. In the past, there were 16 spots available in the U16 Asia Youth Tournament, with the host and defending champion automatically qualifying, and 2 spots each for the West Asia, East Asia, and Persian Gulf regions, and 1 spot each for the remaining 3 regions and Oceania. The remaining 4 spots are determined based on the performance of each region in the previous tournament. This year, the East Asia region was awarded \"2+1\" spots. Li Yunxiang, secretary general of the Chinese Basketball Association, stated that the association had not received any information about the tournament this year, and after inquiring with other participating countries and sending a letter to the Asian Basketball Federation, they were informed that the qualifications for each region were determined by the respective regional basketball associations. Without a meeting between chairman Yao Ming and other member countries, the East Asia region decided to use rankings instead of qualifying games to determine qualifications, and our country was ranked behind China, Japan, and South Korea, resulting in being unable to participate. Li Yunxiang emphasized that this decision made by the East Asia Basketball Association was not known to member countries such as Hong Kong and Macau, and South Korea and Japan only found out during a U16 video conference that our country was not on the list of participating teams. This prompted the association to send a letter of protest and request for meeting records. Macau Basketball Association secretary general Hu Shufen, who also serves as secretary general of the East Asia Basketball Association, personally apologized, but it was too late to change the fact that our country would not be able to participate this year. The coaching staff and some members of our U16 representative team had already gone to Ulaanbaatar to participate in the East Asian Youth Games and won a silver medal. In order to avoid affecting the players' mood, the basketball association waited until after the tournament to inform them of the possibility that they may not be able to participate this year and proposed the idea of finding other tournaments for the U16 team to continue training. However, with the HBL qualification games approaching, many schools hope that the players can return early.</p>"},{"location":"20231201091322007007/","title":"2023 TGF World Fire Cup Basketball Tournament Player Interview: Shengsheng Fire U Chen Hao and Wang Zhonghan","text":"<p>Chen Hao and Wang Zhonghan, the key players who led Jianguo High School to win two consecutive championships in the past two years, have been teammates for nearly ten years since they were in Sanxing Elementary School and Yongji Junior High School    2023 TGF World Fire Cup Basketball Tournament Player Interview: Shengsheng Fire U Chen Hao and Wang Zhonghan</p> <p>Chen Hao and Wang Zhonghan, the key players who led Jianguo High School to win two consecutive championships in the past two years, have been teammates for nearly ten years since they were in Sanxing Elementary School and Yongji Junior High School. Their relationship and understanding are like blood thicker than water. Now, as they are about to go their separate ways in college, it is inevitable that there will be some reluctance. However, in the last summer vacation of high school, they joined Shengsheng Fire and eventually won the championship in the Central District and the final. They not only won the league but also secured the gold medal for Shengsheng Fire for two consecutive years, marking a perfect end to their high school career.</p> <p>Please continue reading- This year, they won the league championship for two consecutive years. Chen Hao said: \"Last year, I mainly played off the ball, but this year as a senior, I have to take on more responsibility. Actually, I didn't even think about winning the championship at first, so there was no pressure on us. It's possible that because we had no fear, we performed better. As for setbacks, it's just dealing with the busy schedule of college entrance exams, and there's very little time for actual practice. My physical fitness is my weakness, so I need to adjust during the game.\"</p> <p>Please continue reading- Joining Shengsheng Fire, they said: \"Being part of this big family, we feel very free. Plus, our teammates are all talented players from different schools, so it's refreshing to blend in with them. It's more like an exchange than a competition.\"</p> <ul> <li>Faced with the choice of university, Wang Zhonghan said: \"I've always planned to study abroad, and I chose a university in Germany because most of them don't have tuition fees, so the cost won't be much higher than in Taiwan. The Technical University of Munich is also considered the best university in Germany, so I decided to study in the Management &amp; Technology department.\"</li> </ul> <p>Please continue reading- As for Chen Hao, he chose to study at Tsinghua University without specifying a major. He said: \"By chance, I discovered this department at Tsinghua University, which not only satisfies my desire to explore various fields in my freshman year, but also allows me to choose a major that interests me in the future. It's perfect for someone like me who is still uncertain about what to choose.\"</p> <ul> <li>After the end of the TGF World Fire Cup, the two will begin a new journey, and they also hope that their junior teammates will play freely, give their all, and have no regrets as their ultimate goal. In the end, they also send warm and slightly joking wishes to each other. It's not goodbye, it's see you next time. They wish both players to continue to shine in their respective fields and have the chance to reunite at the TGF World Fire Cup next year.</li>

kick off on July 20th, the Western Springs Association Football Club, a women's team in New Zealand, has reached an agreement with its management to equalize their salaries and resources with their male counterparts.</p> <p>Pip Meo, a former member of the New Zealand women's national team, who played a key role in the agreement, pointed out that the fight for equal pay is not just about salaries, but also about the value of women's sports and the positive message it sends to generations of young girls who wear soccer cleats.</p> <p>\"We can't celebrate yet because we have to see how this deal plays out, and we only got what we should have gotten,\" said Meo.</p> <p>According to The Washington Post, while New Zealand's global image has been steadily improving, its soccer industry has long suffered from unequal pay and resource distribution between men and women. Most soccer clubs in New Zealand are amateur clubs run by volunteers and players can only earn a maximum of $94 per week, as determined by the national soccer federation.</p> <p>However, the issue of equal pay has not received much attention from the government. In the New Zealand soccer industry, women receive much lower salaries, have less access to playing fields, equipment, training opportunities, and coaching staff compared to men. It's common for women's teams to have only one coach, while men's teams have several.</p> <p>Last year, members of the Manukau United Football Club in New Zealand launched a campaign for equal pay and resources for men and women, but it ended in failure. Maia Jackman, a team member, said, \"Many female players will speak out for themselves, but they will be discouraged and eventually give up. But the people at Western Springs are different. They have been firm in their beliefs and have not backed down.\"</p> <p>In 2023, Meo and Jackman joined the Western Springs Association, a board of directors mostly made up of men, in an attempt to achieve gender equality in the soccer world.</p> <p>After two months of negotiations, a 12-hour marathon mediation session, and the threat of a strike, Meo and Jackman, along with two pro bono lawyers, reached an agreement with the club's management to achieve gender equality. The club also issued a statement apologizing for its past mistakes.</p> <p>In response to the successful negotiations, Meo said they cannot be too happy yet as the new agreement has not officially been implemented. Jackman added, \"At the end of the day, we just want to play soccer without any restrictions or concerns.\"</p> <p>Jackman said her focus now is on the World Cup, hoping to showcase the beauty of women's soccer to the world through this event.</p> <p>According to CBS and Lexology, unequal pay between genders is still a prevalent issue in many sports around the world.</p> <p>In basketball, for example, the average annual income for male players in the NBA is $5.3 million, with top players earning much more, such as Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant with annual salaries of $45.7 million and $42 million respectively. In comparison, the average annual income for female players in the WNBA is only $130,000, with the highest earning player in the league making only $230,000. However, the reports also pointed out that the main reason for the significant wage gap between men and women in sports is the difference in popularity and revenue generated. The NBA generated $10 billion in revenue last season, while the WNBA only made $60 million. However, in the case of American football, the US women's national team has generated more revenue and viewership than the men's team since 2019, yet their income and winnings were still lower than their male counterparts until last year. According to Lexology, the most effective way to promote gender equality in sports is to increase the promotion of women's sports. This includes encouraging advertising media to promote female athletes and encouraging businesses to invest in and sponsor women's sports and athletes. This will bring more attention to female athletes, generate more revenue, and help promote equal pay between genders. </p>"},{"location":"20231202091139506524/","title":"202324 Key Player: Keegan Murray, Sacramento Kings","text":"<p>Recapping the 2022-23 rookie season, Keegan Murray broke Donovan Mitchell's record for most threes in a rookie season (187) with 206 threes made   202324 Key Player: Keegan Murray, Sacramento Kings</p> <p>Recapping the 2022-23 rookie season, Keegan Murray broke Donovan Mitchell's record for most threes in a rookie season (187) with 206 threes made. What's even more impressive is that this record was achieved with an impressive 41.1% three-point shooting percentage, proving that Keegan is not just a volume shooter, but also an efficient one. This was made possible by the Kings' emphasis on pace and space tactics, as well as the presence of All-Star Domantas Sabonis and the career-best season of De'Aaron Fox, who helped create open shots for Keegan.</p> <p>According to BBall-Index, out of the 22 players who played over 1,000 minutes and ranked in the top 10% for three-point percentage and threes made, only Joe Harris, Jevon Carter, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Malcolm Brogdon had a higher 3PT shot quality than Keegan. This shows that his high three-point shooting percentage was not just due to his own shooting ability, but also the good shot quality he was given by the team. With the Kings making their first playoff appearance in 16 years, even though they had home court advantage, they faced the defending champions, the Golden State Warriors. In a high-pressure and intense series, Keegan struggled in the first three games with only 3.3 points and 4 rebounds per game. However, he surprised everyone in the following games and helped the Kings push the series to a game 7.</p> <p>During the regular season, Keegan averaged only 4.6 rebounds per game, but in the next four games, he showed his ability to rebound by averaging 8 rebounds and scoring double digits in every game. Although the Kings eventually lost the series, Keegan's impact in the later games gave fans and the organization high hopes for his future performances. Visible transformation</p> <p>Every summer is a turning point for NBA players' transformation. Last summer, even during his honeymoon, Fox continued to train hard, which led to his breakout season in 2022-23.</p> <p>As his rookie season ended, Keegan did not take a break and instead trained with Fox during the offseason, with Fox even taking on the role of a mentor. This raises expectations for Keegan's development in the upcoming season, as he has the opportunity to learn from his All-Star teammate. In an interview, Keegan mentioned that they often play one-on-one during their training sessions, and although he has never won against Fox, fans saw a glimpse of what they wanted to see at the California Classic.</p> <p>Even though Keegan had a high efficiency in catch-and-shoot threes, 97.6% of his three-pointers were assisted, which raised doubts about his ability to create his own shots at the NBA level. However, in the California Classic, Keegan proved that he can also create his own shots. In the first game against the Warriors, he scored a game-high 29 points and showed his ability to dribble and finish with a powerful dunk. In the second game against the Miami Heat, he scored 29 points and led the Kings to victory. In the third game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, he hit the game-winning three-pointer despite facing intense defense. And in the final game against the Portland Trail Blazers, he hit the game-winning three-pointer again, helping the Kings complete a perfect record in the California Classic.</p> <p>In summary, Keegan showed more of his ability to create his own shots and make crucial plays in these four games, which he lacked in his rookie season. This raises expectations for his performance in the upcoming season.</p> <p>As a key player for the Sacramento Kings, Keegan will have more opportunities to prove himself in the new season. He will continue to work hard and become a scoring machine for the team, leading them to greater achievements. In him, we see the growth and potential of a young player, and we look forward to seeing him continue to showcase his skills and become one of the pillars of the Kings.</p>"},{"location":"20231202091154509957/","title":"PLG Flying Monkey officially announced the addition of flight instructor, Anthony Tucker","text":"<p>PLG Flying Monkey officially announced the addition of flight instructor, Anthony Tucker.</p> <p>Photo/Taoyuan Pauian Flying Monkeys</p> <p>Taoyuan Pauian Flying Monkeys announced today (10/20) the arrival of flight instructor, Anthony Tucker, who will lead the pilots to soar high.

Recently, he returned to his home country for an interview, talking about the situation at the time and his current recovery.</p> <p>First, he mentioned the process of dealing with the injury at the time, saying, \"Although everything seemed to be going well at first, there were serious complications and I had to have one kidney removed. It felt strange at first, but my condition is getting better and I can start walking and eating. I hope to recover quickly.\"</p> <p>In fact, Simanic's injury was not minor. He had to undergo two surgeries to have his kidney removed, and the complications persisted because his remaining kidney was not functioning properly, according to the doctors. Recalling the situation at the time, Simanic said, \"After the two surgeries, there were five days where I had no idea what was happening in the outside world, I didn't even have my phone. When I finally got my phone back after the first surgery, I sent a message to the team to boost their morale, and their victory meant a lot to me. In this regard, we support each other. During the rest of the games, I could only follow them through my phone.\"</p> <p>The report also revealed his current condition, with Simanic stating that he has to rest for three months without doing anything, and he won't know his future until at least December. \"This time is for my kidney to rest and heal. After this period, I'll have further tests and we'll know if I can continue playing,\" he said.</p> <p>Finally, Simanic expressed his gratitude to the fans and his team, saying, \"I want to thank everyone who has cared about me, especially my team. I wouldn't have been this strong without their support. I also want to thank all the fans who support the Serbian national team. Your support means a lot to me. I will do everything I can to recover and hope to return to the court as soon as possible.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231202091220820667/","title":"\u7e3d\u6559\u7df4 Rick Carlisle

During the interview, Cuban also revealed that he had traded away a player due to their excessive drug use.</p> <p>Beverley asked, \"If a player is averaging 17 points per game, but has some bad habits. Maybe he's into partying or gambling, everyone has their vices. As a team owner, does this information affect how much you offer him in a contract?\" Cuban replied, \"Absolutely, 100%, because this is a team. I'm not lying, I have traded players because they were doing too much.\"</p> <p>\"Each team has its own culture. If you have young players who are still learning the game and they occasionally smoke, but don't understand the team or NBA culture, and then you have a guy who lives on your floor in the hotel and suddenly other young players start picking up these bad habits, you see them walking out of their rooms with red eyes, and you don't want them going down that path,\" Cuban explained. \"Smoking is one thing, but the strength and frequency of what you're smoking is another. If you go beyond a certain level, then you have to consider the bigger picture, and that doesn't fit our team culture,\" he added.</p> <p>In the lives of NBA players, bad habits and temptations are everywhere, but as a team owner, Cuban places great importance on players' discipline. He not only wants them to perform well on the court, but also to maintain good habits off the court. Therefore, when a player's bad habits start affecting the overall atmosphere and culture of the team, Cuban will not hesitate to trade them away. </p>"},{"location":"20231202091234532854/","title":"2023 TGF Fire Fighting Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview - Wu Bo Lin, Rain","text":"<p>This year, the senior team from the northern district, represented by Wu Bo Lin, Rain, made it to the FINAL 4 of the national tournament    2023 TGF Fire Fighting Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview - Wu Bo Lin, Rain</p> <p>This year, the senior team from the northern district, represented by Wu Bo Lin, Rain, made it to the FINAL 4 of the national tournament. Among them, Tsai Jing Zhou, who won both the assists king and steals king in the finals, is also a representative of TGF alumni. This time, they gathered players from different universities such as Shih Hsin, Yun Tech, Taitung, and National Sports University, and even NCAA players. After winning the runner-up in the northern district, they made it to the finals of the national tournament. For them, basketball is like a remote control. TGF represents their home, and they all share this remote control to turn the TV to the most interesting and suitable program for them. Just like how they find the most comfortable rhythm as a team in TGF. Please continue reading.</p> <p>This year, the team participated in TGF as senior players, which is different from the past. Tsai Jing Zhou said with satisfaction, \"There is a feeling of cherishing everything. It is not easy to set up a stage, because we are playing on a stage that others have built. If it were us, the feeling would be completely different. So I cherish it even more, and can only express it with cherishing!\" Please continue reading. </p> <p>TGF has given them a feeling of bringing together players from different regions to compete, which is very exciting. Each region also has its own style, not just in terms of basketball skills, but also in the interactions on and off the court. As the name suggests, TGF is about passing on and sharing this stage, enjoying it and cherishing it! Compared to single-school and cross-school teams, it is more challenging for the senior team to gather together, but everyone is willing to come together from all over the world during summer vacation to play basketball, which is something worth remembering. Whether in the future as teammates, opponents, or colleagues, it is a deeper connection. The basketball game may end, but the bond between each other will not. Looking forward to the next time we meet, may we all take a step closer towards our dreams.

<p>Please continue reading as the first quarter of the game showed a decent level of focus on both offense and defense, which was a good improvement compared to the team's previous disastrous performances. However, in the second quarter, the Warriors' quick passing and cutting constantly broke through the 3-2 zone defense.</p> <p>The team tried putting Daniel on the arrow position, but he was unable to fully execute his pre-game strategy due to the frequent fouls he received. It was a shame. It was clear that the team focused more on perimeter defense in this game, but they still allowed six 3-pointers in the first half. The shifting of the defense also left the interior vulnerable, resulting in fouls or a situation where there were fewer defenders than the opponents when the ball was passed to the edge of the restricted area. Improving the team's zone defense will be an important lesson to learn from this game. </p> <p>Man-to-man defense was not bad at the beginning of the second quarter, but the Warriors' high level of experience, as well as Sintlei and Shimen's vision, constantly exposed the team's backdoor defense. The players' focus and communication on defense still need to be improved. On the offensive end, the Ironmen heavily relied on 3-pointers, but only made 9 out of 32 attempts (28.1%). The team also lacked a skilled big man like Iron Rice who could set screens and create chaos, resulting in a more predictable offense. The Warriors' aggressive defense not only drained the players' energy while running, but also nullified many of the team's tactics, such as the Iverson cut and the double drag without the ball. The team needs to be better prepared for the next game against the defending champions. Go Ironmen! Please continue reading as Qu stated in the press conference that the Bank of Taiwan, as a three-time defending champion, has its own strengths. They play aggressively and smartly, which are things the Ironmen players need to continuously learn. As for my question about Beek's integration into the team, the coach mentioned that he still needs to improve in some areas, but hopes to progress quickly because in such a high-pressure environment, the opponents won't wait for him to catch up (so I think if Beek's performance continues to disappoint, he needs to be more cautious). Next game: 11/18 14:30 away game against the Formosa Dreamers. Outstanding players: Please continue reading as Wukong scored 21 points, 1 rebound, and 6 assists; Lin scored 13 points and grabbed 5 rebounds; Bennett scored 23 points, 12 rebounds, 1 steal, and 1 block; Liu Chengyan and Lu Zheyi made good use of their short playing time, each scoring a 3-pointer.</p>"},{"location":"20231203091205464544/","title":"PLG Dreamers to Host Dream Link Exchange Tournament with Five Teams Competing at Mini Egg Fantasy Battle","text":"<p>Image/ PLG Dreamers</p> <p>Today (18th), the PLG Dreamers team from Formosa announced that they will gather teams from two leagues to hold the \"Dream Link\" exchange tournament    PLG Dreamers to Host Dream Link Exchange Tournament with Five Teams Competing at Mini Egg Fantasy Battle</p> <p>Image/ PLG Dreamers</p> <p>Today (18th), the PLG Dreamers team from Formosa announced that they will gather teams from two leagues to hold the \"Dream Link\" exchange tournament.

Photo/ Provided by T1 League</p> <p>The Taiwan Beer Yulon Leopards, now known as T1 League, made their debut in a preseason game today, losing by 4 points to the Kaohsiung Family Mart Seahawks. Among the team's two major local talents, Chiang Yu-An and Lin Hsin-Kuan, who just won the 3x3 gold medal at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, it was evident that they were still trying to find their synergy with the team. Chiang Yu-An also revealed that after joining T1 and Yulon, and moving to a new environment, he is naturally a bit shy and needs some time to adapt.</p> <p>T1 and Yulon announced their collaboration during the offseason this year, with players such as Chiang Yu-An, Li Chi-Wei, and Huang Chen joining the T1 Yulon Leopards. However, Chiang Yu-An went to play in the Chinese NBL during the offseason, only returning on the 12th to join the team's training. With limited training time, he was still trying to find his chemistry with his new teammates and foreign players, ultimately contributing 9 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists. When asked about his performance in the first preseason game, Chiang Yu-An said, \"I just joined the team, so I still need to get familiar with my teammates' characteristics, especially the foreign players. Plus, my condition is not that great, so I need to adjust slowly.</p> <p>\"I'm still a rookie now, having only trained twice. There are a lot of new tactics, playing style, coaches, and teammates that I need to integrate into quickly.\"</p> <p>Regarding the decision to merge T1 and Yulon, Chiang Yu-An honestly said that he spent the first 9 seasons of his career in the Taiwan Beer system, and when he first heard the news, he did feel a bit sudden and was not mentally prepared. \"But I also told myself that this is basketball, and I have to adapt to the new environment as soon as possible. However, I am a bit shy, so it will take some time for me to get used to it.\" As for Lin Hsin-Kuan, who just won the 3x3 basketball gold medal for our country at the Asian Games in Hangzhou, he also joined the team's training recently and scored 3 points and 4 rebounds today. With both key local players joining the training for a short time, national team player Li Chi-Wei will not join until next Wednesday. T1 Yulon Leopards head coach Michael Olson said, \"Everyone wants to know how our two teams will integrate, but we won't have the first training with the full team until next Wednesday when Chi-Wei returns. So I can't answer that question right now.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231204091151082307/","title":"2023 TGF Fire Safety Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview - Zhiping High School","text":"<p>Zhiping High School has been participating in the TGF Fire Safety Cup since 2021, when they ended their journey in the Northern Division preliminary round    2023 TGF Fire Safety Cup Basketball Tournament Team Interview - Zhiping High School</p> <p>Zhiping High School has been participating in the TGF Fire Safety Cup since 2021, when they ended their journey in the Northern Division preliminary round. After the cancellation of the tournament in 2022 due to the pandemic, they once again challenged and won the Northern Division and National Finals in the Single School Group this year. Facing tough opponents from all over the country, Zhiping High School overcame all obstacles and even encountered a bottleneck during the final match, but successfully adjusted and found their rhythm on the third day. They met Kaohsiung Industrial Vocational High School in the championship match, completing a sweet revenge and bringing the National Single School Group championship back to the Northern Division for the first time since 2018! Please continue reading below.</p> <p>Zhiping High School already had a top-level team, but due to the system, they were unable to form a team of regular students to participate in the secondary league. However, these basketball enthusiasts continue to work hard for their passion. The team was established about 5 years ago and this year's players consisted of seven first-year students and five second-year students. Many of them were participating in the TGF Fire Safety Cup for the first time, but this also allowed them to experience a completely different style of basketball and atmosphere.</p> <p>When asked about the most memorable matches in the Northern Division preliminary round and National Finals, 16-year-old Y\u00fa M\u00e8ngx\u00fan said, \"In the preliminary round, we had a chance to secure a spot in the top four, but due to our own mistakes, we ended up losing. However, we were given a second chance in the finals against Kaohsiung Industrial Vocational High School. We learned from our previous mistakes and improved our three-point shooting. The most crucial change was the coach's adjustment in defense. With these changes, we were able to secure the victory and successfully avenge our previous loss.\"</p> <p>However, Zhiping High School faced some challenges when they first arrived at the tournament venue. The players admitted that they were too relaxed in the first two games of the National Finals, which led to a difficult win in the first game and a loss in the second game due to too many mistakes. From the third game onwards, they gradually improved and became more aggressive on defense. During the semifinals, they played according to their expectations and even discussed the problems and adjustments needed after each game. With everyone pointing out each other's mistakes and making timely adjustments, as well as their growing team cohesion, they were able to bring home the championship.</p> <p>In addition, Ch\u00e9n L\u00ecy\u01d4, who won the FMVP award in the championship game, impressed everyone with his outstanding performance, helping the team with his offensive firepower. Y\u00fa M\u00e8ngx\u00fan, who won the FMVP award in the preliminary round, also won the Assist King award in the finals, while Zh\u0101ng \u0112nq\u00ed won the Steal King award, making them the biggest winners in the Single School Group. The chemistry between these three players was crucial in Zhiping High School's championship victory.</p> <p>The coach who led the team to victory, Hu\u00e1ng D\u00e9f\u0113ng, also received the Best Coach award from the tournament. When asked about his thoughts and feelings this year, he said, \"I am grateful to the TGF Fire Safety Cup for providing such a great stage for these young players to showcase and prove themselves. We didn't expect to win the championship this year, especially since our physical condition and experience were not as good as last year. However, the trust, unity, and never-give-up attitude among the players were the most touching and proud moments for me and Coach W\u00fa Zh\u00e8ngxian. I hope they can pass on this energy to the younger players and continue to improve.\" Lastly, Zhiping High School would like to thank the TGF Fire Safety Cup for providing this platform for their players to shine, and they also want to give a special thanks to the school's chairman and the team's manager for taking good care of the athletes and allowing them to focus on their training without any worries, and they hope to defend their championship title next year.</p>"},{"location":"20231204091202103024/","title":"The NBA PG talks about Westbrook's willingness to come off the bench and expresses his admiration for him cannot be put into words","text":"<p>The NBA PG talks about Westbrook's willingness to come off the bench and expresses his admiration for him cannot be put into words.</p> <p>Paul George.

This article will end with two important points, so please remember to read until the end.</p> <p>TSG 93:94 Fubon Braves, Fubon Braves Take Advantage of Timing and Home Court Advantage</p> <p>In this game, the referees played a crucial role in helping the Fubon Braves secure a victory. Let's take a look at the conditions that were listed in last week's recap for the Braves to defeat Fubon: first, to find a way to limit Abasi's performance (which was not achieved as Abasi still scored 28 points with a high shooting percentage). Second, the number four local player must be strong (in this game, Lu Wei-ting's performance was lackluster). Third, the import player must outplay the opposing import player (Jones only scored 2 points in 20 minutes, while Fubon's import player, Kuzas, scored 29 points with a high shooting percentage of 78.6%). Fourth, the point guard must match up with Lin Wei-han or at least not lose too badly (this was achieved as Fubon's point guard, Brickman, outperformed the opposing point guard). Fifth, the import player must outperform the opposing import player (Kuzas outscored Fubon's import player, Chris, with 14 points to 8 points and a shooting percentage of 60%). Sixth, take advantage of Fubon's mistakes (which was achieved as Fubon struggled in the second half). Lastly, the referees' calls must be in favor of the Braves (which was also achieved). Despite all these conditions being met, the Braves only won by one point and had to rely on a last-second shot. In my opinion, this win was completely handed to them, and there are still areas for improvement. </p> <p>However, it seems that Coach Lai is starting to use Tang Wei-jie more in the rotation. Will there be any changes coming up? Please continue reading for more.</p> <p>TB 111:104 Yulon Luxgen Dinos, Huang Tsung-han Scores Seven Three-Pointers, and Kao Chin-wei Dominates the Fourth Quarter</p> <p>In this game, the Yulon Luxgen Dinos were without their rebounding powerhouse, Williams, and had to rely on their two imports to carry the team throughout the game. Although they were behind for most of the game, they made a comeback in the fourth quarter and gave the Taiwan Beer team a scare. Kao Chin-wei played his best game so far, scoring 23 points in 31 minutes and leading the team in the fourth quarter. Even though they couldn't complete the comeback, his performance was still commendable. On the Taiwan Beer side, Huang Tsung-han also scored 23 points, including seven three-pointers, helping the team secure their second consecutive win. As mentioned in the analysis of Taiwan Beer last week, they rely heavily on their local players to win games. In this game, their local players scored a total of 45 points, matching Yulon's 49 points from their local players. It will be interesting to see if Taiwan Beer's local players can maintain this level of performance in the upcoming games.</p> <p>TB 98:89 Fubon Braves, Old Rivals Clash in a Close Game, King and His One-Man Show</p> <p>In last season's game between the Taiwan Beer and Fubon Braves, the two teams had developed a deep rivalry due to various reasons. In this game, both teams fought fiercely, with the score constantly changing hands. In the end, Taiwan Beer managed to secure the win with King's unstoppable one-on-one performance. I must give a big praise to Coach Liu Meng-zhu for using the imports so effectively. If you haven't noticed, please pay attention to the substitutions made by Coach Liu. In the first half, he used a simple but effective strategy - matching the imports against each other. This means that De Guzman guarded Kuzas, Buford guarded Allen, and King guarded Brickman. This resulted in the Fubon Braves constantly rotating their guards, while the Taiwan Beer forwards were all able to focus on guarding King. As a result, King scored 33 points, while the Braves' local players only managed to score a total of 22 points. On the other hand, De Guzman and Lee Han-sung combined for 29 points, successfully containing Brickman.</p> <p>Speaking of the Braves' three-point shooting percentage, it seems to be particularly low in games against the Yulon Dinos and Taiwan Beer, with an average of 23.5% against the Dinos and 9.1% against Taiwan Beer. This is due to the amount of energy the forwards have to expend on defense. Against the Dinos, the forwards have to guard Abasi and Flying Wolf, while against Taiwan Beer, they have to guard King. When you're already exhausted from defending, how can you expect to make three-point shots? This is something the coaching staff of the Braves should consider.</p> <p>But let's not forget, the analysis of the Braves' depth has been mentioned before, so please refer to it if you haven't read it yet. In this game, both teams attempted 25 three-pointers, but the Braves only made 9 of them, while Taiwan Beer made 11. This is the key difference in the shooting percentage. The Braves need to make some serious changes, while Taiwan Beer is still playing at the same level as before.</p> <p>In the fourth quarter of this game, King's one-man show overwhelmed the Braves, while the guards of Taiwan Beer were able to easily pick apart the Braves' defense. Are the Braves' guards focused on defending or attacking?

T1 League president Qian Weijuan expressed her frustration in her dual roles. As a senior in the basketball community, she is very angry about the situation. As the president of T1 League, she has to not only handle service, game affairs, and business matters, but also take on a supervisory role. She is currently in close contact with the teams, hoping to put an end to such situations. SBL player Wu Jiyin, who was involved in match-fixing and gambling, was summoned by the district prosecutor and released on bail. The Chinese Basketball Association also held a disciplinary committee meeting yesterday, announcing the revocation of Wu Jiyin's player registration. In the future, CBA teams are not allowed to employ him, and the decision will also be communicated to the Chinese Professional Basketball League for follow-up action.</p> <p>Regarding Wu Jiyin, who had previously played for T1 team, Qian Weijuan said that she has two different perspectives. First, as a senior in the basketball community, she is very angry because it takes a lot of effort from many people to bring the basketball scene to where it is today.</p> <p>As for her role as T1 League president, Qian Weijuan emphasized the role of the league. Apart from providing services, handling game affairs and business matters, she also has to stand in a supervisory position to prevent such incidents from happening in the future. \"We have measures in place, such as taking classes with legal personnel and consultants. Based on our past experience in baseball, this is the biggest harm. Our loyal fans are standing by us, and we cannot break their hearts. The league's regulations have also been established, and there is no room for such incidents. We are also in constant communication with the teams, closely monitoring any large sum of money involved. At the moment, these are just rumors.\" Qian Weijuan concluded with a heartfelt message, saying that in her conversations with the players these past two days, she reminded them to cherish themselves, as it is currently the best era for Taiwanese basketball. Especially with more choices for college players, \"We don't know what the future holds, but we have to start by doing our own best, and the environment will naturally improve.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231204091246902918/","title":"BLG Tainan TSG Baller Liu Chun-ting to Join Japanese B2 Team Aomori Watari","text":"<p>Liu Chun-ting    BLG Tainan TSG Baller Liu Chun-ting to Join Japanese B2 Team Aomori Watari</p> <p>Liu Chun-ting.</p> <p>Photo/Aomori Watari According to an official announcement from the Japanese B2 team Aomori Watari, Taiwanese player Liu Chun-ting will be playing for the team in the upcoming season.

This article will not focus on the team's performance, but rather take a look back at the team-building philosophy that Stevens has demonstrated from being a coach to a general manager. Please continue reading below.</p> <ol> <li>No such thing as a traditional \"ball-handling\" role Since Stevens took over as head coach, except for Rajon Rondo, the team has had no traditional ball-handlers.</li> </ol> <p>From Isaiah Thomas, Kyrie Irving, Terry Rozier to Kemba Walker, they are all offensive-minded guards. Of course, this may be a result of the changing environment and the evolution of player abilities. However, Stevens' Motion Offense philosophy puts more emphasis on quality screening and players' ability to read and react, so we can see different players initiating tactics in the half-court offense. Please continue reading below.</p> <p>Moreover, this influence also appears in transition attacks. In games under Stevens' coaching, we can see big men or wings quickly passing or pushing the ball after grabbing rebounds. If there is no chance for a fast break, they will quickly pass the ball to the primary ball-handler and set screens to create a second opportunity for early offense.</p> <p>One of the early offensive tactics Stevens likes to use.</p> <ol> <li>Shooting is secondary, high-quality screening and playmaking big men are key</li> </ol> <p>Celtics fans may mistakenly think that under Stevens' recent management, he loves stretch-shooting big men. Of course, Kelly Olynyk also became a stretch-four in his system, but in reality, even in the small-ball era, Stevens still puts on the court big men with no outside shooting ability, such as Amir Johnson, Aron Baynes, Tristan Thompson, and Enes Kanter (Freedom). Apart from height and rebounding, he values their screening abilities.</p> <p>Among them, Al Horford and Daniel Theis are undoubtedly Stevens' favorites.</p> <p>Please continue reading below.</p> <p>These two players not only provide high-quality screening, but also have good passing abilities from the high post. They can also execute pick-and-pop plays or be ready on the perimeter to open up space for the offense. After Stevens became the GM, he brought these two big men back to Boston, showing his love for them.</p> <ol> <li>\"Swiss Army knife\" wings are never too many</li> </ol> <p>In Stevens' system, the role of a swingman is clear and simple. As long as they can defend or shoot threes, they can definitely earn playing time and serve as a reliable role player.</p> <p>From Jae Crowder, Jonas Jerebko to Semi Ojeleye, Grant Williams, Romeo Langford.</p> <p>Although some of these players' potentials were not fully developed, they still shone in Stevens' system compared to the undersized guards drafted by Ainge. After reading the three points above, we should have some understanding of Stevens' management and team-building philosophy.</p> <p>Next, let's take a look back at some key moves he made in the past two seasons.

It also demonstrates the powerful team culture that the Clippers have built off the court, as the players will go to extreme measures to achieve a challenge.</p>"},{"location":"20231205091157277209/","title":"NBA Resting Policy Officially Implemented, 48 Players Affected","text":"<p>The NBA Resting Policy, proposed earlier this week and officially passed by the NBA Board of Governors in the past few days, will go into effect in the 2023-24 season, affecting a total of 48 players    NBA Resting Policy Officially Implemented, 48 Players Affected</p> <p>The NBA Resting Policy, proposed earlier this week and officially passed by the NBA Board of Governors in the past few days, will go into effect in the 2023-24 season, affecting a total of 48 players. This policy prohibits players from missing regular-season games without a valid reason.</p> <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. Photo/Reuters</p> <p>As previously reported, the NBA Resting Policy has five main directions: besides the previously mentioned restriction on multiple star players resting at the same time on the same team, the NBA also requires players to have no significant injuries and not to miss important games (such as mid-season tournaments and nationally televised games) in order to be eligible for personal awards that require playing in at least 65 games.</p> <p>According to a list compiled by ESPN reporter Bobby Marks, the players affected by this policy are defined as those who have been selected for the All-Star Game and All-NBA teams in the past three years.</p> <p>It is expected that 48 players will be affected by this policy, including some big names such as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Steph Curry. According to Marks' news, if a player is selected as an All-Star during the season, whether it is his first time or after a three-year gap, he will also be included in this list. Marks used Tyrese Maxey of the Philadelphia 76ers as an example. If he is selected for the All-Star Game for the first time next February, he will be included in this list after the All-Star Game and will be subject to the resting policy for the rest of the season.</p> <p>In addition, Marks mentioned that popular rookie Victor Wembanyama will not be affected by this resting policy as he has no record of playing in the NBA. He will only be included in this list if he is selected as an All-Star during his rookie season. Marks also pointed out that the restrictions on playing at least 65 games do not apply to Rookie of the Year and All-Rookie teams.</p>"},{"location":"20231205091205043381/","title":"\u518d\u8005\uff0c\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u7684\u5230\u4f86\u5c0d\u570b\u738b\u7684\u5e74\u8f15\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c07\u7522\u751f\u7a4d\u6975\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002","text":"<p>\u9664\u4e86\u5f1f\u5f1f\u6797\u66f8\u7def\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u570b\u738b\u9084\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u5e74\u8f15\u6709\u6f5b\u529b\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4e0a\u5b63\u70ba\u570b\u738b\u51fa\u8cfd\u7684\u5e74\u50c523\u6b72\u7684\u5f35\u5b9c\u862d\u300124\u6b72\u7684\u8a31\u667a\u7a0b\u300125\u6b72\u7684\u5289\u65fb\u745e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u79c0\u8449\u555f\u653f\u7b49\uff0c\u90fd\u5c07\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u8ddf\u96a8\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002</p> <p>\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u5728\u7403\u5834\u4e0a\u7684\u9818\u5c0e\u529b\u548c\u5c08\u696d\u614b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c0d\u570b\u738b\u7684\u5e74\u8f15\u7403\u54e1\u4f86\u8aaa\u90fd\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u699c\u6a23\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u52a0\u5165\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c07\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u5e36\u4f86\u66f4\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u3002</p> <p>\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u570b\u738b\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u6c7a\u7684\u6700\u5927\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u8b93\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u548c\u6797\u66f8\u7def\u4e00\u8d77\u4e0a\u5834\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002</p> <p>\u76ee\u524d\u4f86\u770b\uff0c\u570b\u738b\u7684\u5148\u767c\u9663\u5bb9\u61c9\u8a72\u662f\u6d0b\u5c07\u7c73\u6b47\u723e\u3001\u6bd4\u5229\u3001\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u3001\u6797\u66f8\u7def\u548c\u4e2d\u92d2\u7267\u502b\u65af\u3002\u4f46\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u9663\u5bb9\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u56e0\u70ba\u9632\u5b88\u548c\u9ad4\u80fd\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u9577\u905440\u5834\u7684\u4f8b\u884c\u8cfd\u4e2d\uff0c\u51fa\u73fe\u4e00\u4e9b\u75b2\u618a\u548c\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u570b\u738b\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u500b\u5e73\u8861\u9ede\uff0c\u8b93\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u548c\u6797\u66f8\u7def\u90fd\u80fd\u767c\u63ee\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u72c0\u614b\u3002</p> <p>\u7e3d\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u52a0\u76dfPLG\u65b0\u5317\u570b\u738b\uff0c\u5c07\u5e36\u7d66\u7403\u968a\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u5230\u4f86\uff0c\u4e5f\u662fPLG\u722d\u51a0\u6700\u5f8c\u62fc\u5716\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u671f\u5f85\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u5728\u53f0\u7063\u7684\u7cbe\u5f69\u8868\u73fe\u5427\uff01    \u518d\u8005\uff0c\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u7684\u5230\u4f86\u5c0d\u570b\u738b\u7684\u5e74\u8f15\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c07\u7522\u751f\u7a4d\u6975\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002</p> <p>\u9664\u4e86\u5f1f\u5f1f\u6797\u66f8\u7def\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u570b\u738b\u9084\u6709\u8a31\u591a\u5e74\u8f15\u6709\u6f5b\u529b\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4e0a\u5b63\u70ba\u570b\u738b\u51fa\u8cfd\u7684\u5e74\u50c523\u6b72\u7684\u5f35\u5b9c\u862d\u300124\u6b72\u7684\u8a31\u667a\u7a0b\u300125\u6b72\u7684\u5289\u65fb\u745e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u79c0\u8449\u555f\u653f\u7b49\uff0c\u90fd\u5c07\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u8ddf\u96a8\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u5b78\u7fd2\u3002</p> <p>\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u5728\u7403\u5834\u4e0a\u7684\u9818\u5c0e\u529b\u548c\u5c08\u696d\u614b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c0d\u570b\u738b\u7684\u5e74\u8f15\u7403\u54e1\u4f86\u8aaa\u90fd\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u699c\u6a23\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u52a0\u5165\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c07\u70ba\u7403\u968a\u5e36\u4f86\u66f4\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u3002</p> <p>\u6700\u5f8c\uff0c\u570b\u738b\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u6c7a\u7684\u6700\u5927\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u8b93\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u548c\u6797\u66f8\u7def\u4e00\u8d77\u4e0a\u5834\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002</p> <p>\u76ee\u524d\u4f86\u770b\uff0c\u570b\u738b\u7684\u5148\u767c\u9663\u5bb9\u61c9\u8a72\u662f\u6d0b\u5c07\u7c73\u6b47\u723e\u3001\u6bd4\u5229\u3001\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u3001\u6797\u66f8\u7def\u548c\u4e2d\u92d2\u7267\u502b\u65af\u3002\u4f46\u9019\u6a23\u7684\u9663\u5bb9\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u56e0\u70ba\u9632\u5b88\u548c\u9ad4\u80fd\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u9577\u905440\u5834\u7684\u4f8b\u884c\u8cfd\u4e2d\uff0c\u51fa\u73fe\u4e00\u4e9b\u75b2\u618a\u548c\u4e0d\u7a69\u5b9a\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u570b\u738b\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u500b\u5e73\u8861\u9ede\uff0c\u8b93\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u548c\u6797\u66f8\u7def\u90fd\u80fd\u767c\u63ee\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u72c0\u614b\u3002</p> <p>\u7e3d\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u52a0\u76dfPLG\u65b0\u5317\u570b\u738b\uff0c\u5c07\u5e36\u7d66\u7403\u968a\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u5230\u4f86\uff0c\u4e5f\u662fPLG\u722d\u51a0\u6700\u5f8c\u62fc\u5716\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002\u8b93\u6211\u5011\u4e00\u8d77\u671f\u5f85\u6797\u66f8\u8c6a\u5728\u53f0\u7063\u7684\u7cbe\u5f69\u8868\u73fe\u5427\uff01</p>"},{"location":"20231205091211897336/","title":". South KoreaAsian Games Men's Basketball: China vs. South Korea","text":"<p>Hangzhou Asian Games Men's Basketball: China vs </p> <p>Hangzhou Asian Games Men's Basketball: China vs. Hong Kong Post-Game Analysis</p> <p>The Chinese men's basketball team emerged victorious in their first game of the Hangzhou Asian Games, defeating Hong Kong 81-62. Tomorrow, they will face the host team, China. Let's continue reading for a breakdown of this game and a prediction for tomorrow.</p> <p>This was the first game of the Hangzhou Asian Games for the Chinese men's basketball team. Although their opponents were the weaker Hong Kong team, their performance was not as expected. Let's analyze their performance today and look ahead to tomorrow. Based on their previous performances, the Chinese men's basketball team did not live up to their usual standards.</p> <p>However, I personally believe this was a strategic decision by the coaching staff. After all, their opponents were not strong enough to warrant an overly aggressive game that could lead to injuries. The focus should be on the game against China and Mongolia in the coming days.</p> <p>Despite this, the Chinese team's performance today was a bit lackluster. They had some lapses in defense, allowing easy layups for their opponents. On offense, they mainly relied on running plays and passing the ball, rather than individual drives. Overall, their teamwork was the key.</p> <p>However, there was one area of concern for the Chinese team today - their three-point shooting. We cannot be sure if it was due to adjusting to the court or adapting to the conditions, but their three-point accuracy was lacking. If they cannot improve their three-point shooting tomorrow against China, it may be difficult for them to take advantage inside the paint and they could face a tough battle.</p> <p>We can only hope that the Chinese team can find their rhythm tomorrow. It was evident that the coaching staff gave all players some playing time to find their groove and get into game shape. Tomorrow's game will likely see a different strategic approach.</p> <p>It's also possible that the coaching staff is still unsure about the players' condition and is testing their performance on the court. Now, let's talk about individual performances. First, let's discuss Atingo. In the fourth quarter of today's game, Atingo lost his temper and was ejected after receiving a technical foul for unsportsmanlike conduct.</p> <p>This is not good news for the Chinese team, as if Atingo struggles against China's inside players, his emotions could become a factor. Next, let's talk about Zeng Xiangjun, who had an outstanding performance today. He was impressive with his shooting and positioning under the basket. I believe his performance will be crucial tomorrow, as he could provide a lot of pressure for China's inside players.</p> <p>Now, onto Lin Tingqian, who made three out of three three-point shots today. We have to say that he is currently the most reliable scorer for the Chinese team. He rarely makes mistakes and always contributes to the team's performance.</p> <p>His performance tomorrow will be crucial, as he is an important player in the backcourt. Next is Liu Zheng, who scored a game-high 18 points today. In the closing minutes of the game, we could see that his shooting was back on track. With his experience and defensive abilities, he is expected to have another good game tomorrow.</p> <p>I also believe there is a key group of players - the shooters on the Chinese team. Whether it's Lu Junxiang, Li Qiwei, or Xie Yaxuan, their performances were subpar today and will be crucial tomorrow against China. If they cannot create space with their outside shooting, China's defense will collapse, making it difficult for Atingo to score. Therefore, their performance tomorrow will have a significant impact on the game.</p> <p>Finally, let's talk about Abasi, who did not see much playing time today and may have been saving his energy for tomorrow's game against China. However, his three-point shooting was not on point, and he needs to make his shots to draw defenders and create opportunities to drive. We can only hope that he finds his rhythm tomorrow.</p> <p>Lastly, congratulations to the Chinese team for their victory today, despite their less-than-satisfactory performance. Let's once again congratulate them on their win. We wish them all the best tomorrow against China and hope they can exceed everyone's expectations and defeat them once again. (We will also report on the game against China tomorrow, so let's all cheer for the Chinese team together!)</p>"},{"location":"20231205091224754064/","title":"4 pick in 2019, which was later traded back to the Pelicans for three lower picks, one of which was used to acquire Jaxson Hayes) to form one of the strongest duos in NBA history: LeBron James and Anthony Davis","text":"<p>4 pick in 2019, which was later traded back to the Pelicans for three lower picks, one of which was used to acquire Jaxson Hayes) to form one of the strongest duos in NBA history: LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The Lakers immediately saw the payoff, finishing the regular season with a league-best record of 52 wins and 19 losses (due to the shortened season caused by the pandemic) and ultimately winning the championship in the NBA Bubble by defeating the Miami Heat.</p> <p>During most of the season, the Lakers deployed a twin-tower starting lineup, with JaVale McGee starting at center and later replaced by Dwight Howard to pair up with Davis.</p> <p>Now, let's take a look at the Lakers' outlook for the upcoming season as they try to replicate their success from 2019-20. However, it may not be as easy as it seems, especially after their disappointing sweep in the Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets. The Lakers' opponent in the 2019-20 Western Conference Finals was none other than the Nuggets. One of the key factors that helped the Lakers advance with a 4-1 series win was their ability to rotate between McGee and Howard to defend against Nikola Jokic, limiting his impact on the court. However, things may not be the same this time around, and there are three main reasons why.</p> <p>Firstly, as mentioned in my previous article, LeBron's offensive numbers do not show any signs of significant decline (which is admirable), with the only noticeable difference being his reduced ability to drive to the basket on his first step compared to his younger days. Instead, he relies more on his jump shot to score, which was evident in the Western Conference Finals against Aaron Gordon's defense.</p> <p>However, LeBron's decline is more apparent on the defensive end. As shown in the picture below, he often tends to slack off on defense, especially when guarding perimeter shooters. This means that he no longer has the energy to cover the perimeter or move around the court as much, so even though LeBron used to be able to guard point guards and even play as a center (he was selected to the NBA All-Defensive First Team for five consecutive years from 2009-2013), in the latter stages of his career, he can only play one position, and that's power forward.</p> <p>A similar example is LeBron's draft classmate, Carmelo Anthony, who used to play as a small forward but now mostly plays as a power forward in the later stages of his career.</p> <p>Compared to playing as a small forward, playing as a power forward requires less movement and allows for more rest time, such as posting up and grabbing rebounds.</p> <p>With LeBron occupying the power forward position, do the Lakers expect AD to defend against small forwards? </p> <p>Secondly, the Lakers' new additions, Hayes and Wood, are not pure centers like McGee or Howard, but rather centers who can also play as power forwards.</p> <p>At 7'0 tall, Hayes was given a chance to start for the Pelicans towards the end of the 2021-22 season due to Williamson's injury, and he ended up performing unexpectedly well while playing alongside either Jonas Valanciunas or Juancho Hernangomez.</p> <p>Despite Hayes' ability to move quickly for his height and his decent shooting range, his attitude issues have hindered him from reaching his full potential, which is why he is currently only earning a minimum salary.</p> <p>As for Wood, who stands at 6'10, he is more of a stretch 4 who can create space and also provides solid defense. Some may argue that I am nitpicking, and that they can simply play as centers when needed. While that may be true, my point is that Hayes or Wood lack the ability to defend against traditional centers, which means that the Lakers may still have to rely on AD to do so.</p> <p>Lastly, the Lakers' new roster for the upcoming season is completely different from the championship-winning team in 2020. The Lakers' success in the 2020 season was mainly due to their strong defense, with the help of their twin-tower lineup. AD's defense speaks for itself, and LeBron was still playing at a high level defensively. Let's not forget about the Lakers' backcourt players at the time: Avery Bradley, Alex Caruso, Danny Green, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, all of whom are 3-and-D players who excel in defense but lack the ability to create their own shots. This meant that having McGee or Howard on the court did not pose a threat to their defense in the paint.</p> <p>In the same season, the Houston Rockets decided to trade away their center Clint Capela to clear the way for James Harden and Russell Westbrook, and opted to play 6'7 Robert Covington at center.</p> <p>Although the Rockets played small-ball against the Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals and ended up losing 1-4, it is worth noting that the Lakers' twin-tower lineup was successful mainly because of their team's overall strategy. However, with the current Lakers roster, aside from the issues with LeBron that I mentioned earlier, the starting backcourt will most likely be Russell Westbrook and Austin Reaves, even if Hayes and Wood are able to stretch the floor, their impact will still be limited. Imagine Reaves driving to the basket and being met with a big man, will he still be as effective?</p> <p>In conclusion, while I believe that the Lakers will still have a decent record next season, there are still many issues that need to be addressed if they want to win another championship, especially in terms of their frontcourt and center position. LeBron's aging, the characteristics of the new players, and their team's overall strategy are all factors that need to be considered. The Lakers' last trial with LeBron, and the outlook for the 2023-24 season, is definitely something to look forward to.</p>"},{"location":"20231205091240313867/","title":"\u9810\u8a08\u5728\u6771\u5340\u4e2d\u6e38\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u500b\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u5e2d\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e26\u9010\u6b65\u5efa\u7acb\u7403\u968a\u7684\u6587\u5316\u8ddf\u98a8\u683c\uff0c\u8b93\u7403\u54e1\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u66f4\u6df1\u523b\u5730\u8a8d\u8b58\u5f7c\u6b64\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7403\u5b63\u4e2d\u6210\u70ba\u66f4\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u7af6\u722d\u8005\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u7576\u7136\u662f\u80fd\u5920\u596a\u5f97\u7e3d\u51a0\u8ecd\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u9700\u8981\u6642\u9593\u8ddf\u7a4d\u7d2f\uff0c\u516c\u725b\u7403\u8ff7\u61c9\u8a72\u8981\u6709\u8010\u5fc3\uff0c\u76f8\u4fe1\u7403\u968a\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u8207\u9032\u6b65\u3002","text":"<p>\u9810\u8a08\u5728\u6771\u5340\u4e2d\u6e38\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u500b\u5b63\u5f8c\u8cfd\u5e2d\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e26\u9010\u6b65\u5efa\u7acb\u7403\u968a\u7684\u6587\u5316\u8ddf\u98a8\u683c\uff0c\u8b93\u7403\u54e1\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u66f4\u6df1\u523b\u5730\u8a8d\u8b58\u5f7c\u6b64\uff0c\u4e26\u5728\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u7403\u5b63\u4e2d\u6210\u70ba\u66f4\u5f37\u5927\u7684\u7af6\u722d\u8005\u3002\u6700\u7d42\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u7576\u7136\u662f\u80fd\u5920\u596a\u5f97\u7e3d\u51a0\u8ecd\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u9700\u8981\u6642\u9593\u8ddf\u7a4d\u7d2f\uff0c\u516c\u725b\u7403\u8ff7\u61c9\u8a72\u8981\u6709\u8010\u5fc3\uff0c\u76f8\u4fe1\u7403\u968a\u7684\u767c\u5c55\u8207\u9032\u6b65\u3002</p>"},{"location":"20231205091244229056/","title":", stating that he sees the potential for growth and success in the city.Shaq Aims to Expand NBA Team in Las Vegas","text":"<p>NBAShaq Talks About Expanding Team in Las Vegas</p> <p>Former NBA player Shaquille O\u2019Neal recently expressed his desire to have his own team in Las Vegas </p> <p>NBAShaq Talks About Expanding Team in Las Vegas</p> <p>Former NBA player Shaquille O\u2019Neal recently expressed his desire to have his own team in Las Vegas. The topic of NBA expansion teams has been gaining attention, with Las Vegas and Seattle being the top contenders. It is speculated that the expansion process may begin in 2025 after the current broadcasting contract expires. Many celebrities and businesspeople, including LeBron James and Shaquille O\u2019Neal, have shown interest in having a team in Las Vegas.</p> <p>During a charity event, O\u2019Neal was interviewed by \"The Messenger\" where he made it clear that he wants to have a team in Las Vegas. He stated, \"I want to have control of the team. Although Las Vegas has not been officially chosen as the next expansion city, if it is, I want to be a part of it. I don't want to team up with others, I want it to be all mine.\" O\u2019Neal has been living in Las Vegas for over 20 years and he loves the city.</p> <p>He said, \"I like it here. Las Vegas is a city that never stops growing. You can see new casinos, real estate, and nightclubs popping up all the time.

I would love to be a part of it.\" In the past decade, Las Vegas has become home to many professional sports teams, with all major leagues except for the NBA having at least one team in the city.</p> <p>(The Oakland Athletics are also planning to move to Las Vegas, but it has not been finalized yet.)</p>"},{"location":"20231205091249954593/","title":"Video: Former NBA top pick Joe Smith discovers his wife has been secretly running an OnlyFans account and they engage in a heated argument","text":"<p>Video: Former NBA top pick Joe Smith discovers his wife has been secretly running an OnlyFans account and they engage in a heated argument. Photo/Twitter According to the American media \"Daily Loud\" today, former NBA player Joe Smith discovered that his wife Kisha Chavis (former adult film star) is still running an OnlyFans account, leading to a heated argument. Joe Smith was the number one pick in the 1995 NBA draft, and was selected by the Warriors in the first round. Although he had a good performance in his first and second years, his performance did not improve afterwards. He was traded several times in his career and played for the 76ers, Timberwolves, Pistons, Timberwolves, Bucks, Nuggets, Bulls, Cavaliers, Thunder, Cavaliers, Hawks, Nets, and Lakers, playing a total of 16 seasons in the NBA, appearing in 1030 games, with an average of 10.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 1 assist per game. Joe Smith (right). Photo/Reuters In the later stages of his career, Smith received less attention, but recently became the focus of attention due to the OnlyFans controversy with his wife Kisha Chavis. Joe Smith and Kisha Chavis got married five years ago, and in a recent self-shot video, Smith can be seen getting upset after finding out that Chavis has been running an OnlyFans account under her previous stage name Yasmine Pendavis. \"I can't believe I found out that you have been running an OnlyFans account for these past few years. This is so disrespectful to me, you should have talked to me before doing this,\" Smith said angrily. \"This is bullshxt, this is so messed up, I'm telling you, this is so messed up.\" However, his wife Chavis doesn't see it that way. She first defends herself by saying that she hasn't been \"collaborating\" with other adult performers like she used to, and then tells Smith her reasons: \"This is my body, it's my damn choice, and when you see me, you'll know who I am... I thought I would never have to deal with this again. But unfortunately, the situation is not like that.\" The two continue to argue, with Chavis vaguely revealing that there are some financial issues in their family: \"You're acting like it's the only thing I do. I have a lot of crazy jobs, but they can't provide everything we need, so I'm looking for more money on OnlyFans, what's wrong with that?\" However, Smith says that regardless of the financial aspect, the fact that she is doing this behind his back remains unchanged. According to TMZ, Joe Smith earned a total of 61 million US dollars during his playing career, but after deducting agent fees and taxes, he only had 18 million US dollars left. In the past, he has also revealed on the show \"Back in the Game\" about the difficulties he encountered in managing his money: \"Many people think that when you sign a contract, you automatically become a millionaire, but that's not the case. No one has ever really explained to me, like when I got 3 million, the US government may take 1.5 million of it, this is something I learned from it.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231206091129761176/","title":"NBADraftLottery | @Ticketmaster pic","text":"<p>NBADraftLottery | @Ticketmaster pic.twitter.com/3i6VUWgmBlPopovich has had great success working with international players such as Manu Ginobili from Argentina and Tony Parker from France in the past, and now he may have the opportunity to build a new \"Spurs dynasty\" with Wembanyama.</p> <p>The fifth to 14th picks are the Pistons, Magic, Indiana Pacers, Washington Wizards, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks, Magic, Oklahoma City Thunder, Toronto Raptors, and New Orleans Pelicans, respectively.

Some are blessed with natural talent that makes it clear they will become NBA players, even stars. Others must put in a lot of effort to establish themselves, while many struggle and face countless obstacles to achieve their dream of playing in the NBA.</p> <p>For Wizards player Anthony Gill, hard work and an open mindset were the key to his journey to the NBA.</p> <p>Making it to the NBA is not just difficult, but almost impossible for the vast majority of basketball players.</p> <p>With only about 450 players in the entire world reaching the highest level of the NBA, the odds are about 0.01% for basketball players around the globe.</p> <p>As fans, we often see young players with great potential on draft night, but for most players, it is a harsh reminder of the reality they face.</p> <p>For many, draft night is an eager anticipation of dreams coming true for young athletes, but for others, it is a harsh reality check. The majority of players who go undrafted are forced to explore all options, some choose to go to summer league and hopefully earn a contract, or at least a chance to play in the G-League. Some choose to go overseas and play in unfamiliar environments, with the possibility of taking years to earn their ticket to the NBA. These stories often go unnoticed, even if they do succeed, it is not always a glamorous journey.</p> <p>\"In the US at least, no one plays basketball to make money overseas,\" says Gabe York, who is currently playing in the G-League. Gill agrees, having spent a total of four seasons playing in Europe after going undrafted in 2016.</p> <p>\"I never thought about leaving the US to play basketball during college,\" says Gill. \"From the beginning, our goal was always the NBA, from high school to college, everything was geared towards the NBA.\" Now 31, Gill has played in the NBA for four years since the Wizards signed him in 2020 after his time in Europe with Khimki Moscow. While Gill's journey to the NBA was atypical, it is not uncommon. Every year, a large number of talented college players go undrafted and choose to continue their career overseas. Gill also made it to the NCAA Elite Eight with the University of Virginia, but after the season, he faced the harsh reality of the draft process. \"If you were to ask me when I went from being ambitious to being forced to be realistic, I would say it was during the entire draft process,\" says Gill. On draft night, Gill watched his teammate Malcolm Brogdon get selected by the Bucks in the early second round while he went undrafted. He still did not think about going overseas.</p> <p>\"After the draft, I still did not consider going overseas,\" says Gill. But after discussing with his agent Sean Kennedy, he began to realize that the NBA was not the only option for him. \"He told me that it was very likely that I would not make it to the NBA and I would have to work extremely hard for a slim chance.\"</p> <p>However, the young Gill was not ready to accept that and making the decision to go overseas was not an easy one. \"I remember constantly thinking whether I should take $25,000 to play in the Knicks' G-League or go to Germany and make $100,000,\" says Gill. One of the key factors in his decision was that he was already married and had to support himself financially. So he decided to go to Europe, but little did he know that reality would strike again. \"I got cut after just five days in Germany. I participated in one practice and I thought I did well, but they still cut me,\" recalls Gill. \"I thought, am I really going to fly back like this? I felt embarrassed, even Europe didn't want me. What should I do? Will anyone still want me? I even thought about just getting a regular job.\" Fortunately, Kennedy helped Gill find a team in Turkey.</p> <p>Gill took his agent's advice and worked extremely hard, believing that if he gave it his all, better opportunities, even the NBA, would come knocking on his door.</p> <p>He also enjoyed immersing himself in the overseas lifestyle. \"In my first year of marriage, we lived in a country where not many people spoke English, so we could only talk to each other. It actually made our relationship stronger,\" says Gill. He believes that having an open mindset is crucial to succeeding overseas. \"When you go to different countries, you have to adapt. Every culture is beautiful, and if you think from an American perspective, it will be difficult and hard to get along. I enjoy making friends with local players and immersing myself in their culture.\" Gill also uses language learning apps like Duolingo, Babbel, and others, but the best way to bond is through basketball.</p> <p>\"One time, I played one-on-one with 11-12-year-old kids in Turkey. We didn't have much conversation, but basketball was the best way to communicate,\" says Gill. \"Now, I tell other players with less talent, if they have the chance to play overseas, they should never give up that opportunity and fully experience the local culture.\"</p> <p>Gill's first season in Turkey was impressive, averaging 14.4 points and 6.9 rebounds per game with a 47% field goal percentage. During the offseason, he became a free agent and once again, his hopes for the NBA were reignited. However, his agent advised him against it again. \"If I went to the NBA at that time, I would only have a 2-week training camp and at most, a 10-day contract.\"</p> <p>Gill did not want to go back overseas. \"I wanted to go back to Europe. I also knew that I could make some money in Europe.\" Gill played for two seasons in Turkey before moving to Israel, then back to Turkey, and finally Russia, where he had impressive performances in each stop. In 2020, he finally got his chance in the NBA.</p> <p>\"When I saw that the Wizards were dealing with injuries, I knew I had a chance,\" says Gill. \"I knew I had a chance, but I also knew that I could fail. But I still chose the NBA because it has always been my dream.\" In his first NBA season (2020-2021), Gill averaged 5.5 points and 2.8 rebounds per game with a 44% field goal percentage. This season, he has improved to 7.5 points and 3.9 rebounds per game with a 59% field goal percentage.</p> <p>\"Every time I play in the NBA, it is a miracle,\" says Gill. \"Not everyone can make it to the NBA, and I am grateful to be here, but I know this is not the end and I still need to keep working hard.\" Gill is currently with the Wizards, but he knows that his next destination may be another country. \"I don't know where I will end up next, but I know I still need to keep working hard,\" says Gill.</p>"},{"location":"20231206091304300147/","title":"\u7a7fNIKE\u7684\u8036\u7a4c\uff01\u98db\u4eba\u55ac\u4e39\uff0c\u6642\u4ee3\u8096\u50cf\uff1aJordan\u7684\u5317\u5361\u6b72\u6708\uff08\u4e5d\uff09","text":"<p>After scoring the winning shot in the NCAA championship game, Michael Jordan's life changed forever   \u7a7fNIKE\u7684\u8036\u7a4c\uff01\u98db\u4eba\u55ac\u4e39\uff0c\u6642\u4ee3\u8096\u50cf\uff1aJordan\u7684\u5317\u5361\u6b72\u6708\uff08\u4e5d\uff09</p> <p>After scoring the winning shot in the NCAA championship game, Michael Jordan's life changed forever. In his sophomore year, Jordan showed a different side of himself, filled with confidence and a newfound understanding of his own abilities. He realized that he could be more than just a good player, he could be great.</p> <p>Before the official start of the North Carolina men's basketball season, there were a few weeks dedicated to scrimmages between new and returning players, as well as alumni. Even NBA player James Worthy, who was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers, came back to participate. Jordan's former teammates were impressed by how much he had changed. Even when playing against NBA level players, Jordan showed no fear and was able to score on them.</p> <p>Jordan's confidence now matched his physical abilities. He seemed to have broken through a barrier and realized that he could be more than just good, he could be great. His teammates, including Steve Hale and Matt Doherty, noticed that he had a target-oriented mindset, even in informal scrimmages. Typically, players try to showcase their strengths and hide their weaknesses in these games, but Jordan did the opposite. He worked on improving his weaknesses during these scrimmages. His athleticism improved even further, and he even grew taller, measuring in at 6'6\" in his sophomore year.</p> <p>Jordan's physical talents were something that could not be taught, but what impressed the coaches was his passion and coachability. He absorbed everything around him like a sponge, as his senior teammate James Worthy put it. This was a result of his hard work and determination, which made his coach Dean Smith very proud. Smith continued to help Jordan improve, showing him tapes of his own games and pointing out areas where he could improve. He reminded Jordan that defense was what ultimately won games, and encouraged him to work on that aspect of his game.</p> <p>This idea took root in Jordan's mind, and he began to enjoy shutting down his opponents on defense, even more than scoring on them. His dramatic improvement caught the attention of NBA coach Billy Cunningham, who watched a North Carolina practice and told Smith that Jordan could potentially be the greatest player in the history of the program. However, Smith, who was fiercely protective of Jordan, did not like hearing this. He believed in treating all players equally and didn't want Jordan to be singled out. He quickly responded to Cunningham, saying that they had many great players and Jordan was just one of them.</p> <p>But even Smith had to admit that Jordan was better than the others. He possessed an extraordinary talent for basketball, but also had a relentless work ethic. He also became more vocal on the court, especially in the one-on-one scrimmages in practice. No one wanted to guard Jordan, as they knew that if they lost to him, their name would be written on the whiteboard in the locker room with a number next to it, representing the number of times Jordan dunked on them during the scrimmage.</p> <p>The legend of Michael Jordan continued to grow during his time at North Carolina, where he not only showcased his incredible talents, but also his determination and fierce competitiveness.</p>"},{"location":"20231207091128844321/","title":"51-100 (click link)","text":"<p>51-100 (click link).</p>"},{"location":"20231207091140658023/","title":"Green Blooded Raptors vs Philadelphia 76ers Preseason Game Observations","text":"<p>After a long wait, the preseason game has finally arrived    Green Blooded Raptors vs Philadelphia 76ers Preseason Game Observations</p> <p>After a long wait, the preseason game has finally arrived. It is an opportunity to find the right chemistry for the team. Mazzulla has put together a twin tower starting lineup, which is the most important combination to work on, especially when the starters won't play too much time. However, I have to criticize our opening introductions, which seem to be the same every year. The creative department needs to step up. </p> <p>Some updates for today, Pritchard has signed a four-year, $30 million extension with the team. Although there were rumors about it before, it was still surprising to see him choose to re-sign in this situation. The team has White and Holiday blocking his position, and it's uncertain whether he's in the team's future plans. He also hasn't shown consistent performance. But considering his cheap salary, the team trusts him and maybe it can help him break free from his shackles. </p> <p>Please continue reading. However, there's unfortunate news at the beginning of the season. Jay Scrubb, who performed well in the summer league and signed a two-way contract with the team, tore his ACL during training. There's no further update yet, but he'll definitely have to rest for a while. It's a pity. </p> <p>Observations of the game: Starting five. Mazzulla has put together a twin tower starting lineup, with Double J pairing up with White in the backcourt. Let's talk about Horford and Porzingis' defense against Maxey, a speedy guard. They were standing too high in the Drop coverage position, giving Maxey too much space to drive. It heavily relied on White to chase and defend. </p> <p>In transition defense, sometimes the twin towers would hope the guards would help out first, but there were instances where there was no communication, giving the opponent opportunities for open shots. Although they adopt a sinking defensive position, when forced to switch and face mismatches, there were a few possessions where they would directly double team and then recover on defense. Sometimes, when sinking, Holiday would directly help defend the ball handler from the weak side, letting Porzingis take on the weaker player. </p> <p>On offense, both Double J are still on vacation. Their performance on offense wasn't great. It's worth noting that their timing and direction of picks wasn't good, causing many offensive runs to be stuck. Coupled with a cold shooting hand, the overall offense lacked fluidity. As for off-ball screens, it's the same problem, with two to three players crowding together, unable to create space. However, Porzingis had a few good high post plays, using his abilities to make pick and pop and pick and roll shots. He looked comfortable. </p> <p>Holiday was quick on defense and made a scoring run with Brown in the third quarter. However, as expected, in the second quarter, Tatum and Brown took turns attacking in the low post, causing the opponent to hesitate in double teaming due to the threat of outside shooters. At the end of the quarter, there was also an attempt at a one big and four small lineup with Double J, White, and Holiday. It's a lineup that I believe will be used in crucial moments, but there weren't many attempts at using it, so we'll have to observe more. </p> <p>Please continue reading for bench power. Even though everyone thinks the Celtics have lost depth, don't underestimate our bench players. Pritchard is the key to opening up our three-point shooting. He's confident in taking shots at a fast pace and has improved in controlling the pace of the game, with good changes in speed. He also has the ability to be a scorer, with a few plays where he took the ball, step back, and shot a three-pointer, reminiscent of the \"Fast PP.\" On the front line, Brissett and Stevens have influenced the game with their tenacity as expected. However, Kornet seemed to struggle with the fast pace, with a few butterfingers moments. Banton's offense, on the other hand, was not very promising. ---- Ubuntu \ud83e\udd96</p>"},{"location":"20231207091152811396/","title":"\u8cfd\u5f8c\u53f0\u5e2b\u6821\u9577\u5433\u6b63\u5df1\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u300c\u96d6\u7136\u6bd4\u8cfd\u7d50\u679c\u4e0d\u5982\u9810\u671f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u5011\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u53f0\u5e2b\u5927\u5b78\u5b50\u5011\u7684\u62fc\u640f\u7cbe\u795e\u548c\u5718\u968a\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\uff0c\u9019\u6b63\u662f\u6211\u5011\u5e2b\u5927\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u6301\u7e8c\u8209\u8fa6\u4e3b\u5ba2\u5834\u8cfd\u4e8b\uff0c\u4fc3\u9032\u6821\u969b\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u4e5f\u671f\u5f85\u672a\u4f86\u80fd\u5728\u7c43\u7403\u8cfd\u5834\u4e0a\u518d\u6b21\u898b\u5230\u5e2b\u5927\u7684\u8f1d\u714c\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u8b1d\u8b1d\u5927\u5bb6\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff01\u300d","text":"<p>\u8acb\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5f80\u4e0b\u95b1\u8b80</p> <p>The CBL University Basketball Home and Away Invitational Tournament, founded by National Taiwan Normal University, kicked off its first home game tonight (10/17) against the top UBA team, National Chengchi University    \u8cfd\u5f8c\u53f0\u5e2b\u6821\u9577\u5433\u6b63\u5df1\u8868\u793a\uff1a\u300c\u96d6\u7136\u6bd4\u8cfd\u7d50\u679c\u4e0d\u5982\u9810\u671f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u5011\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u53f0\u5e2b\u5927\u5b78\u5b50\u5011\u7684\u62fc\u640f\u7cbe\u795e\u548c\u5718\u968a\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\uff0c\u9019\u6b63\u662f\u6211\u5011\u5e2b\u5927\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u3002\u6211\u5011\u5c07\u6301\u7e8c\u8209\u8fa6\u4e3b\u5ba2\u5834\u8cfd\u4e8b\uff0c\u4fc3\u9032\u6821\u969b\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u4e5f\u671f\u5f85\u672a\u4f86\u80fd\u5728\u7c43\u7403\u8cfd\u5834\u4e0a\u518d\u6b21\u898b\u5230\u5e2b\u5927\u7684\u8f1d\u714c\u8868\u73fe\u3002\u8b1d\u8b1d\u5927\u5bb6\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff01\u300d</p> <p>\u8acb\u7e7c\u7e8c\u5f80\u4e0b\u95b1\u8b80</p> <p>The CBL University Basketball Home and Away Invitational Tournament, founded by National Taiwan Normal University, kicked off its first home game tonight (10/17) against the top UBA team, National Chengchi University.

In their first game in 10 years as the venue for a college basketball game, NTNU attracted over 500 students and faculty to come and support.</p> <p>In this game, NTNU tried to strengthen their defense and offense in the paint, but NCCU's starting lineup, led by You Aizhe and Mobaie, had a strong inside-outside connection, leading by double digits in the first quarter. Mobaie also had 14 points and 7 rebounds in the first half, while freshman Xu Deqi had the highest 6 assists in the game. Despite NTNU's efforts in the second half, led by Liu Lushi and Wei Penghe, to aggressively attack, the team's turnovers and poor shooting percentage were fatal in their comeback attempt, and they lost 48:90 to NCCU in the end.</p> <p>After the game, NCCU coach Chen Ziwei said, \"In the first year of NTNU's three consecutive championships, I was a player and we won the championship in this court.

And the Lin Bingsheng incident during the off-season caused a huge stir in the basketball world, adding insult to injury for the team. Please continue reading. Even in the face of the storm, the Attack Lions still have some progress before the season starts. The experienced Zhang Shuren took over as the general manager and vowed to create a whole new style of play. The team's reinforcements so far have been quite effective.</p> <p>Although there are still some areas for improvement seen in the pre-season games, the team is at least on the right track. It remains to be seen if the Purple Lions can \"strike back\" and return to the playoffs. Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions' goal this season is to return to the playoffs. Photo/ Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions Last season's record: 13 wins, 27 losses, 6th place in the regular season Please continue reading. Joining players: Wang Zigang, Liu Guangshang, Zhou Bohun, Shi Yanzong, Zhang Jiewei, Lu Guanxuan Departing players: Chen Zeyu, Ibaka, Guo Shaojie Foreign players: Artino (William Artino), Braun (Taylor Braun), Ochefu (Daniel Ochefu), Clark (Earl Clark) Will the backcourt become the new face of the Attack Lions? From the pre-season reinforcements to the performances on the court, it can be seen that the Attack Lions are focusing on one thing this year - the outside shooting. In the two pre-season games, the team averaged 39 shots and made 16.5 three-pointers. In the first game, they even made an astonishing 18 three-pointers, which accounted for more than half of the team's points. This is quite different from the team's usual playing style. It's worth noting that in the previous three seasons, the Attack Lions' average three-point attempts per game did not exceed 30, and their 29.5% three-point shooting percentage and 28.3 attempts per game in the previous season were among the lowest in the league. This year, however, they have changed their style and become a team that relies on the outside shooting for offense.</p> <p>Looking at the players' positioning on the court during the pre-season games, it's clear that the Attack Lions have designated shooters in both the 45-degree and corner areas, and they don't hesitate to take shots when they have an open opportunity. Head coach Lin Guanlun also encourages his players to shoot whenever they have an open shot.</p> <p>New additions Wang Zigang and Lu Guanxuan are both renowned shooters, with Lu Guanxuan having a three-point shooting percentage of over 40% last season and even winning the T1 League three-point shooting contest.</p> <p>In addition to these two players, the team also has Kao Guohao and Zhu Yunhao, who pose a threat from the outside. The three new foreign players also showed their shooting abilities, so if everything goes well, the Attack Lions' outside shooting might become a force to be reckoned with this season.</p> <p>Please continue reading. Too many guards on the team However, the biggest problem the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions will face this season is the abundance of guards. After being plagued by injuries to guards last season, the team strengthened their backcourt during the off-season. In addition to Wang Zigang and Lu Guanxuan, they also added former Steelmen foreign player Zhang Jiewei. With six original guards on the team, the Attack Lions now have a total of nine guards, which is quite a lot. However, with Wang Zigang and Zhang Jiewei injured and Tian Hao yet to return, the current six guards may not be a problem for coach Lin Guanlun. But when the injured players return, it will be a challenge for the coaching staff to allocate playing time for each player.</p> <p>The good news is that this season, the PLG has changed the foreign player rule to 8 games per game. This will reduce the team's disadvantage in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>Currently, it seems that Kao Guohao will pair up with Lu Guanxuan as the starting guards.</p> <p>Zeng Boyu, who comes off the bench, averaged 5.4 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 1.5 assists last season. Although it's not a standout performance, he can play positions 1-3 and should get plenty of playing time in the early stages of the season. Other bench players like Jiang Guangqian, Lu Qimin, and Song Yuxuan may gradually fade out of the team if they can't earn the coach's favor.</p> <p>Who will solve the problem of offensive breakdowns? In the official pre-season games, the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions suffered two consecutive losses. Although they played well, the biggest problem came in the third quarter. In both games, the Attack Lions had a double-digit lead at one point, but they suddenly had trouble scoring after scoring easy baskets.</p> <p>During that period, no player on the team was able to step up and score or lead the team, which became the turning point of the game. If we were to choose one local player and one foreign player, I would choose Kao Guohao and Clark.</p> <p>Clark has shown a highly efficient performance in the pre-season, and although he is 35 years old, he still has an impressive shooting touch, and he is also a solid player on both offense and defense. In the two pre-season games, he averaged 13.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks in just 17 minutes per game. If Clark can adjust to his new team and his chemistry with the team improves, he could put up some impressive numbers. Kao Guohao, the team's number one scorer last season with an average of 14.9 points per game, made it onto the second team of the year, and it seems that he has improved on both ends of the court this year. In the first pre-season game, he recorded an all-around performance of 20 points, 4 rebounds, and 5 steals. I personally believe that he can take his game to the next level this season, and I predict he will average between 18-20 points per game.</p> <p>If Clark and Kao Guohao are the team's main scorers, then Ochefu is the last line of defense for the Attack Lions. Ochefu is a big man who can defend against many opponents in the paint, and the team's struggles in defending the paint last season were an issue. Ochefu is making his first appearance in Taiwan, but his size and playing style have left a deep impression on people. Although he only averaged 4.5 points in the two pre-season games, his contributions on the defensive end are believed to be greater than his stats.</p> <p>Please continue reading. Clark, who can score but is a weaker defender, is the opposite of Braun, who is a strong outside shooter but needs to improve on the defensive end. In comparison, Zhu Yunhao and Ochefu seem to have more stable defensive abilities, but they may not be as consistent on the offensive end as Braun. Of course, this is just based on the performances in the pre-season games, and we'll have to wait and see how things pan out in the actual games this season before making a final judgment.</p> <p>Although the four foreign players all have their own strengths, Lin Guanlun still faces a dilemma of how to get the best out of all four players and build chemistry with the local players in order to overcome their offensive breakdowns.</p> <p>Please continue reading. Summary: After going through a tumultuous off-season, the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions still have some progress before the season starts. Not only have they strengthened their team, but they have also adopted a new style of play, making their goal of returning to the playoffs more achievable. With their strong outside shooting, the Attack Lions will become a team that other teams need to watch out for, but at the same time, they also face the challenge of too many guards. How the coaching staff will allocate playing time for each player will be a difficult issue to solve. Let's look forward to a great performance from the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions this season!</p>"},{"location":"20231207091255710592/","title":"The Deadly Allure of New York: Once Again the Promised Land","text":"<p>For over a decade, New York has not been a city that can attract star players to join its teams    The Deadly Allure of New York: Once Again the Promised Land</p> <p>For over a decade, New York has not been a city that can attract star players to join its teams. However, this time, the team's patience may finally pay off and it wouldn't be a surprise to see New York on the list of target teams for these stars.</p> <p>Unbeknownst to many, through multiple rounds of maneuvering, including signings and trades, the Knicks have finally made it back to the second round of the playoffs after a 10-year drought. The 2023-24 season will be crucial for New York.</p> <p>Please continue reading to learn about the past 25 years of management and decision-making in New York, which will make one question whether the team's management truly had the intention of running a professional basketball team.</p> <p>One word to describe the Knicks of the past: chaos. From the disastrous reign of Isiah Thomas as the general manager, to the shocking resignation of Donnie Walsh, to the sudden firing of Glen Grunwald, to giving Phil Jackson full control, and even making Derek Fisher the head coach, not to mention drafting Kevin Knox II, the Knicks have been making a series of baffling and questionable moves both on and off the court. This chaos has led to another word: failure.</p> <p>The victory over the Cavaliers last year was only the second time the Knicks have advanced to the second round of the playoffs since 2000. The majority of the Knicks' problems stem from within, and anyone who pays even a little attention to the NBA knows that the root of the problem lies with owner James Dolan. However, in recent times, Dolan has become less involved in the team's operations, allowing for more stability and successful management under Leon Rose, William Wesley, Tom Thibodeau, and Scott Perry (who has since been let go). \"He has a lot of faith and trust in our basketball operations department,\" said Rose when asked about Dolan's notorious reputation. \"We still believe that the Knicks are an attractive and powerful team.\" Last season, the Knicks had a top three offense in the entire NBA, with a strong emphasis on offensive rebounds and controlling turnovers, slowing down the pace of the game, creating mismatches, and countering with Julius Randle and Jalen Brunson's one-on-one skills, while also creating opportunities and counterattacks for their teammates. The Knicks have ranked in the bottom of the league for true shooting percentage for nine consecutive seasons, second only to the Dallas Mavericks in terms of isolation, and last in terms of assist rate.</p> <p>This configuration is not the typical formula for a championship team, especially with below-average defense and players not ranked in the top 20 of the league, but the Knicks have shown resilience and clutch performances, especially with the addition of Josh Hart before the trade deadline and the signing of Donte DiVincenzo in the offseason, both of which were wise moves. Hart in particular has a 58.6% field goal percentage and a 51.9% three-point percentage since joining the team.</p> <p>The players' ability to execute coach Thibodeau's game strategy is undoubtedly crucial, but from an execution standpoint, discipline and patience are more important than talent and star power. The current Knicks team is competitive, confident, and full of expectations, and they believe that in the near future, with all the factors currently in place, including salary cap and team composition, they have a chance to attract a top-tier player to join their team. Please continue reading to learn about their journey and how their current progress, which may seem miraculous at the time, was built a few seasons ago. The Knicks only won 37 games in the 2021-22 season, and they did not get a draft pick that year, instead giving Brunson a max contract and refusing to trade Donovan Mitchell, despite his high value.</p> <p>Today, the Knicks' victory over Mitchell's Cavaliers in the 2023 playoffs proves that their choices were not wrong.</p> <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid have both expressed some dissatisfaction with their current teams this summer. The current Knicks team has once again become an attractive destination for star players, with healthy salary cap space and valuable trade assets, and the ultimate incentive: being in the world's largest market, New York.</p> <p>To pursue the world's best players, preparation is crucial. The Knicks are well aware of this and have already begun their preparations. Currently, Brunson is a star player, averaging 24 points, 6.2 assists, and a 41.6% three-point percentage last season, and even increased his performance to 27.8 points in the playoffs, playing all 48 minutes in a crucial game and scoring 38 points to save the team.</p> <p>Quentin Grimes, Hart, and DiVincenzo are all essential role players, and if Mitchell Robinson can stay healthy, he will be a reliable center. Isaiah Hartenstein and Immanuel Quickley are also dependable bench players, while one of the team's key players, RJ Barrett, is only 23 years old.</p> <p>Another star player, Randle, may have high production, but his flaws are also evident. He is the leader on the court for the Knicks, and has been selected to the All-Star team twice in the past three seasons. However, his efficiency drops significantly in the playoffs and, coupled with his tendency to hold onto the ball and commit turnovers, his efficiency was low in the 2021-22 season.</p> <p>Randle set a career-high last season with an average of 25.1 points per game and his turnovers dropped to a new low since joining the Knicks, but with the addition of Brunson, it is evident that his abilities and efficiency have been unleashed. However, in the playoffs, Randle's statistics and efficiency took a major hit, with only 16.6 points per game and poor shooting percentages of 37.4/25.8/70.9, clearly struggling in high-intensity games.</p> <p>Randle's performance is directly correlated to the team's overall performance. The Knicks' turnover rate and true shooting percentage dropped significantly in the playoffs, and their opponents were able to exploit their weaknesses. The Knicks need Randle to step up as a leader in crucial moments, rather than being restricted like in last season's playoffs. This is also one of the issues that Thibodeau needs to address.</p> <p>As the Knicks continue to make progress, the team's management will not stop there. They still have many decisions to make, including whether to re-sign Brunson and Hartenstein, whether to target DiVincenzo and Hart in trades, and whether to trade Randle and try to attract a top-tier player to join the team in the future.</p> <p>New York has once again become a promised land, and this time, their attractiveness does not just lie in the bright lights and economic power of the city, but also in the stability of the team's management and the competitiveness of the players. The Knicks have reached a turning point, and as long as they can maintain their current momentum and progress, it is only a matter of time before they become a dominant force in the NBA once again.</p>"},{"location":"20231207091317394491/","title":"202324 Season Analysis: Portland Trail Blazers New Generation","text":"<p>The Portland Trail Blazers have been one of the most talked about teams in the past month   202324 Season Analysis: Portland Trail Blazers New Generation</p> <p>The Portland Trail Blazers have been one of the most talked about teams in the past month. After a summer full of trade rumors, team leader Damian Lillard finally settled on his future destination before the start of the season. With the subsequent Jrue Holiday trade, the Blazers have quickly undergone a transformation, acquiring a large number of future draft picks and establishing a young core.</p> <p>With this, the 11-season \"Dame Era\" has come to an end, and the Blazers will welcome a new generation led by Scoot Henderson. Scoot Henderson will carry the banner for the new generation of the Blazers. </p> <p>Roster Changes: In: Scoot Henderson (draft), Kris Murray (draft), Rayan Rupert (draft), Deandre Ayton (trade), Keon Johnson (trade), Malcolm Brogdon (trade), Drew Eubanks (FA), Justise Winslow (FA), Toumani Camara (trade), Cam Reddish (FA) Out: Damian Lillard (trade), Jusuf Nurki\u0107 (trade), Nassir Little (trade)</p> <p>**Jerami Grant, Matisse Thybulle, and Kevin Knox have re-signed as free agents and are not included in the table.</p> <p>After a draft and two trades, the Blazers have replaced up to 7 players, which is half of their roster.</p> <p>Aside from Malcolm Brogdon, who was acquired in a trade with the Celtics, the rest of the new additions are all under 30 years old.</p> <p>The average age of the Blazers' roster is 23.7, with four rookies expected to play a significant role. It is clear that the Blazers have a strong intention to revamp their team.</p> <p>Although Jerami Grant and Matisse Thybulle have been re-signed, under the management of Joe Cronin, it is not certain if they will still be on the team by the end of the season. The same goes for Malcolm Brogdon and Robert Williams, who were acquired in trades. Setting aside any future transactions, the Blazers are expected to start the season with the highly anticipated Scoot Henderson as their starting point guard, alongside Anfernee Simons.</p> <p>Deandre Ayton, who came in through a three-team trade, will be the starting center, while the newly re-signed Jerami Grant and Matisse Thybulle are expected to start in the frontcourt. Last season's Sixth Man of the Year, Malcolm Brogdon, will continue to lead the second unit and join forces with the highly anticipated Shaedon Sharpe.</p> <p>Rotation: Starter: Scoot Henderson, Anfernee Simons, Matisse Thybulle, Jerami Grant, Deandre Ayton Bench: Malcolm Brogdon, Shaedon Sharpe, Kris Murray, Jabari Walker, Robert Williams</p> <p>Brogdon is willing to take on the role of mentor for the rookies.</p> <p>The focus of the Blazers this season is not just their record, but the growth of their young players.</p> <p>With almost half of their roster being rookies or second-year players, it is clear that the Blazers have a strong intention to revamp their team. In terms of talent, Shaedon Sharpe and this year's third overall pick, Scoot Henderson, have the potential to make a name for themselves in the league, but they still lack experience.</p> <p>As the season progresses, can the young players, led by Scoot, continue to improve with more experience? Can the Blazers properly develop and guide these young players? Their development not only affects the team's performance this season but also the team's future in the coming years. The most exciting thing about young players is their potential for growth.</p> <p>Even though their performance in the preseason was not ideal, once these young Blazers adapt to the pace of the NBA, they may surprise everyone in the later part of the season.</p> <p>In addition to the backcourt, rookies Kris Murray, Rayan Rupert, and Toumani Camara are expected to get significant playing time in the frontcourt, and it will be up to them to seize the opportunity.</p> <p>The Focus: Despite acquiring two big men through trades, it is clear that the Blazers' roster is still unbalanced. The backcourt is crowded with talent and depth, with players like Henderson, Simons, and Brogdon all needing the ball in their hands. Sharpe also needs the opportunity to develop his skills with the ball. The key for the Blazers will be how they can distribute the ball and organize their offense. From the preseason, it is evident that Scoot has excellent passing vision, but his lack of shooting ability will need to be addressed by outside shooters creating space for him.</p> <p>Can Simons live up to the high expectations of the team after gaining more opportunities with the ball? Is Sharpe's performance at the end of last season genuine? These questions will be answered as the season progresses.</p> <p>In the frontcourt, Jerami Grant and Matisse Thybulle are the two pillars of the team, and Deandre Ayton is the biggest wild card this season. Grant's shooting ability will be crucial for the Blazers, and Thybulle is the team's best defensive player. Ayton has shown promise in the preseason, but whether he can continue this performance in the regular season remains to be seen.</p> <p>Overall, the Blazers will enter a new era this season with a new generation of players. The growth of their young players will be the key to the team's performance. Aside from player development, the management's planning and execution will also determine the Blazers' future direction. Let's hope this new generation of the Blazers can bring excitement to the fans and create a new era for the team. </p>"},{"location":"20231207091338356442/","title":"16-year-old mixed-race player Jacob Zhu has expressed interest in playing for the Chinese men's basketball team","text":"<p>16-year-old mixed-race player Jacob Zhu has expressed interest in playing for the Chinese men's basketball team.

This decision was made by the East Asian Basketball Association without any prior discussions with other member countries. Instead of using a qualification match, the association decided to use rankings to determine the participating teams, which ultimately resulted in our country being ranked fourth in East Asia and unable to participate in the championship. The Basketball Association has already filed a protest against this decision.</p> <p>In the past, out of the 16 participating teams in the U16 Asian Youth Championship, the host country and defending champion automatically qualify, while the West Asia, East Asia, and Persian Gulf regions each have two spots, and the remaining three regions and Oceania have one spot each. The remaining four spots are determined based on the performance of each region in the previous championship. However, this year, the East Asian region was granted \"2+1\" spots. Secretary-General of the Chinese Basketball Association, Li Yunxiang, explained that they did not receive any information about the championship and after inquiring with other participating countries and contacting the Asian Basketball Confederation, they were informed that each region's participation is determined by the respective regional basketball associations. However, the East Asian region, without a meeting with the other member countries, decided to use rankings instead of a qualification match to determine the participating teams. As a result, our country was unable to participate as we were ranked behind China, Japan, and South Korea in the East Asian region.</p> <p>Li Yunxiang emphasized that this decision by the East Asian Basketball Association was made without the knowledge of other member countries, including Hong Kong and Macau. South Korea and Japan only found out that our country was not on the list during a U16 video conference. This prompted the Basketball Association to file a protest and request the meeting records. The Secretary-General of the Macau Basketball Association, Hu Shufen, who also serves as the Secretary-General of the East Asian Basketball Association, personally apologized for the situation. However, it was too late to change the fact that our country will not be participating in the championship this year. The coaching staff and some members of our U16 representative team had recently participated in the East Asian Youth Games in Ulaanbaatar, where they won a silver medal. To prevent this news from affecting the players' morale, the Basketball Association only informed them of the possibility of not participating in the championship after the tournament. They also proposed the possibility of participating in other competitions to continue training, but with the HBL qualification games approaching, many schools want their players to return early.</p>"},{"location":"20231207091352589886/","title":"\u6839\u64da\u7403\u968a\u91ab\u7642\u90e8\u9580\u8868\u793a\uff0cSimons\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u63a5\u53d7\u6cbb\u7642\u548c\u5eb7\u5fa9\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u50b7\u52e2\u6062\u5fa9\u60c5\u6cc1\u5c07\u6703\u6301\u7e8c\u89c0\u5bdf\u3002","text":"<p>NBA player Anfernee Simons is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks after sustaining a sprained thumb ligament on the inner side of his hand in the opening game against the Clippers   \u6839\u64da\u7403\u968a\u91ab\u7642\u90e8\u9580\u8868\u793a\uff0cSimons\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u63a5\u53d7\u6cbb\u7642\u548c\u5eb7\u5fa9\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u50b7\u52e2\u6062\u5fa9\u60c5\u6cc1\u5c07\u6703\u6301\u7e8c\u89c0\u5bdf\u3002</p> <p>NBA player Anfernee Simons is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks after sustaining a sprained thumb ligament on the inner side of his hand in the opening game against the Clippers.

Road Trip</p> <p>In the first week of the 2023-24 season, the Thunder faced injuries as Kenrich Williams and Jaylin Williams were sidelined due to wrist and foot injuries, leaving only center Chet Holmgren and two-way player Olivier Sarr to finish the opening games... Please continue reading.</p> <p>Fortunately, the Thunder had a good performance in the first week of the season. They defeated the Bulls in their opener and then went on to face the Cavaliers on the road. With an 18-5 run in the final 2 minutes and 40 seconds, they came back to win their second consecutive game.</p> <p>In their home opener, the Thunder faced the defending champions, the Nuggets, and suffered a 33-point loss. However, they quickly regrouped and defeated the Pistons the next day, finishing the week with 3 wins and 1 loss.</p> <p>Looking back at the first game against the Bulls, both teams were neck and neck in the first three quarters with multiple lead changes. However, in the third quarter, the Thunder's guards were able to find open teammates on the perimeter, while the Bulls struggled with their outside shooting. In the fourth quarter, the Thunder pulled away with a series of three-pointers and secured the victory. In the next game against the Cavaliers, who were missing Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen, both teams had strong defensive performances, resulting in a low-scoring game. Despite Donovan Mitchell's 43 points for the Cavaliers, the Thunder managed to come back and win thanks to Luguentz Dort's three-pointer and Chet Holmgren's strong play on both ends of the court.</p> <p>After two consecutive wins on the road, the Thunder returned home to face the Nuggets, but unfortunately suffered a blowout loss due to their poor perimeter shooting and the absence of key players such as SGA. However, they quickly bounced back the next day against the Pistons, with Dort and Holmgren leading the team to victory.</p> <p>This week, we saw an improvement in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's playmaking skills, as he has been able to find open teammates with skip passes and make quick decisions. As a league leader in drives for three consecutive seasons, SGA continues to excel in this area, with 54 drives in the first two games, far ahead of second place Luka Doncic and De'Aaron Fox with 36. However, his free throw attempts have decreased significantly compared to last season, which is something he will need to work on.</p> <p>Rookie Chet Holmgren has also made a strong debut, with his defensive abilities and outside shooting making him a perfect fit for the Thunder's system. Despite struggling against Nikola Vucevic and Andre Drummond in the first game, Chet has shown his versatility and impact on both ends of the court.

If someone told you these were the statistics of a first-year rookie who didn't even get the chance to compete for the Rookie of the Year award, many would say he is a bust. Even Zhang Zhenya himself may not be satisfied, as he didn't meet his preseason goal of a 43% three-point shooting percentage.</p> <p>Zhang Zhenya, the first overall pick of the draft, had a rough start to the season. Despite being labeled as the starting small forward for the Flying Monkeys, he seemed overwhelmed by the pressure and struggled with his weaknesses, even missing some of his usually reliable three-point shots. At one point, he even struggled to get playing time. However, the media did not label him as a bust yet, as his potential and impact were still evident. He had two games with 19 points and even made 6 three-pointers in one game. However, these flashes of brilliance were too short-lived. Please continue reading to find out more about Zhang Zhenya's disappointing start to his professional career, which may be due to various factors, including the immense pressure of being the second overall pick in the P. LEAGUE+.</p> <p>However, as a professional athlete, facing pressure from fans is part of the job. The writer does not underestimate this pressure, but players must learn how to handle it effectively and find healthy ways to cope with it. Another factor that may have affected Zhang Zhenya's performance at the beginning of the season was his transition to a new role.</p> <p>In National Chengchi University, Zhang Zhenya mainly played as a stretch four, relying on pick and pop plays and shooting from the outside.</p> <p>It's not news for a player with his height to play the power forward position in the University Basketball Association (UBA). In fact, if he didn't play for a school with foreign players, he might have had to play as a center. It could be said that part of Zhang Zhenya's struggles with his transition was due to his environment as a player.</p> <p>However, in the third season, the Flying Monkeys insisted on maintaining their advantage in the paint and often played with a twin tower lineup.</p> <p>Even Huang Honghan, who has experience playing in the post, didn't get many chances to play inside. As a result, Zhang Zhenya had no choice but to transition to a new role, which affected his performance. The shooter's path requires patience and a calm mindset. Just like shooting, one cannot be impatient. In the writer's opinion, whether it's fans, the Flying Monkeys, or Zhang Zhenya himself, they all need to be patient.</p> <p>And even if he is criticized, the impact a shooter can bring to the P. LEAGUE+ is significant. The Flying Monkeys' three-point shooting, which was disastrous in the second season, saw a glimmer of hope after Zhang Zhenya joined the team. The writer believes that his potential and value make him worth the investment for the Flying Monkeys. Please continue reading for the strengths and weaknesses of Zhang Zhenya.</p> <p>Strengths: Shooting, agility</p> <p>For a player who just finished playing in the UBA and is entering the professional league, Zhang Zhenya has some natural advantages. First, his style of play is more perimeter-oriented, and he is no stranger to shooting from beyond the three-point line. His smooth and quick shooting motion makes him a threat even when he doesn't have the ball.</p> <p>Zhang Zhenya's excellent three-point shooting ability may be related to his beautiful shooting form. Even if you don't know him, you can tell from his shooting form that he is a good shooter.</p> <p>Although shooting form is challenging to quantify, we still cannot prove that it affects accuracy or consistency. However, the writer believes that Zhang Zhenya's beautiful shooting form helps him become a three-point specialist.</p> <p>Moreover, as someone who mainly played the power forward position in the past, Zhang Zhenya's speed and agility are enough for him to play as a small forward. For example, in the play below, Zhang Zhenya's speed and shooting after receiving the ball are exactly what a forward should have. Please continue reading for the weaknesses of Zhang Zhenya.</p> <p>Weaknesses: Perimeter isolation skills, perimeter defense</p> <p>Zhang Zhenya's main issue is his role. It is not ideal for a player with his size to play the power forward position in a professional league, as the majority of the time, foreign players will be playing in the paint. It is unlikely that he can match their strength and weight.</p> <p>Transitioning to the small forward position seems like a reasonable strategy, but he has faced many challenges during this transition.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier, Zhang Zhenya's agility and movement are enough for him to play as a small forward. In the writer's opinion, his perimeter defense is not as bad as people think. His natural athletic ability is enough for him to play as a small forward. However, he still needs to improve his basketball skills and concepts to adapt to this new role.</p> <p>Whether it's attacking with the ball, driving to the basket, or facing screens, Zhang Zhenya still needs to work on these aspects. In the past, he mainly defended the screener, not the ball handler. As a result, he often struggles to keep up with his opponent's moves. Facing backdoor cuts also poses a challenge for him. Season review:</p> <p>Since joining the Flying Monkeys as the first overall pick in the P.LEAGUE+ draft, Zhang Zhenya has been under immense pressure. With rumors of a high salary, the expectations for him were even higher.</p> <p>However, as mentioned earlier, Zhang Zhenya still needs to go through a transition. Therefore, at the beginning of the season, the Flying Monkeys didn't immediately give him 30 minutes of playing time but let him start as a pseudo-starter.</p> <p>Even with this gradual plan, Zhang Zhenya still faced challenges. In the preseason, he only made one of six three-point attempts, and it was clear that he lacked other scoring options besides shooting three-pointers. Until November 27th, Zhang Zhenya didn't play his next game after the season opener, and he only played less than 10 minutes, almost sitting at the end of the bench.</p> <p>In the past decade, how many first overall picks in the P. LEAGUE+ have had a successful first season? The writer cannot think of any. However, even if Zhang Zhenya doesn't have significant growth in this aspect, the Flying Monkeys do not care as much about his defensive issues. After all, his shooting ability is undeniable.</p> <p>In conclusion, Zhang Zhenya is still adapting to his new role, and it will take time for him to reach his potential. However, his natural shooting ability and agility make him a valuable asset for the Flying Monkeys, and they should continue to invest in him.</p>"},{"location":"20231208091240296265/","title":"Jovic played in the World Cup while still in high school, I received my diploma two days after returning home","text":"<p>Jovic played in the World Cup while still in high school, I received my diploma two days after returning home.</p> <p>Nikola Jovic's talent was on full display at this year's World Cup.

Li Yi-Han, who has been paying attention to the sports circle for a long time, has loved playing basketball since high school and also joined the basketball team in college. Her first job after entering the workforce was as a sports reporter, showing her close relationship with sports.</p> <p>Therefore, she also views the influence of sports brands from a different perspective based on her own experiences. \"I know that this year's JHBL (Junior High School Basketball League) is sponsored by ANGO, providing customized jerseys, warm-up gear, and socks for players. I think this is a great thing. It not only means recognition for the JHBL, but also allows more people to see the strength of Taiwan's sports brand, creating a mutual support and benefit.\" Based on her experience playing basketball as a student, Li Yi-Han understands the importance of getting sponsored and encouraged for student teams. Therefore, she highly appreciates ANGO's management in grassroots sports, such as sponsoring balls and jerseys.</p> <p>Although ANGO has expanded its supply chain and entered the basketball market, it still maintains an environmentally friendly manufacturing process, which made Li Yi-Han impressed by the brand's commitment to environmental protection. Just like how a perfect jersey needs to consider not only the athletes but also the entire industry ecosystem and manufacturing environment. If a brand can also maintain an environmentally friendly mindset, it is not only benefiting the sports circle, but also contributing to the planet. A jersey represents not only a team, but also a spirit. Li Yi-Han, who has reported countless games, chose to enter this industry because of her admiration and curiosity for television work, as well as her passion and love for sports. She has been steadily advancing in her career and even earned the title of \"cutest anchor\", which reflects her innocent enthusiasm and professionalism in her work.</p> <p>Passion and perseverance are essential qualities in sports, just like in work. \"I think work is just like sports, we need to constantly improve our professionalism and skills.\" Li Yi-Han has a serious and determined attitude. Despite being under scrutiny and receiving negative comments from online bullies due to her celebrity status, she is willing to change her mindset and continue to challenge herself. \"My next goal is to improve my skills in broadcasting games, especially hoping to have the chance to broadcast my favorite basketball events and to report on the Olympic Games.\" Li Yi-Han has a clear goal, and when she talks about it, her eyes sparkle as if she is about to take a shot and score a bullseye. In the cold and wet December, let ANGO's hat T-shirt warm your heart.</p>"},{"location":"20231208091259621645/","title":"NBA enters its 21st season and needs to respond to criticisms of LeBron James needing time for people to understand","text":"<p>NBA enters its 21st season and needs to respond to criticisms of LeBron James needing time for people to understand.</p> <p>Photo/Reuters</p> <p>LeBron James is about to enter his 21st season in his career, and after Andre Iguodala's retirement, he officially becomes the oldest player in the league. During a media interview after practice today, he was asked about entering his 21st season and the constant criticism from the public during the playoffs. Does he feel the need to respond to them? LeBron's initial response was, \"I don't know.\" He then added, \"It takes time, and people will understand what I'm saying. With time, everyone will understand.\" During today's interview, LeBron also talked about his motivation for his 21st season.

The reason was that after the shootaround, Griffin told the coaching staff that he wanted to have a separate meeting, but Stotts went to talk to the players about offensive issues. Griffin asked Stotts to join the coaches' meeting, and Stotts requested some time to talk to the players, but Griffin yelled at him in front of the whole team, telling him to join the coaches' meeting immediately. Reporters speculate that this incident is not the sole reason for Stotts' departure, as he has been a head coach for several decades and may have struggled to adjust to a coaching role on the bench. Some also believe that he did not receive the respect and treatment he deserved based on his experience. </p> <p>When asked about Stotts' departure, Griffin said in a press conference earlier today, \"It was surprising for all of us, but we support him. He's a great guy. I've learned a lot from him in the few months I've been here. He's done a great job in his role. This is a personal decision, and all we can do is respect it.\" When asked about the reason for Stotts' departure, Griffin told reporters that it was not a question he should answer and should be directed to Stotts for clarification. \"You'll have to ask Terry. I'm just glad to have gotten to know him. He's a great coach and a great person. It's his decision, and I can only wish him the best.\" Damian Lillard was also asked about Stotts' departure today, to which he responded, \"We talked directly. I don't expect anything to be different. We've been in this league together for a long time. We spend 7-8 months together, practicing, flying together, staying at hotels, having dinner together, watching game footage. We're often in the same space together.\" \"Like I said, I've been playing for him for 9 years, and we've been together for a long time. Even in the two years he wasn't the head coach, we kept in touch. So when he called me directly, I didn't expect anything to be different. That's just how it is.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231209091136615103/","title":"SBL Yulon 8 players accused, Ko Min-hao alleged to be the \"white glove\"","text":"<p>On November 18, 2023, reporters Li Longgui and Zhang Hongye from the United Daily News reported from Taipei that Yulon basketball player Ko Min-hao (center) was also brought in for questioning by the Criminal Bureau in the afternoon   SBL Yulon 8 players accused, Ko Min-hao alleged to be the \"white glove\" </p> <p>On November 18, 2023, reporters Li Longgui and Zhang Hongye from the United Daily News reported from Taipei that Yulon basketball player Ko Min-hao (center) was also brought in for questioning by the Criminal Bureau in the afternoon.</p> <p>Most players were tightly controlled by Ko, who was the MVP of last season, and FMVP Banba, responsible for manipulating game results.</p> <p>Reporter Yu Chenghan/Photo CBA SBL Yulon basketball team former player Wu Jiyin was exposed to be involved in match-fixing and gambling, causing a continuous uproar. Yesterday, the Criminal Bureau conducted a large-scale search of Yulon player dormitories and residences of the involved individuals. A total of 16 people, including players, current and former coaches, and security guards, were summoned for questioning. Nine players were accused, including the Senegalese player Banba, who was once the MVP of the finals, and the well-known guard Ko Min-hao. The scandal has severely damaged the image of the Yulon team, and there are concerns that the team may be disbanded. Twelve people were transferred to the prosecutor's office for overnight interrogation, and compulsory measures are not ruled out. Wu Jiyin was found to be involved in fraud, gambling, and violation of the Sports Lottery Issuance Regulations. He was previously released on bail of 250,000 yuan. It is understood that after Wu Jiyin was released on bail, the prosecution received another report stating that other players were also involved. Some players also acted as organizers and gamblers, and made profits by manipulating game performance according to their bets.</p> <p>The relevant reports were sent through anonymous online accounts, along with dialogue records related to gambling between the involved individuals. The prosecution conducted a thorough investigation and found abnormal financial flows into the bank accounts of some players or their relatives, expanding the investigation.</p> <p>One player testified that the main figure in the case was Ko Min-hao, who acted as the \"white glove\" and worked with Wu Jiyin to manipulate games and distribute money. They used money as an incentive to recruit other players to participate in match-fixing. Even if the players did not want to cooperate by influencing the game or placing bets, they could still receive dividends after the game, with each person receiving 5,000 yuan. The details of the distribution are waiting to be investigated by the prosecution. The task force also simultaneously summoned security guard Wei Jiawei and player Li Qi'en. The summoned individuals also included Yulon's current coach Li Qiyi and former coach Qiu Dazong (now the coach of the PLG team Kaohsiung Steelmen in the CBA), to clarify whether they were aware of players involved in match-fixing.</p> <p>Li Qiyi cooperated with the summons in the morning when the prosecution arrived at his door. Qiu Dazong arrived at the prosecutor's office in the afternoon and when leaving, he told the media that \"players should just focus on playing well.\" It is reported that among the 12 accused, most of the players involved were tightly controlled by Banba and Ko Min-hao on the court. However, the two firmly denied any involvement in gambling or match-fixing, and another player was also identified as being involved in match-fixing and may be added to the list of accused.</p>"},{"location":"20231209091144275465/","title":"Cavaliers defeat 76ers in overtime","text":"<p>Cavaliers defeat 76ers in overtime.</p> <p>Photo/Reuters</p> <p>In today's mid-season showdown between the Cavaliers and the 76ers, the game was only decided in overtime.

Daniel Ochefu, also known as \"Ou Lion Fu,\" is a typical playmaking center. He serves as the second or third initiator, and is able to hold the ball and observe his teammates' movements while being double-teamed. He is able to make the right pass to the most suitable spot, making him a versatile player who can quickly adapt to any team's system. The only concern is his speed, as he seemed to struggle to keep up with the fast-paced offense of the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions. However, this could be due to his desire to conserve his energy against the shorter Singapore team.</p> <p>As for his offensive performance, we will have to wait until the official warm-up matches to see if he can contribute to the team's scoring. On the defensive end, he is solid and does not easily fall for fake moves. He carefully observes his opponent's shooting position and tries to disrupt their shot. However, his rebounding skills may need some improvement. </p> <p>Taylor Braun is a familiar face, having played for the Taiwan Beer team and the Yulon Luxgen Dinos before joining the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions. He is an all-around player who can play positions 1 to 4, but he is not a dominant foreign player. He is more of a utility player, and his impact on the team may not be as significant as Ochefu and Attinella. With Attinella and Chou Po-hsun currently preparing for the Asian Games, we have yet to see how well they can integrate into the team. Braun's value may only be fully realized during the playoffs, but this also depends on the team's coaching staff being more flexible in their tactics.</p> <p>Let's move on to discuss the local reinforcements for the team. The most notable addition is Prince Chien-kang, who played for Taiwan Beer last season. In 25 games, he averaged 31.6 minutes per game, 12.5 points, and 3.2 assists. His three-point shooting is his highlight, as he averaged 2.6 three-pointers per game with a 37.6% shooting percentage. As Taiwan Beer's leading scorer last season, he can bring a much-needed three-point threat to the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions. However, he will need the right tactics to fully utilize his shooting skills. Last season, it seemed like the coaching staff did not have a specific strategy for their shooters, and players had to create their own opportunities with their ball-handling skills. Hopefully, with the twin towers on the team, Chien-kang will have more chances to shoot.</p> <p>Another promising addition is Liu Guang-shang, who was selected in the draft but did not make the final cut. He was picked up by the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions, and we believe this was a smart move. He has a soft shooting touch, stands at 192cm, and is very mobile. In terms of potential, his ceiling and floor are higher than at least 70% of this year's draft picks. Compared to his college days, he has visibly bulked up without sacrificing his speed. This has also improved his ability to control his body after physical contact. While the Singapore team may not have a high-scoring offense, their players have a bigger build compared to the Hsinchu Formosa Attack Lions. The team should focus on improving their physicality as well. If they only prioritize speed and steals, they will be easily exposed by their opponents without a solid foundation.</p> <p>Finally, let's talk about the team's defense. FIBA referees are known to be strict, especially when it comes to physicality and collisions between players. This is something that local players need to pay attention to, discuss with their teammates, and communicate with the referees on the court. The referees' perspective may differ from the players', which can lead to confusion and frustration. It's important to understand the referees' criteria to make quick adjustments during the game.</p>"},{"location":"20231209091215247032/","title":"T1 Finds Employment, Su Yi-Jin, Lan Shao-Fu, and Bai Sa Join Taiwan Steel Falcons","text":"<p>Image/T1 Provided by Taiwan Steel Falcons Today (18), a press conference was held at the Tainan City Art Museum 2 Hall, where the team announced the addition of three new players, Su Yi-Jin, Lan Shao-Fu, and Bai Sa, who have officially joined the Falcons    T1 Finds Employment, Su Yi-Jin, Lan Shao-Fu, and Bai Sa Join Taiwan Steel Falcons </p> <p>Image/T1 Provided by Taiwan Steel Falcons Today (18), a press conference was held at the Tainan City Art Museum 2 Hall, where the team announced the addition of three new players, Su Yi-Jin, Lan Shao-Fu, and Bai Sa, who have officially joined the Falcons.</p> <p>Standing at 196 cm tall, local center Su Yi-Jin has dominated the paint in both the University Basketball Association (UBA) and professional basketball leagues.

The success of the Mavericks will rely on their ability to turn potential into tangible results.</p> <p>Therefore, the main focus of the season will be on building a new system and establishing chemistry among the players. The duo of Doncic and Irving must also find a way to coexist and lead the team to success.</p> <p>Weaknesses: Rebounding, Rim Protection, Coaching Staff</p> <p>Rebounding and rim protection have been persistent issues for the Mavericks. Doncic was the team's top rebounder last season (12.4% rebound rate), with only Powell, Williams, Irving, Green, and Holmes having a rebound rate above 6.0%. In terms of blocks per-36, only Holmes and Kleber averaged more than 1.0 (1.1 and 1.2 respectively).</p> <p>Harrison will surely be focused on addressing these weaknesses, and if there is no significant improvement by mid-season, he will likely make moves to address these issues.</p> <p>Aside from the roster, the coaching staff will also be under scrutiny, as they were deemed inadequate last season.</p> <p>Head coach Jason Kidd led the Milwaukee Bucks to the playoffs last season, but they were eliminated in the second round by the Wizards. The Bucks also lost to the Heat in the first round. Kidd's defensive strategies against his former player, Giannis Antetokounmpo, were heavily criticized, and his teams have consistently underperformed in the playoffs. It remains to be seen if Kidd can bring success to the Mavericks, who are not highly regarded by many experts. Therefore, patience will be key for the Mavericks in the early part of the season.</p>"},{"location":"20231209091232213759/","title":"NBA Can Still Dominate the League Without Going to Miami, LeBron May Have Fewer Rings","text":"<p>LeBron James caused a huge stir in the league when he left Cleveland to join Miami, starting a new trend in the league    NBA Can Still Dominate the League Without Going to Miami, LeBron May Have Fewer Rings</p> <p>LeBron James caused a huge stir in the league when he left Cleveland to join Miami, starting a new trend in the league. Yesterday, LeBron was interviewed by local reporters in Miami and was asked about the \"Heat Culture\" on the city edition jerseys of the Miami Heat this year. LeBron had previously played for the Heat and won two championships, two regular season MVPs and two Finals MVPs, so he was able to answer these questions with ease. He mentioned that his four years in Miami were a great time and he learned a lot, playing under coach Spoelstra and alongside players like Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Udonis Haslem.</p> <p>LeBron also talked about how his experience in Miami was the best, but regardless of whether he was there or not, he would always push himself to reach his limits and have the legendary career he has now.</p> <p>LeBron said, \"I feel like, whether I came here or not, I would still maintain this level. Don't get me wrong: my four years here were amazing. I loved everything about it, I loved this team, this team is top-notch, one of the best in the world.\" \"But for my own career, no matter where I am, I will continue to be myself because I know how much I have put into the game and how hard I work to be as great as possible. But what I learned here was the best, that's for sure.\" After this article started circulating online, netizens began discussing the topic fervently. Today, on a day without a game, LeBron replied to this discussion topic, saying, \"That's for sure, I'll still be (the player dominating this league), I am CHOSEN! (the chosen one), nothing will change that. Maybe there will be fewer rings, but I will still dominate from the moment I entered the league until the end of my career.\"</p>"},{"location":"20231210091128110697/","title":"T1 Powerful Offensive Firepower Support Ace Matt Mobley Joins Taipei Warlord","text":"<p>Photo/Taipei Warlord Taipei Warlord announced today that guard Matt Mobley has joined the team, adding another scoring ace to the lineup    T1 Powerful Offensive Firepower Support Ace Matt Mobley Joins Taipei Warlord</p> <p>Photo/Taipei Warlord Taipei Warlord announced today that guard Matt Mobley has joined the team, adding another scoring ace to the lineup.

Photo/ReutersAs the NBA media day events have been taking place recently, Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum expressed his surprise to Bleacher Report journalist Chris Haynes about the news of the Milwaukee Bucks potentially acquiring Damian Lillard through a trade.</p> <p>\"I was very surprised,\" Tatum said. \"Even though all summer everyone was talking about the trade rumors surrounding Damian (Lillard), I never saw Milwaukee mentioned in any of them. I had never heard that they were interested in Damian, so when I opened my phone and saw the news, I was definitely shocked.\"</p> <p>\"They will have a super talented team, that's for sure. They have two of the best players in the league who are in their prime,\" he continued. \"It will be tough to go up against them, but it will also be fun, so I'm looking forward to the new season. There are a lot of great teams in the league, so there will definitely be some exciting games in the upcoming season.\" Tatum said.</p> <p>Tatum's surprise at the potential Lillard trade to the Bucks shows the decisiveness and determination of the Bucks management. Although the trade ultimately did not happen, the Bucks' interest in Lillard also proves his value and influence in the league. For the Bucks, acquiring Lillard would have been a highly valuable trade, and it would have been a huge bonus for a team that already has two All-Star players.</p>"},{"location":"20231210091210584846/","title":"\u540c\u6642Hield\u662f\u6e9c\u99ac\u73fe\u5728\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u5927\u5c04\u624b\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4ed6\u5011\u4e5f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u5c31\u9019\u6a23\u653e\u624b\uff0c\u6e9c\u99ac\u60f3\u8981\u7528Hield\uff0c\u53bb\u63db\u4f86\u66f4\u5e74\u8f15\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9078\u64c7\u3002\u53ea\u662f\u6211\u89ba\u5f97\uff0c\u6e9c\u99ac\u7684\u9019\u500b\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9084\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u8aaaHield\u63db\u4f86\u7684\u7403\u54e1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8b93\u4ed6\u5011\u5728\u7d93\u6fdf\u4e0a\u66f4\u6709\u5f48\u6027\uff0c\u53bb\u8ffd\u6c42\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u7403\u54e1\u3002\u7562\u7adf\u6e9c\u99ac\u80fd\u62ff\u51fa\u7684\u85aa\u6c34\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u8ddf\u5176\u4ed6\u7403\u968a\u6bd4\u8d77\u4f86\uff0c\u9084\u662f\u6709\u9ede\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6e9c\u99ac\u60f3\u8981\u628aHield\u4ea4\u6613\u51fa\u53bb\uff0c\u4e5f\u8a31\u4e0d\u50c5\u50c5\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u5e74\u9f61\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u9084\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u8003\u91cf\u3002","text":"<p>\u7e3d\u4e4b\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u8a71\u984c\u7e3d\u662f\u8b93\u7403\u8ff7\u5011\u71b1\u8840\u6cb8\u9a30\uff0c\u800c\u7403\u968a\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u900f\u904e\u4ea4\u6613\u4f86\u9054\u6210\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u76ee\u6a19\u3002\u5c0d\u65bcBuddy
